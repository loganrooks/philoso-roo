# Enhanced Philosophy Analysis System Architecture

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose and Design Philosophy

The Philosophy Analysis System is an integrated suite of specialized modes designed to support comprehensive philosophical analysis throughout a course's chronological progression. The system enables:

- Chronologically-aware analysis that respects the developmental sequence of course material
- Evidence-based interpretation with rigorous textual/lecture references and extensive direct quotations
- Seamless transitions between different types of analytical work
- Comprehensive documentation of philosophical concepts, arguments, and their evolution
- Determinate articulation of philosophical concepts through both positive and negative definition
- Disambiguation of terminology through explicit contrast with potential misinterpretations
- Persistent context management to handle interruptions and multi-step analyses
- Flexible adaptation to missing materials through alternative analysis paths
- Cost-effective content generation through reference instead of duplication

### 1.2 Core Architectural Principles

1. **Determinacy**: All concept definitions must be both positively and negatively determined with explicit disambiguation
2. **Evidence**: All interpretations must be grounded in direct quotations from primary or secondary sources
3. **Chronological Integrity**: The system must maintain strict chronological progression in course analysis
4. **Context Persistence**: Active context must be maintained across sessions and modes
5. **Adaptability**: The system must adapt to missing materials while maintaining analytical rigor
6. **Verification**: All analyses must undergo systematic verification for evidence standards and conceptual determinacy
7. **Cost Efficiency**: The system must minimize token usage while maintaining analytical depth through reference over duplication
8. **Workflow Management**: All analytical work must follow defined workflows with clear prerequisites and completion criteria
9. **Interoperability**: All modes must communicate through standardized handoff protocols
10. **Content Reusability**: Generated content should be stored once and referenced many times

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Mode Structure

The system is composed of specialized modes, each with specific responsibilities:

1. **Philosophy-Pre-Lecture**: Analyzes assigned readings before lectures
2. **Philosophy-Class-Analysis**: Analyzes lecture content and integrates with readings
3. **Philosophy-Secondary-Lit**: Analyzes scholarly sources and integrates with course materials
4. **Philosophy-Dialectical-Analysis**: Analyzes dialectical movement of concepts
5. **Philosophy-Essay-Prep**: Develops philosophical essays from conception to draft
6. **Philosophy-Text-Processing**: Processes and chunks texts into manageable units

### 2.2 Shared Components

All modes share these architectural components:

1. **Chronological Management**: Controls progression through course material
2. **Evidence Standards**: Enforces quotation and reference requirements
3. **Conceptual Determinacy**: Ensures rigorous concept definition
4. **Active Context Management**: Maintains state across interruptions
5. **Verification Protocols**: Validates analyses against standards
6. **Handoff Protocols**: Manages transitions between modes
7. **Workflow Management**: Structures analytical work
8. **Content Reference System**: Enables efficient content reuse
9. **Materials Availability System**: Tracks and adapts to material constraints
10. **Real-time Updates System**: Provides progress tracking and status reporting

## 3. Chronological Management System

### 3.1 Chronological Index

The system maintains a central chronological index:

```markdown
# Chronological Index
Last Updated: [TIMESTAMP]

## Current Analysis Cycle
**Date:** [CURRENT_TARGET_DATE]
**Topic:** [CURRENT_TOPIC]

## Analysis History
| Date | Topic | Pre-Lecture | Class Analysis | Optional Components | Status |
|------|-------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|--------|
[CHRONOLOGICAL_ROWS]

## Current Position
- Current Analysis Date: [DATE]
- Completed Through: [DATE]
- Next Required Analysis: [MODE] for [DATE]
```

### 3.2 Analysis Cycle Definition

The standard full analysis cycle is:
1. **Pre-lecture analysis** (required)
2. **Class analysis** (required, or substitutable with secondary literature analysis when lecture unavailable)
3. **Secondary literature review** (optional, but required as substitute when lecture unavailable)
4. **Dialectical analysis** (optional)
5. **Integration** (optional)

### 3.3 Progression Enforcement

```yaml
progression_enforcement:
  implementation: |
    1. For any new analysis request:
       - Extract target date from request
       - Load chronological_index.md
       - Verify all previous dates have completed required cycles
       - Block progression if prior dates incomplete
       - Exception: Allow reference lookup regardless of cycle status
  
  override_protocol: |
    1. If override required:
       - Document explicit reason for chronological violation
       - Mark as PROVISIONAL in chronological index
       - Require explicit confirmation before proceeding
```

### 3.4 Alternative Cycle Paths

#### 3.4.1 Missing Lecture Transcript Path
When a lecture transcript is unavailable, the system supports an alternative cycle path:
1. Pre-lecture analysis → complete as normal
2. Class analysis → detect missing transcript → transition to secondary literature mode
3. Secondary literature analysis → acts as class analysis substitute
4. Mark cycle as complete with notation of substitution
5. Allow progression to next date's pre-lecture analysis

This alternative path preserves chronological integrity while accommodating practical limitations.

## 4. Content Reference System

### 4.1 Reference Implementation

To minimize token usage while maintaining analytical depth, all content should be stored once and referenced multiple times:

```yaml
content_reference_system:
  reference_format: "{{REF:filepath:section}}"  # Reference existing content
  unique_identifiers: true                      # For all sections and components
  implementation: |
    1. Store canonical content once in appropriate location
    2. Create rich content IDs that reflect content meaning
    3. Include metadata with each content piece:
       - Creation date
       - Source document/lecture
       - Related concepts
       - Update history
    4. Use standardized reference format to point to canonical content
    5. When displaying referenced content, include:
       - Clear indication of reference source
       - Summary of referenced content
       - Link to full content
       - Key points from referenced content
    6. Update referenced content in place rather than recreating
```

### 4.2 Content Storage Organization

```yaml
content_organization:
  root_structure:
    - concepts/                   # Concept definitions
      - definitions/              # Full determinations
      - evolution/                # Concept development
    - evidence/                   # Quotation repository
      - readings/                 # From assigned texts
      - lectures/                 # From lecture transcripts
      - secondary/                # From scholarly sources
    - analyses/                   # Analysis documents
      - pre_lecture/              # Reading analyses
      - class/                    # Lecture analyses
      - secondary_lit/            # Scholarly analyses
      - dialectical/              # Dialectical analyses
    - templates/                  # Reusable templates
    - shared/                     # Shared components
```

### 4.3 Section Markers for Targeted Updates

```yaml
section_markers:
  format: "<!-- SECTION:unique_id:start -->...<!-- SECTION:unique_id:end -->"
  usage: "All major content sections must use section markers for targeted updates"
  implementation: |
    1. Divide complex files into logical sections with unique IDs
    2. Use consistent section markers for all sections
    3. When updating, target only specific sections rather than full file
    4. For common section types, use standardized IDs
```

### 4.4 File Operation Optimization

```yaml
file_operations:
  update_strategies:
    - name: "full_rewrite"
      tool: write_to_file
      usage: "Only for new files or complete reconstructions"
    
    - name: "append_content"
      tool: append_to_file
      usage: "For adding new analysis sections to existing files"
    
    - name: "update_section"
      tool: update_section
      usage: "For modifying specific sections within files"
      implementation: |
        1. Locate section by unique identifier
        2. Replace only that section's content
        3. Leave rest of file untouched
    
    - name: "incremental_update"
      tool: apply_diff
      usage: "For minor updates to existing content"
```

### 4.5 Content Fingerprinting

```yaml
content_fingerprinting:
  enabled: true
  implementation: |
    1. Generate hash/fingerprint for all content chunks
    2. Before regenerating content:
       - Calculate expected fingerprint of result
       - Skip generation if identical content exists
       - Use reference instead of duplication
    3. For concept determinations:
       - Track fingerprints of all determinations
       - Only update when definition truly changes
```

## 5. Handoff Protocol System

### 5.1 Standard Handoff Structure

```yaml
handoff_protocol:
  format: |
    # Handoff Context: [SOURCE_MODE] to [TARGET_MODE]
    Date: [CURRENT_TARGET_DATE]
    Timestamp: [TIMESTAMP]
    Status: [HANDOFF_STATUS]

    ## Analysis Context
    - Current Topic: [TOPIC]
    - Analysis Target: [SPECIFIC_TARGET]
    - Course Position: [CHRONOLOGICAL_POSITION]
    
    ## Material Status
    - Materials Available: [LIST_OF_AVAILABLE_MATERIALS]
    - Materials Missing: [LIST_OF_MISSING_MATERIALS]
    - Alternative Sources: [ALTERNATIVE_SOURCES]
    
    ## Key Content References
    [LIST_OF_ESSENTIAL_CONTENT_REFERENCES]
    
    ## Expected Next Steps
    [SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTIONS_FOR_TARGET_MODE]
```

### 5.2 Handoff Verification Requirements

Every handoff must undergo a 7-step verification process:

1. **Date Consistency**: Verify target date matches chronological expectations
2. **Prerequisite Completion**: Verify all required prerequisites are complete
3. **Material Availability**: Check and document available materials
4. **Concept Determination Status**: Verify concept determinations are complete
5. **Evidence Coverage**: Verify all interpretations have required evidence
6. **Context Transfer**: Confirm all required context files are included
7. **Workflow Completion**: Verify current mode's workflow is properly completed

Each step must pass for handoff to complete, with targeted troubleshooting for any failures.

### 5.3 Mode-Specific Handoff Implementations

Each mode pair (source→target) has specific handoff protocols defined in their respective .clinerules files, which must include:

1. Preparation steps specific to the mode transition
2. Required file transfers
3. Specific verification requirements
4. Target mode initialization instructions
5. Content references to minimize duplication

### 5.4 Special Case Handoffs

#### 5.4.1 Missing Lecture Substitution Handoff

When a lecture transcript is missing, class analysis must initiate a special handoff to secondary literature mode:

```yaml
handoff_protocols:
  missing_lecture_substitution:
    from_class_analysis:
      preparation: |
        1. Extract CURRENT_TARGET_DATE from chronological_index.md
        2. Document missing lecture transcript in chronological index
        3. Generate secondary source recommendations based on pre-lecture content
        4. Create handoff/handoff_context.md with:
           - EXPLICIT statement: "Target date: [CURRENT_TARGET_DATE]"
           - EXPLICIT statement: "SUBSTITUTION MODE: Secondary Literature as Class Analysis Substitute"
           - List of recommended sources with justification
           - Key concepts requiring determination from secondary sources
           - Pre-lecture expectations needing validation
        5. Update chronological_index.md with "Substitution Required" status
      context_transfer:
        files:
          - "analysis_logs/chronological_index.md"
          - "handoff/handoff_context.md"
          - "prelecture/[DATE]_analysis.md"
          - "concepts/terminology_index.md"
          - "analysis_logs/active_contexts/class_analysis/[DATE]_active_context.md"
        summary_description: "Class analysis for [DATE] requires secondary literature substitution due to missing lecture materials"
    
    to_secondary_lit:
      preparation: |
        1. Load handoff context and EXPLICITLY extract target date
        2. VERIFY handoff contains "SUBSTITUTION MODE" marker
        3. Load pre-lecture analysis and expectations
        4. Initialize secondary literature workspace with SUBSTITUTION flag
        5. Load recommended sources if provided
        6. Mark active context as "SUBSTITUTION_MODE: TRUE"
      completion_behavior: |
        1. On completion, mark cycle as "Complete (Substitution)" in chronological_index.md
        2. Allow progression to next date's pre-lecture analysis
        3. Generate special notation in concept indices about determination source
```

## 6. Workflow Management System

### 6.1 Standard Workflow Structure

Each mode defines workflows that structure analytical work:

```yaml
workflows:
  prerequisites_validation:
    # Workflows that validate prerequisites before main work
  
  default:
    # Standard analysis workflows for the mode
    - name: [WORKFLOW_NAME]
      description: [DESCRIPTION]
      prerequisites:
        - type: "workflow_completed"
          workflow: [PREREQUISITE_WORKFLOW]
          required: true/false
          necessity: "necessary/optional"
      implementation: |
        [STEP-BY-STEP_IMPLEMENTATION]
      completion_behavior: |
        [BEHAVIOR_UPON_COMPLETION]
  
  specialized:
    # Mode-specific special purpose workflows
```

### 6.2 Workflow Optimization

To minimize token usage, workflows should implement these efficiency principles:

```yaml
workflow_optimization:
  principles:
    - check_before_generate: "Always check if content already exists before generating"
    - partial_updates: "Update only what has changed using section markers"
    - reference_over_duplication: "Reference existing content whenever possible"
    - targeted_operations: "Use targeted file operations instead of full rewrites"
    - checkpoint_optimization: "Store minimal state in checkpoints, use references"
  
  implementation: |
    1. Begin each workflow step with existence check
    2. Use fingerprinting to detect unchanged content
    3. Generate deltas rather than complete content
    4. Apply targeted updates to specific sections
    5. Store execution state efficiently with references
```

### 6.3 Prerequisite Management

Prerequisites define what must be completed before a workflow can execute:

```yaml
prerequisite_types:
  - workflow_completed: "Another workflow has completed"
  - file_exists: "A specific file exists"
  - concept_determined: "A concept has been fully determined"
  - material_available: "Required material is available"
  - date_condition: "Date-based condition (e.g., chronological position)"

prerequisite_necessity:
  - necessary: "Must be satisfied for workflow to proceed"
  - optional: "Workflow can proceed without this, but behavior may change"
```

### 6.4 Alternative Workflows for Missing Materials

When required materials are unavailable, workflows adapt:

```yaml
alternative_workflows:
  missing_lecture_transcript:
    detection: |
      1. Check for lecture transcript in expected location
      2. Check materials_status.md for known issues
      3. If missing, check for lecture notes
    
    adaptation: |
      1. If high-quality notes available:
         - Switch to note-based analysis workflow
         - Apply confidence limitations to all determinations
      2. If only low-quality/no notes available:
         - Initiate secondary literature substitution workflow
         - Update chronological index with substitution status
```

## 7. Evidence Standards System

### 7.1 Evidence Requirements

All philosophical analyses must meet these evidence standards:

```yaml
evidence_standards:
  requirements:
    - "All interpretations must be supported by direct quotations"
    - "All concept determinations require multiple supporting quotations"
    - "All text references must include specific page/section numbers"
    - "All lecture references must include timestamp or section markers"
    - "Analysis can use bullet points, but only to remove filler words while maintaining the same level of depth, detail, and determinacy"
  
  quotation_minimums:
    concept_determination: 3  # Quotes required for full determination
    argument_analysis: 2      # Quotes required for argument analysis
    interpretation: 1         # Quotes required for basic interpretation
```

### 7.2 Evidence Storage and Reference

To optimize token usage, quotations should be stored once and referenced:

```yaml
evidence_repository:
  structure:
    - evidence/readings/[AUTHOR]/[TEXT]/[ID].md
    - evidence/lectures/[DATE]/[ID].md
    - evidence/secondary/[AUTHOR]/[TEXT]/[ID].md
  
  evidence_format: |
    # Evidence: [ID]
    Source: [SOURCE_DETAILS]
    Location: [PAGE/TIMESTAMP/SECTION]
    
    > [DIRECT_QUOTATION]
    
    ## Related Concepts
    [LIST_OF_RELATED_CONCEPTS]
    
    ## Usage Locations
    [LIST_OF_REFERENCES_TO_THIS_EVIDENCE]
```

### 7.3 Evidence Verification Protocol

```yaml
verification_protocol:
  implementation: |
    1. For all analysis files:
       - Verify bullet points maintain determinacy and only remove filler words
       - Check that bullet points preserve required depth and detail
       - Verify all interpretations have required quotations
       - Verify all concept determinations have required quotations
       - Verify all quotations have proper source references
       - Verify negative determination for all concept definitions
       - Verify disambiguation from ordinary language
       - Verify consideration of alternative interpretations
    
    2. For lecture-based analyses:
       - Verify timestamp references
       - If using lecture notes, verify confidence limitations are indicated
    
    3. For reading-based analyses:
       - Verify page/section references
       - Verify context consideration
```

### 7.4 Bullet Point Usage Guidelines

When using bullet points in philosophical analyses:

1. **Preserve determinacy**: Bullet points should only remove filler words, never substantive content that contributes to determinacy
2. **Maintain depth**: The analysis should maintain the same level of analytical depth regardless of formatting
3. **Ensure detail**: Key details must be preserved even when using bullet point format
4. **Appropriate contexts**: Bullet points are most appropriate for:
   - Listing key features of concepts
   - Enumerating distinct arguments
   - Presenting alternative interpretations
   - Organizing evidence
5. **Inappropriate contexts**: Avoid bullet points for:
   - Complex dialectical movements requiring narrative flow
   - Nuanced interpretations requiring contextual embedding
   - Detailed explication of conceptual relations

The primary goal is to maintain determinacy while improving clarity, not to reduce analytical depth.

## 8. Conceptual Determinacy System

### 8.1 Determinacy Requirements

All philosophical concepts must be determinately articulated:

```yaml
conceptual_determinacy:
  requirements:
    - positive_definition: "What the concept IS"
    - negative_definition: "What the concept IS NOT"
    - ordinary_language_contrast: "How philosophical usage differs from ordinary usage"
    - disambiguation: "Distinction from potentially conflated terms"
    - misinterpretation_prevention: "Address common misunderstandings"
```

### 8.2 Concept Definition Storage

Concept definitions should be stored once and referenced to minimize token usage:

```yaml
concept_storage:
  structure:
    - concepts/definitions/[CONCEPT_NAME].md
    - concepts/evolution/[CONCEPT_NAME]/[DATE].md
  
  definition_format: |
    # Concept: [CONCEPT_NAME]
    Last Updated: [TIMESTAMP]
    
    ## Positive Determination
    [WHAT_THE_CONCEPT_IS]
    Evidence: {{REF:evidence/[EVIDENCE_ID_1].md}}
    
    ## Negative Determination
    [WHAT_THE_CONCEPT_IS_NOT]
    Evidence: {{REF:evidence/[EVIDENCE_ID_2].md}}
    
    ## Ordinary Language Contrast
    [HOW_IT_DIFFERS_FROM_ORDINARY_USAGE]
    
    ## Related Concepts
    - [RELATED_CONCEPT_1]: [HOW_IT_DIFFERS]
    - [RELATED_CONCEPT_2]: [HOW_IT_DIFFERS]
    
    ## Potential Misinterpretations
    - [MISINTERPRETATION_1]: [CORRECTION]
    - [MISINTERPRETATION_2]: [CORRECTION]
    
    ## Source Attribution
    - First defined: [INITIAL_SOURCE]
    - Refined in: [REFINEMENT_SOURCES]
```

### 8.3 Determination Template

All concept determinations should follow the standard template:

```markdown
## Term: [PHILOSOPHICAL_TERM]

### Direct Textual Evidence
> "[DIRECT_QUOTE_1]" ([SOURCE], [PAGE/TIMESTAMP])

> "[DIRECT_QUOTE_2]" ([SOURCE], [PAGE/TIMESTAMP])

### Positive Determination
[EXPLICIT_DEFINITION]
Note: Can use bullet points to remove filler while maintaining determinacy

### Negative Determination
[WHAT_THE_TERM_IS_NOT]
Note: Can use bullet points to remove filler while maintaining determinacy

### Ordinary Language Contrast
[HOW_PHILOSOPHICAL_USAGE_DIFFERS]

### Related Term Distinctions
- [RELATED_TERM_1]: [HOW_IT_DIFFERS]
- [RELATED_TERM_2]: [HOW_IT_DIFFERS]

### Potential Misinterpretations
- [MISINTERPRETATION_1]: [CORRECTION]
- [MISINTERPRETATION_2]: [CORRECTION]
```

### 8.4 Concept Evolution Tracking

The system tracks concept evolution through the course chronology:

```yaml
concept_evolution:
  implementation: |
    1. Store initial determination in concepts/definitions/[CONCEPT].md
    2. For each significant evolution:
       - Create version in concepts/evolution/[CONCEPT]/[DATE].md
       - Document changes from previous version
       - Link to previous versions
    3. Update canonical definition with latest version
    4. Maintain reference to version history
```

## 9. Active Context Management

### 9.1 Active Context Definition

Active context files maintain state across work sessions:

```yaml
active_context:
  structure: |
    # Active Context: [MODE] [DATE]
    Last Updated: [TIMESTAMP]
    Status: [IN_PROGRESS/PAUSED/COMPLETED]
    
    ## Analysis Target
    - Date: [TARGET_DATE]
    - Topic: [TOPIC]
    - Source: [TEXT/LECTURE]
    
    ## Materials Status
    - Available: [LIST_OF_AVAILABLE_MATERIALS]
    - Missing: [LIST_OF_MISSING_MATERIALS]
    - Using Alternative: [ALTERNATIVE_APPROACH]
    
    ## Progress Tracking
    - Current Position: [SPECIFIC_POSITION]
    - Completed: [LIST_OF_COMPLETED_ITEMS]
    - Pending: [LIST_OF_PENDING_ITEMS]
    - Blocked: [LIST_OF_BLOCKED_ITEMS_WITH_REASON]
    
    ## Checkpoint History
    [LIST_OF_CHECKPOINTS_WITH_TIMESTAMPS]
```

### 9.2 Checkpoint System

Checkpoints enable recovery from interrupted work:

```yaml
checkpoint_system:
  implementation: |
    1. Create checkpoints at logical completion points:
       - After completing workflow steps
       - After determining concepts
       - After analyzing sections
       - At timed intervals (15 minutes)
    
    2. Optimize checkpoint storage:
       - Store only state changes since last checkpoint
       - Use references to existing content
       - Track position information precisely
       - Include resumption instructions
```

### 9.3 Resumption Protocol

When resuming work, the system follows this protocol:

```yaml
resumption_protocol:
  implementation: |
    1. Load most recent active context file
    2. Present clear status summary
    3. Verify chronological integrity
    4. Reload required context from references
    5. Position at exact resumption point
    6. Present clear next steps
    7. Resume workflow from appropriate point
```

### 9.4 Specialized Active Context Types

#### 9.4.1 Substitution Mode Context

When secondary literature substitutes for class analysis, the active context includes:

```markdown
# Active Context: [DATE] [SECONDARY_LIT_AS_CLASS_SUBSTITUTE]
Last Updated: [TIMESTAMP]
Status: [IN_PROGRESS/PAUSED/COMPLETED]
Substitution Mode: TRUE

## Missing Materials
- Type: Lecture Transcript
- Date: [DATE]
- Topic: [TOPIC]

## Substitution Sources
1. [SOURCE_1] - Status: [COMPLETE/IN_PROGRESS/PENDING]
   - Relevance: [EXPLANATION]
   - Coverage: [TOPICS_COVERED]
2. [SOURCE_2] - Status: [COMPLETE/IN_PROGRESS/PENDING]
   - Relevance: [EXPLANATION]
   - Coverage: [TOPICS_COVERED]

## Required Coverage from Pre-Lecture
[LIST_OF_CONCEPTS_AND_ARGUMENTS_NEEDING_COVERAGE]

## Progress Tracking
- Concepts Determined: [X]/[TOTAL]
- Arguments Analyzed: [X]/[TOTAL]
- Pre-lecture Expectations Addressed: [X]/[TOTAL]

## Checkpoints
[STANDARD_CHECKPOINT_CONTENT]
```

## 10. Mode-Specific Implementations

### 10.1 Pre-Lecture Mode

**Primary Role**: Analyze assigned readings before lectures

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Analyze assigned texts with extensive direct quotation
- Determine key philosophical concepts with positive and negative definitions
- Identify arguments and their structure
- Generate questions for lectures
- Create preliminary concept determinations
- Maintain active context for multi-part readings
- Track chronological progression through assigned materials
- Generate expectations for upcoming lecture
- Check for reading comprehension gaps

**Cost Optimization Strategies**:
- Reference evidence repository instead of duplicating quotes
- Use section markers for targeted updates
- Create reusable templates for common analyses
- Update only changed sections when revising
- Reference shared concept determinations
- Use incremental updates for multi-stage analyses

**Key Workflows**:
1. Initialize pre-lecture analysis or resume from active context
2. Analyze readings with extensive quotation
3. Determine concepts with both positive and negative articulation
4. Identify and map arguments
5. Generate lecture questions
6. Update active context with checkpoint
7. Prepare handoff to class analysis

**Handoff Protocols**:
- TO class-analysis
- TO secondary-lit (optional)
- FROM class-analysis (previous date)

### 10.2 Class-Analysis Mode

**Primary Role**: Analyze lectures and integrate with pre-lecture expectations

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Analyze lecture content with extensive direct quotation
- Refine concept definitions based on lecturer's explanations
- Compare lecture content with pre-lecture expectations
- Document new concepts introduced in lecture
- Track conceptual evolution across lectures
- Maintain active context for multi-part lectures
- Track chronological progression through lecture material
- Handle lecture notes when transcripts are unavailable
- Check for available personal notes from lectures
- Create substitution workflows when both transcript and notes are insufficient

**Cost Optimization Strategies**:
- Reference existing concept determinations from pre-lecture
- Store lecture quotes in evidence repository, reference instead of duplicate
- Update only specific sections of concept determinations when refining
- Use section markers for targeted updates to analyses
- Reference shared chronological tracking instead of duplicating
- Apply fingerprinting to avoid redundant content generation

**Key Workflows**:
1. Initialize class analysis or resume from active context
2. Check lecture transcript availability
3. If transcript available:
   - Analyze lecture with extensive quotation
   - Extract concepts and arguments with both positive and negative determination
   - Document terminology clarifications and disambiguation from lecture
   - Contrast lecturer's usage with alternative interpretations
4. If transcript unavailable but notes available:

## 11. Materials Availability System

### 11.1 Materials Status Tracking

The system must track material availability across all dates and analysis cycles:

```markdown
# Materials Availability Status
Last Updated: [TIMESTAMP]

## Current Analysis Cycle
**Date:** [CURRENT_TARGET_DATE]
**Topic:** [CURRENT_TOPIC]

## Materials Status Table
| Date | Topic | Lecture Transcript | Lecture Notes | Notes Quality | Secondary Sources |
|------|-------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
[MATERIALS_ROWS]

## Missing Materials Documentation
### [DATE]
- **Missing:** [WHAT_IS_MISSING]
- **Impact:** [IMPACT_DESCRIPTION]
- **Alternatives:** [ALTERNATIVE_APPROACH]
- **Status:** [RESOLVED/PENDING]
- **Resolution:** [RESOLUTION_DESCRIPTION]
```

### 11.2 Lecture Notes Assessment

When lecture transcripts are unavailable but notes exist, the system assesses note quality:

```yaml
note_assessment:
  evaluation_criteria:
    - completeness: "Coverage of expected lecture content"
    - concept_specificity: "Clarity of concept definitions"
    - argument_capture: "Completeness of argument structures"
    - quote_preservation: "Presence of direct quotes"
    - organization: "Structural clarity and organization"
  
  assessment_process: |
    1. Evaluate notes against each criterion on 1-5 scale
    2. Calculate overall usability score
    3. Determine appropriate usage level:
       - High (4-5): Can use as primary source with minor confidence limitations
       - Medium (3-3.9): Use with significant confidence limitations
       - Low (1-2.9): Use only to supplement secondary literature
    4. Identify specific gaps requiring secondary sources
    5. Document assessment in materials_status.md
  
  confidence_marking: |
    1. For high-quality notes: "Note-based interpretation (moderate confidence)"
    2. For medium-quality notes: "Note-based interpretation (low confidence)"
    3. For low-quality notes: "Note-based interpretation (minimal confidence, requires verification)"
```

### 11.3 Source Recommendation System

When lecture materials are unavailable, the system generates targeted secondary source recommendations:

```yaml
source_recommendation:
  triggers:
    - missing_lecture_transcript
    - explicit_research_request
    - knowledge_gap_detection
  
  implementation: |
    1. Extract key concepts and arguments from pre-lecture analysis
    2. Identify course themes relevant to current date
    3. Generate search parameters based on:
       - Author names from primary texts
       - Key philosophical terms identified in pre-lecture
       - Historical context of primary texts
       - Course-specific methodological approaches
    4. Prioritize sources based on:
       - Relevance to specific concepts needing determination
       - Coverage of expected lecture topics
       - Scholarly reputation and authority
       - Accessibility and availability
    5. Generate structured recommendations with relevance justification
  
  recommendation_format: |
    ## Recommended Secondary Sources
    
    ### Primary Recommendations (High Priority)
    1. [AUTHOR], [TITLE], [PUBLICATION]
       - Relevance: [SPECIFIC_RELEVANCE_TO_CURRENT_TOPICS]
       - Key concepts covered: [CONCEPT_LIST]
       - Specific chapter/section recommendations: [SECTIONS]
    
    ### Secondary Recommendations
    [ADDITIONAL_SOURCES_WITH_RELEVANCE]
    
    ### Search Parameters
    If sources unavailable, recommended search terms:
    - [TERM_1], [TERM_2], [TERM_3]
    - Combinations: "[TERM_1] AND [TERM_2]"
```

## 12. Real-Time Updates System

### 12.1 Status Reporting

The system provides real-time status updates during operation:

```yaml
status_reporting:
  format: |
    [MODE: [CURRENT_MODE]][DATE: [CURRENT_TARGET_DATE]][Status: [CURRENT_STATUS]]
    Current action: [CURRENT_ACTION]
    Progress: [PROGRESS_PERCENTAGE]%
    Last completed: [LAST_COMPLETED_SECTION]
  frequency: high
  priority_levels:
    - critical
    - warning
    - info
  
  cost_optimization: |
    1. For frequent status updates, use minimal format
    2. Update status in-place rather than generating new reports
    3. Use incremental status changes rather than full status reports
    4. Apply fingerprinting to avoid redundant status generations
```

### 12.2 Progress Tracking

The system tracks progress through analytical workflows:

```yaml
progress_tracking:
  metrics:
    - name: evidence_coverage
      calculation: "direct_quotes / interpretive_claims * 100"
      threshold: 90%
      display: "Evidence: [VALUE]% ([STATUS])"
    
    - name: determination_coverage
      calculation: "concepts_with_full_determination / total_concepts * 100"
      threshold: 95%
      display: "Determination: [VALUE]% ([STATUS])"
    
    - name: disambiguation_coverage
      calculation: "disambiguated_terms / ambiguous_terms * 100"
      threshold: 90%
      display: "Disambiguation: [VALUE]% ([STATUS])"
  
  display_format: |
    Progress Dashboard:
    - Analysis: [ANALYSIS_PROGRESS]%
    - Items completed: [COMPLETED_ITEMS]/[TOTAL_ITEMS]
    - [EVIDENCE_COVERAGE]
    - [DETERMINATION_COVERAGE]
    - [DISAMBIGUATION_COVERAGE]
  
  cost_optimization: |
    1. Store progress metrics in separate file
    2. Update only changed metrics
    3. Use reference to progress file rather than regenerating
    4. Apply incremental updates to progress tracking
```

### 12.3 Completion Metrics

The system tracks completion status for analytical tasks:

```yaml
completion_metrics:
  - name: required_sections
    check: "all required sections exist and have content"
    display: "[SECTION]: [STATUS]"
  
  - name: evidence_standards
    check: "all interpretations have required evidence"
    display: "Evidence standards: [STATUS]"
  
  - name: determination_standards
    check: "all concepts have complete determination"
    display: "Determination standards: [STATUS]"
  
  cost_optimization: |
    1. Store completion state in structured format
    2. Update only changed completion states
    3. Use fingerprinting to detect unchanged completion status
    4. Apply incremental updates to completion metrics
```

## 13. Implementation Guidelines
