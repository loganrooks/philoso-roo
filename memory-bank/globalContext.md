# Decision Log
### [2025-05-01 13:26:00] - Decision: Re-delegate Phase 1 Step 1 (Asset Review)
- **Decision**: Re-delegate Phase 1, Step 1 to Architect mode due to user correction regarding the existence and location of `.clinerules` files.
- **Rationale**: Initial delegation was based on incorrect information that `.clinerules` files were missing. Correct information (files exist in root) requires re-analysis by Architect. Previous output (`architecture_review_summary.md`) is invalid.
- **Outcome**: New task created for Architect with corrected instructions and file paths. [See Active Context: 2025-05-01 13:26:00]
### [2025-05-01 13:10:14] - Decision: Plan Hegel Mode Enhancement
- **Decision**: Develop a detailed task prompt and implementation plan for refactoring and enhancing the custom Hegel philosophy RooCode suite.
- **Rationale**: Address user request to improve essay writing capabilities, reference accuracy, hallucination prevention, and memory management within the existing mode structure, following RooCode standards.
- **Outcome**: Created `philosophy_mode_improvement_plan.md` outlining architecture changes, new modes (orchestrator, potential support modes), refactoring steps, memory system design, verification procedures, and configuration structure for handover to SPARC Orchestrator.

### [2025-05-01 14:00:00] - Progress Update: Hegel Mode Enhancement
- **Status**: Phase 1, Step 1 (Review Existing Assets - Re-run) **Completed**.
- **Details**: Architect mode successfully re-analyzed existing assets (`architectureV10.md`, `.clinerules-*` files) and produced `architecture_review_summary_v2.md`. [See Active Context: 2025-05-01 13:38:00]
- **Next Step**: Initiating Phase 1, Step 2 (Design New Architecture). [See Active Context: 2025-05-01 14:00:00]
