### [2025-05-05 05:46:00] - Decision: Revise Plan Based on V18.3.3 Evaluation
- **Decision**: Based on the findings in the V18.3.3 evaluation report (`docs/reports/architecture_v18_evaluation_v1.md` v7), revise the implementation plan. Prioritize addressing foundational gaps before proceeding with `.clinerules` implementation.
- **Rationale**: The evaluation identified critical risks and gaps, particularly regarding MCP integration (undefined strategy) and distributed KB maintenance (complexity, testing needs), that must be addressed to ensure a robust and functional system. Proceeding directly to `.clinerules` implementation is premature.
- **Revised Plan Sequence**:
    1. Correct architecture diagram (`docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md`).
    2. Create MCP Integration Blueprint (`docs/blueprints/mcp_integration_v1.md`).
    3. Enhance `.clinerules` standard (`docs/standards/clinerules_standard_v1.md`).
    4. Define Testing Strategy (`docs/testing/strategy_v1.md`) incl. KB maintenance plan (`docs/testing/kb_maintenance_plan_v1.md`).
    5. Resume `.clinerules` implementation based on refined artifacts.
- **Outcome**: Implementation plan revised. Next step is to delegate the architecture diagram correction.

### [2025-05-04 21:33:00] - Decision: Adopt V18.3.3 Architecture (KB Script Re-evaluation)
- **Decision**: Adopt V18.3.3 architecture as defined in `docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md`. Key change from V18.3.2: Removed `philosophy-kb-doctor` mode and reliance on external maintenance scripts based on user feedback [Feedback Log: 2025-05-04 17:12:08]. KB validation/maintenance responsibilities reassigned to `verification-agent` and `meta-reflector`, triggered by `Orchestrator`.
- **Rationale**: Simplifies architecture, reduces external dependencies, leverages LLM capabilities within modes, and addresses user feedback questioning script necessity.
- **Outcome**: V18.3.3 architecture defined and documented, reflecting a scriptless approach to KB maintenance.
- **Cross-ref:** [Global System Patterns: 2025-05-04 21:33:00], [Global Progress: 2025-05-04 21:33:00], [Active Context: 2025-05-04 21:33:00]

### [2025-05-04 17:13:16] - Decision: Re-evaluate KB Script Necessity in V18.3.3
- **Decision**: Based on user feedback [See Feedback Log: 2025-05-04 17:12:08], the upcoming architecture revision (V18.3.3) delegated to `architect` mode must include a critical re-evaluation of the necessity and scope of `KB_scripts` (Section 4.1, etc.).
- **Rationale**: User questioned potential overcomplexity introduced by scripts versus leveraging direct LLM capabilities within modes for tasks like indexing, validation, and cleanup. This evaluation ensures the architecture balances efficiency, flexibility, and maintainability.
- **Outcome**: Architecture revision task scope expanded. `architect` mode will be instructed to assess if tasks assigned to `KB_scripts` can be handled directly by modes using LLM logic and file tools, simplifying the design if feasible.

### [2025-05-03 04:14:10] - System Pattern V18.3: `philosophy-orchestrator` Mode Definition
*Maintained primarily by Code/Architect, reflects implementation in `.roo/rules-philosophy-orchestrator/philosophy-orchestrator.clinerules`.*
- **Description:** Defines the operational rules for the `philosophy-orchestrator` mode, aligning with V18.3 architecture and `clinerules_standard_v1.md`.
- **Key Aspects:**
    - **Identity:** Manages workflows, delegates tasks, handles handoffs, routes proposals/approvals, triggers KB Doctor, manages self-correction loops.
    - **Memory Bank:** Primarily responsible for `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `phil-memory-bank/globalContext.md`. Inherits standard MB strategy.
    - **Logging:** Logs orchestration actions to `memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-orchestrator.md` using standard format.
    - **Error Handling:** Reports errors to SPARC using defined codes, logs to operational and feedback logs. Inherits standard escalation protocols.
    - **KB Interaction:** Reads KB Doctor reports (`_operational/reports/`). Strictly limited write access (operational flags only, if justified). Triggers KB Doctor via `new_task`.
    - **Workflows:** Defines key workflows (Process Source, Analyze Material, Write Essay, KB Maintenance, Meta-Reflection, Proposal Routing, Self-Correction) detailing triggers, delegation sequences, context passing, and handling.
    - **Tool Usage:** Primarily uses `new_task`, `read_file`, `search_files`, `ask_followup_question`, `attempt_completion`. Limited use of `list_files`. Write tools (`apply_diff`, `insert_content`) restricted to justified operational KB flags.

- **Description:** Defines standard structures (Simple Task Mode, Complex Analysis/Generation Mode) and guidelines for philosophy mode `.clinerules` files, aligned with V18.3 architecture (Direct KB Access, Orchestrator focus).
- **Key Aspects:**
    - Based on `.clinerules-philosophy-essay-prep` detail level.
    - Removes outdated inter-mode handoff logic.
    - Enforces strict protocols for critical workflows (KB interaction, verification, logging, error reporting).
    - Includes adaptable guidelines for philosophical rigor (conceptual determinacy, evidence standards).
    - Defines common sections (identity, MB strategy, general ops) inheriting from central SPARC config.
    - Specifies archetype-specific sections (input/output schemas, KB interaction details, workspace management, script execution, version control).
- **Link:** `docs/standards/clinerules_standard_v1.md`
- **Cross-ref:** [Decision Log: 2025-05-02 23:50:14], [Active Context: 2025-05-02 23:54:29]

### [2025-05-02 23:50:14] - Decision: Define Standardized `.clinerules` Structures
- **Decision**: Define a set of standard, detailed structures for `.clinerules` files, inspired by `.clinerules-philosophy-essay-prep` but adapted for the orchestrated system (removing unnecessary inter-mode handoff logic). Standards will include guidelines for philosophical rigor and strict definitions for critical workflows (e.g., KB interaction, verification).
- **Rationale**: Address user feedback regarding inconsistent detail levels in `.clinerules` files [See User Feedback: 2025-05-02 23:50:14]. Ensure consistency, maintain rigor, and prevent errors in critical operations while allowing flexibility where appropriate.
- **Outcome**: Decision logged. Next step is to delegate the task of defining these standard structures and guidelines.
- **Related Task**: Comparison of `.clinerules-philosophy-essay-prep` and `.roo/rules-philosophy-text-processor/philosophy-text-processor.clinerules` [See Architect Task Completion: 2025-05-02 23:19:54].

### [2025-05-02 22:27:00] Progress Update: V18.3 Implementation - Step 2 Completed
- **Status:** `philosophy-kb-doctor.clinerules` Updated to V18.3.
- **Details:** Code mode updated `.roo/rules-philosophy-kb-doctor/philosophy-kb-doctor.clinerules` to align with V18.3 architecture and specifications, defining its role in orchestrating KB maintenance scripts and managing its operational logs directly. Verified file content. [See Active Context: 2025-05-02 22:27:00]
- **Next Step**: Proceed with V18.3 Implementation - Step 3 (Update next mode's `.clinerules`).

### [2025-05-02 21:51:14] Progress Update: V18.3 Specification Created
- **Status:** Completed
- **Details:** Created `docs/specs/v18_requirements_spec_v1.md` based on V18.3 architecture, detailing requirements for rigor, direct access, workflows, KB Doctor, failure handling, and user interaction. Matched V14 detail level.

### [2025-05-02 15:54:35] - Decision: Adopt V18.1 Architecture (Rigor Enhanced)
- **Decision**: Adopt the V18.1 architecture as defined in `docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md`. Key enhancements over V18:
    1.  **Enhanced KB Schema:** Added fields for rigor elements (determinacy, presuppositions, counter-arguments, etc.) to KB entry YAML.
    2.  **Updated Mode Responsibilities:** Analysis, verification, and KB Doctor modes explicitly tasked with generating/validating rigor elements.
    3.  **Rigor-Aware Workflows:** Analysis and Verification workflows updated to include rigor checks and self-correction loops.
    4.  **Linux Paths:** All file paths standardized to use forward slashes (`/`).
- **Rationale**: Incorporates user requirements [Task: 2025-05-02 15:48] for enhanced philosophical rigor and Linux path conventions into the V18 direct-access model.
- **Outcome**: V18.1 architecture defined and documented. Ready for implementation planning/mode updates.
- **Cross-ref:** [System Patterns: V18.1 - 2025-05-02 15:54:35], [Active Context: 2025-05-02 15:54:35]

### [2025-05-02 15:28:04] Progress Update: V18 Architecture Design Completed
- **Status:** Completed
- **Details:** Architect mode created `docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md` defining V18 architecture (Direct KB Access, KB Doctor, No SPARC Coupling, V14 Detail/Context Handling). Addresses previous critical feedback [See SPARC Feedback Log: 2025-05-02 15:19:39].

### [2025-05-02 15:25:15] - Decision: Adopt V18 Architecture (Direct KB Access + KB Doctor)
- **Decision**: Adopt the V18 architecture as defined in `docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md`. Key principles:
    1.  Modes access `philosophy-knowledge-base/` directly via file tools (read/write).
    2.  Write access follows defined patterns/locations within the KB.
    3.  `philosophy-kb-doctor` mode handles maintenance (indexing, validation, cleanup) via KB-internal scripts, triggered by orchestrator, non-gatekeeping.
    4.  Strict separation between `philosophy-knowledge-base/` and `memory-bank/` maintained.
    5.  V14 source context handling retained.
- **Rationale**: Addresses user requirements [Task: 2025-05-02 15:22] correcting previous flawed architectures (V17 KB Manager). Aligns with V15/V16 principles (Direct Access, KB Doctor) while ensuring strict separation and retaining V14 context mechanisms.
- **Outcome**: V18 architecture defined and documented. Ready for implementation planning/mode updates.

- **Next Step**: Handover triggered (System reported 106% context). New SPARC instance to determine next steps (e.g., V17 specification or implementation planning). [See Active Context: 2025-05-02 13:45:39]

### [2025-05-02 13:45:39] - Decision: Adopt V17 Architecture (KB Manager Revision)
- **Decision**: Adopt the V17 architecture as defined in `docs/architecture/architecture_v16.md` (overwritten file). This revision reintroduces `philosophy-kb-manager` as the sole gateway to `philosophy-knowledge-base/`, removing `kb-doctor` and internalizing maintenance logic within `kb-manager`. Maintains strict KB/MB separation.
- **Rationale**: Incorporates user feedback received by Architect mode [See Architect Feedback Log: 2025-05-02 13:43:34] preferring a managed approach over script-based maintenance (V16), while still adhering to the core separation constraint [Global Decision Log: 2025-05-02 13:13:23].
- **Outcome**: V17 architecture defined. Next steps involve planning implementation based on V17.
- **Cross-ref:** [System Patterns: 2025-05-02 13:45:39], [Progress: 2025-05-02 13:45:39], [Active Context: 2025-05-02 13:45:39]

### [2025-05-02 13:22:51] Progress Update: V16 Architecture Design Completed
- **Status:** Completed
- **Details:** Architect mode created `docs/architecture/architecture_v16.md` defining V16 architecture with strict KB/MB separation. [See System Patterns: 2025-05-02 13:19:52]
- **Next Step**: Handover triggered (Context 49% prior reading). New SPARC instance to determine next steps (e.g., V16 specification or implementation planning).

### [2025-05-02 13:19:52] - System Architecture V16: Hegel Philosophy Suite (Strict Separation)
*Maintained primarily by Architect, reflects design in `docs/architecture/architecture_v16.md`.*
- **Description:** Architecture V15 revised to V16 based on critical user constraint: Strict separation between `memory-bank/` (SPARC operational context) and `philosophy-knowledge-base/` (domain knowledge). Philosophy-specific operational context/mechanisms (indexing, logging, status tracking related to KB content) must reside *within* `philosophy-knowledge-base/`. V16 retains Direct KB Access and `kb-doctor` (maintenance only) principles but ensures all operational aspects related to the KB are contained within its structure.
- **Key Changes from V15:**
    - `kb-doctor` operational logs/feedback moved from `memory-bank/` to a designated area within `philosophy-knowledge-base/` (e.g., `_operational/logs/kb-doctor/`).
    - Any KB indexing or status tracking mechanisms are defined within the `philosophy-knowledge-base/` structure (e.g., `_operational/indices/`).
    - Mode rules (`.clinerules`) updated to reflect these internal KB operational paths.

### [2025-05-02 13:13:23] - Decision: Revise V15 Architecture (V16) due to Strict Separation Constraint
- **Decision**: Halt V15 implementation. Revise the architecture (now V16) based on critical user constraint [User Message: 2025-05-02 13:12:52]: `memory-bank/` (SPARC operational context) and `philosophy-knowledge-base/` (domain knowledge) MUST remain strictly separate. Any operational context/mechanisms required for the philosophy workflow (e.g., indexing, logging, status tracking related to KB content) must be designed and implemented *within* the `philosophy-knowledge-base/` structure itself.
- **Rationale**: Addresses fundamental architectural requirement from the user, invalidating the previous V15 design which potentially mixed concerns (e.g., placing `kb-doctor` feedback in `memory-bank/`). Ensures clear separation between system operational context and domain-specific knowledge/operations.
- **Outcome**: V15 plan halted. V16 architecture design phase initiated. Next step is delegating V16 architecture design to `architect` mode.

### [2025-05-02 12:59:00] - System Architecture V15: Hegel Philosophy Suite (Direct KB Access)
*Maintained primarily by Architect, reflects design in `docs/architecture/architecture_v15.md`.*
- **Description:** Architecture revised based on user intervention [Feedback Log: 2025-05-02 12:46:20] to remove the `philosophy-kb-manager` gatekeeper. Modes now access the `philosophy-knowledge-base/` directly via file tools.
- **Key Principles:**
    1.  **Direct Read Access:** All relevant modes can read directly from `philosophy-knowledge-base/`.
    2.  **Defined Write Access:** Specific modes have write access to designated areas within the KB (e.g., `text-processor` writes processed source, `essay-prep` writes theses).
    3.  **KB Doctor:** New `philosophy-kb-doctor` mode introduced for maintenance (indexing, validation, cleanup), triggered by orchestrator, non-gatekeeping.
    4.  **Embedded KB Knowledge:** Mode rules (`.clinerules`) contain necessary knowledge of KB structure for interaction.
    5.  **Strict Separation:** `philosophy-knowledge-base/` remains separate from `memory-bank/`.

### [2025-05-02 12:46:20] Progress Update: V14 Halted, V15 Design Initiated
- **Status:** V14 Implementation Halted. V15 Architecture Design Initiated.
- **Details:** User intervention [See Feedback Log: 2025-05-02 12:46:20] requested major architectural pivot away from `kb-manager` gatekeeper model towards direct KB access (V15). V14 implementation plan is now invalid and halted. Mandatory handover triggered due to context (57%).
- **Next Step**: Complete Memory Bank updates. Initiate handover via `new_task`, instructing new SPARC instance to delegate V15 architecture design to `architect` mode.
- **Link to Decision:** [See Decision Log: 2025-05-02 12:46:20]
- **Link to Intervention:** [See SPARC MB Intervention Log: 2025-05-02 12:46:20]

### [2025-05-02 12:46:20] - Decision: Adopt V15 Architecture (Direct KB Access) & Halt V14
- **Decision**: Halt V14 implementation immediately. Initiate design of V15 architecture based on user feedback [See Feedback Log: 2025-05-02 12:46:20]. Key V15 principles:
    1. Remove `philosophy-kb-manager`.
    2. Grant modes direct read access to `philosophy-knowledge-base/`.
    3. Define write access patterns/locations within KB for specific modes.
    4. Introduce `philosophy-kb-doctor` for maintenance/indexing.
    5. Embed KB structure knowledge in mode rules.
- **Rationale**: Addresses user concerns about V14's `kb-manager` gatekeeper model causing inefficiency and handover risks. Aligns architecture with user preference for direct access and reduced delegation overhead.
- **Outcome**: V14 halted. V15 design phase initiated. Mandatory handover triggered (context 57%). Next step is delegating V15 architecture design to `architect` mode via a new SPARC instance.

### [2025-05-02 05:20:19] - System Pattern V14: Source Material Context Handling
*Maintained primarily by Architect, reflects design in `docs/architecture/architecture_v14.md` and `docs/specs/v14_requirements_spec_v1.md`.*
- **Description:** Defines the V14 approach for organizing source materials and handling context tags.
- **Key Aspects:**
    - **Source Organization:** Raw source materials stored under `source_materials/raw/` using hierarchical directories reflecting context (e.g., `courses/PHL316/readings/Hegel_PhenomenologyOfSpirit_Introduction.md`).
    - **Context Extraction:** `philosophy-text-processor` extracts context (`type`, `id`, `subtype`, etc.) from the source file path during processing.
    - **Context Tagging:** `philosophy-kb-manager` stores extracted context as structured tags (e.g., `context:course:PHL316`, `context:reading:Hegel_PhenomenologyOfSpirit_Introduction`) in the YAML frontmatter of derived KB entries.
    - **Contextual Querying:** `philosophy-kb-manager` supports querying KB entries based on these context tags, enabling context-specific retrieval for analysis and essay preparation.
- **Link:** `docs/architecture/architecture_v14.md`, `docs/specs/v14_requirements_spec_v1.md`
- **Cross-ref:** [Decision Log: 2025-05-02 03:40:44], [Progress: 2025-05-02 05:20:19]

### [2025-05-02 03:40:44] - Decision: Adopt V14 Architecture (Source Context Handling)
- **Decision**: Implement the V14 architecture as defined in `docs/architecture/architecture_v14.md` and `docs/specs/v14_requirements_spec_v1.md`. Key refinements include:
    1.  Standardize raw source material organization under `source_materials/raw/` using hierarchical context directories (e.g., `courses/PHL316/readings/`).
    2.  Mandate `philosophy-text-processor` to extract context (`type`, `id`, `subtype`) from source file paths.
    3.  Mandate `philosophy-kb-manager` to store extracted context as structured tags (`context:key:value`) in the YAML frontmatter of derived KB entries.
    4.  Enhance `philosophy-kb-manager` to support querying based on these context tags.
- **Rationale**: Addresses user feedback [SPARC MB Intervention Log: 2025-05-02 03:27:10] regarding the architectural gap in V13 for handling and contextualizing diverse source materials. Provides a scalable structure for inputs and enables context-aware knowledge retrieval and analysis.
- **Outcome**: V14 architecture and specifications defined. Relevant modes (`text-processor`, `kb-manager`, analysis modes, essay modes) will require updates to implement context extraction and querying. Cross-ref: [System Patterns: 2025-05-02 03:40:44]

- **Next Step**: Proceed with resolving Git debt.

### [2025-05-02 02:44:49] Progress Update: V13 Architecture Design Completed (Corrected Scope)
- **Status:** Completed.
- **Details:** Architect mode designed V13 architecture (`docs/architecture/architecture_v13.md`) and implementation plan (`docs/plans/philosophy_mode_improvement_plan_v3.md`), incorporating Philosophy KB, `kb-manager`, `meta-reflector`, and distinct Inquiry/Self-Reflection workflows. [See Active Context: 2025-05-02 02:44:49]
- **Next Step**: Proceed with V3 implementation plan, starting with Phase 0 (Prerequisites).

### [2025-05-02 02:44:49] - Decision: Adopt V13 Architecture (Corrected Scope)
- **Decision**: Implement the V13 architecture as defined in `docs/architecture/architecture_v13.md`. Key changes include:
    1.  Introduce the **Philosophy Knowledge Base (KB)** (`philosophy-knowledge-base/`) managed by `philosophy-kb-manager`.
    2.  Create new **`philosophy-kb-manager`** mode as sole KB interface.
    3.  Revise **`philosophy-evidence-manager`** scope to SPARC Memory Bank only.
    4.  Integrate distinct **Philosophical Inquiry Workflow** (using `questioning`, `kb-manager`, `essay-prep`).
    5.  Integrate distinct **System Self-Reflection Workflow** (using new `philosophy-meta-reflector` mode, `kb-manager`, `orchestrator`).
    6.  Define KB/System **modification proposal/approval workflow** via `orchestrator`.
- **Rationale**: Addresses user requirements for a dedicated Philosophy KB and *two* distinct questioning workflows (Inquiry & Self-Reflection) [User Task: 2025-05-02 02:40:02, User Feedback: 2025-05-02 00:51:03, 2025-05-02 02:28:58]. Separates domain knowledge from process memory, enhances research capabilities, adds meta-reflection, and provides controlled evolution mechanisms.
- **Outcome**: V13 architecture defined. Implementation plan `docs/plans/philosophy_mode_improvement_plan_v3.md` created. Ready for V3 implementation. Cross-ref: [System Patterns: 2025-05-02 02:44:49], [Progress: 2025-05-02 02:44:49]

### [2025-05-02 02:44:49] - System Architecture V13: Hegel Philosophy Suite (Corrected Scope)
*Maintained primarily by Architect, reflects design in `docs/architecture/architecture_v13.md`.*
- **Description:** Architecture revised based on user feedback [2025-05-02 00:51:03, 2025-05-02 02:28:58] clarifying the "questioning" requirement into two distinct workflows: Philosophical Inquiry and System Self-Reflection.
- **Key Components & Changes:**
    1.  **Philosophy Knowledge Base (KB):** Dedicated `philosophy-knowledge-base/` directory for structured philosophical content (concepts, arguments, references, etc.).
    2.  **`philosophy-kb-manager`:** New mode acting as the sole interface for reading from and writing to the Philosophy KB. Enforces schema and manages access.
    3.  **`philosophy-evidence-manager`:** Scope reduced to managing evidence packages within the SPARC `memory-bank/` only. Does *not* interact with the Philosophy KB.
    4.  **`philosophy-meta-reflector`:** New mode responsible for system self-reflection, performance analysis, and proposing modifications to the system (architecture, rules, KB schema) via the orchestrator.
    5.  **Philosophical Inquiry Workflow:** Orchestrated sequence involving `philosophy-questioning` (refining user questions), `philosophy-kb-manager` (retrieving relevant KB entries), `philosophy-dialectical-analysis` / `philosophy-secondary-lit` (analysis), and `philosophy-essay-prep` (thesis formulation).
    6.  **System Self-Reflection Workflow:** Orchestrated sequence involving `philosophy-meta-reflector` (analyzing system state/performance/logs), `philosophy-kb-manager` (querying KB for relevant system knowledge), proposing modifications, and routing proposals via `philosophy-orchestrator` for approval/implementation.
    7.  **Modification Proposal Workflow:** Formalized process via `philosophy-orchestrator` for modes (esp. `meta-reflector`) to propose changes to KB schema, mode rules, or architecture, requiring approval before implementation.
