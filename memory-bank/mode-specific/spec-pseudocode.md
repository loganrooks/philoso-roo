### Feature: V17 Requirements Specification Document
- Added: 2025-05-02 14:51:23
- Description: Created the V17 requirements specification document (`docs/specs/v17_requirements_spec_v1.md`) based on the V17 architecture defined in `docs/architecture/architecture_v16.md`. This specification details functional requirements, mode interactions, `philosophy-kb-manager` API and internal logic, operational data schemas, and performance considerations, addressing the open questions from the architecture document.
- Acceptance criteria: 1. Document exists at `docs/specs/v17_requirements_spec_v1.md`. 2. Document accurately reflects V17 architecture. 3. Document addresses core principles, structure, interactions, `kb-manager` details (API, logic, schemas), and performance.
- Dependencies: `docs/architecture/architecture_v16.md` (V17 Design)
- Status: Draft
## Functional Requirements
### Feature: V13 Requirements Specification Document
- Added: 2025-05-02 02:55:24
- Description: Created the initial V13 requirements specification document based on `docs/architecture/architecture_v13.md`. Document includes specifications for the Philosophy Knowledge Base (KB), Philosophical Inquiry Workflow, System Self-Reflection Workflow, `philosophy-kb-manager` mode, `philosophy-meta-reflector` mode, and updates to existing modes.
- Acceptance criteria: 1. Document exists at `docs/specs/v13_requirements_spec_v1.md`. 2. Document accurately reflects V13 architecture. 3. Document covers specified components.
- Dependencies: `docs/architecture/architecture_v13.md`
