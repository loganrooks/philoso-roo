### Feature: V17 Requirements Specification Document
- Added: 2025-05-02 14:51:23
- Description: Created the V17 requirements specification document (`docs/specs/v17_requirements_spec_v1.md`) based on the V17 architecture defined in `docs/architecture/architecture_v16.md`. This specification details functional requirements, mode interactions, `philosophy-kb-manager` API and internal logic, operational data schemas, and performance considerations, addressing the open questions from the architecture document.
- Acceptance criteria: 1. Document exists at `docs/specs/v17_requirements_spec_v1.md`. 2. Document accurately reflects V17 architecture. 3. Document addresses core principles, structure, interactions, `kb-manager` details (API, logic, schemas), and performance.
- Dependencies: `docs/architecture/architecture_v16.md` (V17 Design)
- Status: Draft
## Functional Requirements
### Feature: V18.3 Requirements Specification Document
- Added: 2025-05-02 21:50:39
- Description: Created the V18.3 requirements specification document (`docs/specs/v18_requirements_spec_v1.md`) based on the V18.3 architecture defined in `docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md`. This specification details functional requirements for rigor enhancements, direct KB access, direct operational context access, refined workflows (including failure handling and user interaction), KB Doctor maintenance tasks, and configuration updates. Matched V14 detail level. Includes pseudocode anchors for future implementation.
- Acceptance criteria: 1. Document exists at `docs/specs/v18_requirements_spec_v1.md`. 2. Document accurately reflects V18.3 architecture. 3. Document details requirements for rigor, direct access, workflows, KB Doctor, failure handling, and user interaction. 4. Detail level is comparable to `docs/specs/v14_requirements_spec_v1.md`.
- Dependencies: `docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md` (V18.3), `docs/specs/v14_requirements_spec_v1.md` (Reference)
- Status: Draft
### Feature: V13 Requirements Specification Document
- Added: 2025-05-02 02:55:24
- Description: Created the initial V13 requirements specification document based on `docs/architecture/architecture_v13.md`. Document includes specifications for the Philosophy Knowledge Base (KB), Philosophical Inquiry Workflow, System Self-Reflection Workflow, `philosophy-kb-manager` mode, `philosophy-meta-reflector` mode, and updates to existing modes.
- Acceptance criteria: 1. Document exists at `docs/specs/v13_requirements_spec_v1.md`. 2. Document accurately reflects V13 architecture. 3. Document covers specified components.
- Dependencies: `docs/architecture/architecture_v13.md`
- Status: Draft
