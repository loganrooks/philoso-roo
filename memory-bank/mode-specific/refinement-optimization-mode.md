### Optimization: [2025-05-07 01:09:50] - Refactor `scripts/process_source_text.py` for Modularity
- **Target**: `scripts/process_source_text.py`
- **Type**: Modularity/Readability
- **Desc**: Refactored the script to break down the main V1 architecture processing logic into smaller, single-responsibility functions. This involved creating a new `process_source_file` function to orchestrate the steps for a single input, and helper functions for argument parsing, directory creation, chunk generation, and index file writing. Unused legacy functions (`process_node_recursive`, `get_source_id`) were removed. The `main` function now calls `parse_arguments` and then `process_source_file`. Corrected double `main()` call.
- **Metrics Before**: Script length ~948 lines, large `main` function with mixed responsibilities.
- **Metrics After**: Script length ~603 lines, improved functional decomposition, clearer control flow.
- **Related Debt**: Addressed note about script length and modularity from previous update.
- **Related Issue**: Task to refactor `scripts/process_source_text.py`.
