# Architect Specific Memory
### Phase 1, Step 1: Review Existing Assets (Re-run) - [2025-05-01 13:38:00]
- **Description**: Re-ran the review of existing assets (`architectureV10.md`, actual `.clinerules` files in root) as per `philosophy_mode_improvement_plan.md`, based on corrected file information.
- **Findings**: Confirmed strengths (modularity, evidence linking, concept frameworks) and weaknesses (basic essay generation, missing citation generation/verification, lack of essay draft verification, no orchestrator, non-optimal memory for essay research) in V10 architecture and existing rules regarding enhancement goals.
- **Output**: Created `architecture_review_summary_v2.md` detailing the updated findings.
- **Status**: Ready for Phase 1, Step 2: Design New Architecture.

## Task Progress

### Phase 1, Step 1: Review Existing Assets - [2025-05-01 13:21:59]
- **Description**: Completed the review of existing assets (`architectureV10.md`, inferred modes) as per `philosophy_mode_improvement_plan.md`.
- **Findings**: Identified strengths (rigorous principles, modularity, evidence linking) and weaknesses (lack of dynamic evidence retrieval for essays, missing citation generation, insufficient verification in essay context, lack of orchestration, non-optimal memory structure for essays) in V10 architecture regarding essay writing, referencing, and verification.
- **Output**: Created `architecture_review_summary.md` detailing the findings.
- **Status**: Ready for Phase 1, Step 2: Design New Architecture.

### Plan: Hegel Philosophy Mode Enhancement - [2025-05-01 13:10:42]
- **Description**: Created a detailed task prompt and implementation plan (`philosophy_mode_improvement_plan.md`) for refactoring and enhancing the custom Hegel philosophy RooCode suite.
- **Focus**: Improving essay writing, reference accuracy, hallucination prevention, and memory management.
- **Key Elements**: Defined new architecture (`architecture_v11.md` to be created), new `philosophy-orchestrator` mode, refactoring steps for existing modes, new `.roo` structure for configuration, memory system design, and verification procedures.
- **Status**: Plan ready for handover to SPARC Orchestrator.
