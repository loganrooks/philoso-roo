### [2025-05-01 19:21:04] Intervention: Major New Requirements & Process Correction
- **Trigger**: User input after interruption and review of intermediate state.
- **Context**: Previous handover [2025-05-01 17:33:07] was flawed (context calc error, poor instructions). Intermediate instance proceeded with `.clinerules` planning/templating. User provided major new requirements for text processing and version control.
- **Action Taken**: Paused `.clinerules` corrective actions. Logged feedback/requirements across MB. Adjusted plan to prioritize documenting new requirements and revising architecture (V12) before resuming implementation. Will enforce correct context calculation (Tokens/1M = %) and delegation instructions.
- **Rationale**: Integrate major architectural changes systematically before detailed implementation. Correct process errors.
- **Outcome**: Plan adjusted. Workflow redirected to specification/architecture phase for new requirements.
- **Follow-up**: Delegate documentation task to Architect. Delegate architecture/plan revision to Architect. Review intermediate files (`clinerules_revision_plan_v1.md`, `clinerules_template_v1.md`) after architecture update.

## Workflow State (Current - Overwrite this section)
- Current phase: Specification/Architecture (Revision)
- Phase start: [2025-05-01 19:21:04]
- Current focus: Documenting and integrating new requirements (Text Processor mode, Version Control) into architecture and plan. Paused `.clinerules` implementation.
- Next actions: [Delegate documentation of new requirements to Architect]

## Intervention Log
### [2025-05-01 16:51:30] Intervention: Correct `.roomodes` format/location & `.clinerules` content/structure
- **Trigger**: User Feedback
### [2025-05-01 17:30:39] Task: Corrective Step 1.4 - Rewrite .roo/.roomodes
- Assigned to: code
- Description: Rewrite the `.roo/.roomodes` file, incorporating specific user feedback into placeholder instructions.
- Expected deliverable: Corrected configuration file at `.roo/.roomodes`.
- Status: completed
- Completion time: [2025-05-01 17:30:39]
- Outcome: Successfully created `.roo/.roomodes` with 10 philosophy modes, correct format, and feedback-informed placeholder instructions.
- Link to Progress Entry: [See Global Context Progress 2025-05-01 17:33:07]
- **Context**: Issues identified after Phase 3, Step 1 (`.roomodes` creation) and Phase 2 (`.clinerules` creation/refactoring). Specifically:
    - `.roo/.roomodes` file format incorrect (should follow root `./.roomodes` example).
    - Philosophy modes should be in *both* `.roo/.roomodes` (standalone) and added to root `./.roomodes`.
    - `.clinerules` files lack consistent structure suitable for philosophical tasks.
    - `.clinerules` files copied SPARC system rules too closely, not tailored for philosophy.
### [2025-05-01 19:34:03] Task: Revise Architecture & Plan (V12/V2)
- Assigned to: architect
- Description: Integrate new requirements (`new_requirements_spec_v1.md`) into `architecture_v11.md` and `philosophy_mode_improvement_plan.md`. Add review step for intermediate artifacts.
- Expected deliverable: `architecture_v12.md`, `philosophy_mode_improvement_plan_v2.md`
- Status: completed
- Completion time: [2025-05-01 19:34:03]
- Outcome: Successfully created `architecture_v12.md` and `philosophy_mode_improvement_plan_v2.md`.
- Link to Progress Entry: [See Global Context Progress: 2025-05-01 19:34:03]

## Workflow State (Current - Overwrite this section)
- Current phase: Phase 0 (Review Intermediate Artifacts)
- Phase start: [2025-05-01 19:34:03]
- Current focus: Preparing to execute Phase 0 of `philosophy_mode_improvement_plan_v2.md`.
- Next actions: [Read `philosophy_mode_improvement_plan_v2.md` to identify first step of Phase 0. Delegate Phase 0 task.]
- Last Updated: [2025-05-01 19:34:47]
### [2025-05-01 19:27:08] Task: Document New Requirements
- Assigned to: architect
- Description: Analyze user feedback [See Feedback: 2025-05-01 19:21:04] and `architecture_v11.md` to create a detailed specification document for the new `philosophy-text-processor` mode and version control integration.
- Expected deliverable: `new_requirements_spec_v1.md`
- Status: completed
- Completion time: [2025-05-01 19:27:08]
- Outcome: Successfully created `new_requirements_spec_v1.md`.
- Link to Progress Entry: [See Global Context Progress: 2025-05-01 19:27:08]

## Workflow State (Current - Overwrite this section)
- Current phase: Specification/Architecture (Revision)
- Phase start: [2025-05-01 19:21:04]
- Current focus: Integrating new requirements (`new_requirements_spec_v1.md`) into architecture (V12) and overall plan (V2).
- Next actions: [Delegate architecture (V12) and plan (V2) revision to Architect]
- Last Updated: [2025-05-01 19:27:39]
    - `.clinerules` files do not sufficiently leverage the new `philosophy-orchestrator` capabilities (e.g., `new_task`).
- **Action Taken**: Halted Phase 4 (Testing). Logged feedback in `memory-bank/feedback/sparc-feedback.md`. Adopted revised plan: 1) Correct `.roomodes` files. 2) Delegate `.clinerules` revision planning to Architect. 3) Resume Phase 4 later. Updated intervention log.
- **Rationale**: Ensure configuration files are correct and mode rules are fit-for-purpose and leverage new architecture before proceeding to testing. Addresses user concerns directly.
# Workflow State (Current - Overwrite this section)
- Current phase: Implementation (Corrective Actions)
- Phase start: [2025-05-01 16:57:41]
- Current focus: Completed Corrective Step 3.2.1 (Revise `philosophy-orchestrator.clinerules` content generation via Architect). Context high (54%). Handing over before writing file.
- Next actions: [Initiate handover via `new_task` to new SPARC instance. New instance to write content to `.roo/rules-philosophy-orchestrator/philosophy-orchestrator.clinerules`.]
