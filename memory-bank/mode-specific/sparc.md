## Intervention Log
### [2025-05-01 16:51:30] Intervention: Correct `.roomodes` format/location & `.clinerules` content/structure
- **Trigger**: User Feedback
### [2025-05-01 17:30:39] Task: Corrective Step 1.4 - Rewrite .roo/.roomodes
- Assigned to: code
- Description: Rewrite the `.roo/.roomodes` file, incorporating specific user feedback into placeholder instructions.
- Expected deliverable: Corrected configuration file at `.roo/.roomodes`.
- Status: completed
- Completion time: [2025-05-01 17:30:39]
- Outcome: Successfully created `.roo/.roomodes` with 10 philosophy modes, correct format, and feedback-informed placeholder instructions.
- Link to Progress Entry: [See Global Context Progress 2025-05-01 17:33:07]
- **Context**: Issues identified after Phase 3, Step 1 (`.roomodes` creation) and Phase 2 (`.clinerules` creation/refactoring). Specifically:
    - `.roo/.roomodes` file format incorrect (should follow root `./.roomodes` example).
    - Philosophy modes should be in *both* `.roo/.roomodes` (standalone) and added to root `./.roomodes`.
    - `.clinerules` files lack consistent structure suitable for philosophical tasks.
    - `.clinerules` files copied SPARC system rules too closely, not tailored for philosophy.
    - `.clinerules` files do not sufficiently leverage the new `philosophy-orchestrator` capabilities (e.g., `new_task`).
- **Action Taken**: Halted Phase 4 (Testing). Logged feedback in `memory-bank/feedback/sparc-feedback.md`. Adopted revised plan: 1) Correct `.roomodes` files. 2) Delegate `.clinerules` revision planning to Architect. 3) Resume Phase 4 later. Updated intervention log.
- **Rationale**: Ensure configuration files are correct and mode rules are fit-for-purpose and leverage new architecture before proceeding to testing. Addresses user concerns directly.
# Workflow State (Current - Overwrite this section)
- Current phase: Implementation (Corrective Actions)
- Phase start: [2025-05-01 16:57:41]
- Current focus: Handover due to critical context (123%) after completing Corrective Step 1.4. Next step is Corrective Step 2: Delegate `.clinerules` revision planning to Architect.
- Next actions: [Initiate handover via `new_task`]
- Last Updated: [2025-05-01 17:33:07]
- **Outcome**: Revised plan initiated. Proceeding with step 1: Read root `./.roomodes`.
- **Follow-up**: Monitor execution of corrective plan. Ensure Architect mode receives clear instructions for `.clinerules` revision planning. Verify corrected files before resuming Phase 4.
