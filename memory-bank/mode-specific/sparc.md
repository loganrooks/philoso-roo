<!-- Entries below should be added reverse chronologically (newest first) -->

### [2025-05-02 02:51:55] Intervention: V13 Implementation Prerequisites (Specs & Git Debt)
- **Trigger**: User Feedback denying `new_task` delegation (Git backup) [Timestamp: 2025-05-02 02:51:55]
- **Context**: Attempting to delegate V3 Plan Phase 0, Step 2 (Git backup).
- **Action Taken**: Halted Git backup task. Acknowledged user correction: Must first (1) Create updated V13 specifications based on `architecture_v13.md`, and (2) Resolve existing uncommitted changes ("Git debt") by analyzing, grouping (using logs), and committing them incrementally. Logged correction.
- **Rationale**: Ensuring necessary specification documents are in place and the repository is in a clean state before creating a V12 baseline tag/branch and starting V13 implementation. Addresses user concerns about process order and repository hygiene.
- **Outcome**: V3 Plan execution paused. Focus shifted to V13 spec creation and Git debt resolution.
- **Follow-up**: Update Workflow State. Delegate V13 spec creation task. Plan subsequent delegation for Git debt analysis and commit task.
### [2025-05-02 02:36:33] Intervention: Corrected V13 Design Deliverables (Plan Mandatory)
- **Trigger**: User Feedback denying `new_task` delegation [Timestamp: 2025-05-02 02:36:33]
- **Context**: Attempting to delegate V13 design task (Step 26). Delegation message incorrectly marked the updated plan (`philosophy_mode_improvement_plan_v3.md`) as an optional deliverable.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged user correction. Confirmed that both `docs/architecture/architecture_v13.md` and `docs/plans/philosophy_mode_improvement_plan_v3.md` are mandatory deliverables for the V13 design task. Logged correction.
- **Rationale**: Ensuring delegation instructions accurately reflect required outputs per user direction.
- **Outcome**: Delegation attempt aborted. Preparing to re-delegate with corrected, mandatory deliverables.
- **Follow-up**: Re-delegate V13 design task to Architect with both documents listed as mandatory deliverables.
### [2025-05-02 02:28:58] Intervention: Context Calculation Correction & Handover Override
- **Trigger**: User Input upon Task Resumption [Timestamp: 2025-05-02 02:28:58]
- **Context**: Resuming after interruption. Previous state incorrectly assessed context as critical (based on faulty system reporting) and planned mandatory handover.
- **Action Taken**: Received user correction: System context reporting is inaccurate; calculate manually as `Tokens / 1,000,000`. Current context recalculated to ~12%, well below threshold. Received explicit instruction: **NO HANDOVER**. Halted handover plan.
- **Rationale**: Adhering to user's direct instruction and correcting reliance on faulty system metrics for critical operations like handover. Ensuring accurate context assessment.
- **Outcome**: Handover cancelled. Proceeding with corrected V13 design delegation within the current instance. Context calculation method permanently adjusted per user instruction.
- **Follow-up**: Update Workflow State to remove handover mention. Delegate corrected V13 design task to Architect.
### [2025-05-02 00:51:03] Intervention: Corrected V13 "Questioning" Requirement Scope
- **Trigger**: User Input upon Task Resumption [Timestamp: 2025-05-02 00:51:03]
- **Context**: Resuming after interruption during V13 design delegation (Step 21). User corrected the interpretation of the "questioning" requirement.
- **Action Taken**: Halted previous V13 design delegation. Acknowledged user correction: "Questioning" encompasses two distinct concepts needing separate V13 modes/workflows: 1) Philosophical Inquiry (for essays/theses) and 2) System Self-Reflection/Self-Modification (linking to `architecture-questioning.md`, AI identity, versioning). Logged correction. Preparing for mandatory handover due to critical context (93%).
- **Rationale**: Aligning V13 design with clarified user requirements. Adhering to context management protocols (`DELEGATE CLAUSE`).
- **Outcome**: V13 design scope corrected. Previous delegation attempt invalidated. Handover imminent.
- **Follow-up**: Update Workflow State. Initiate handover to new SPARC instance with corrected V13 design delegation task for `architect`.
### [2025-05-01 23:10:20] Intervention: Major Plan Revision & New Requirements
- **Trigger**: User Input after Task Resumption [Timestamp: 2025-05-01 23:10:20]
- **Context**: Task resumed after 20 min interruption. Last action (delegation of handover fix to `code` mode via `new_task`) was not confirmed and assumed failed. User provided extensive feedback and new requirements.
- **Action Taken**: Halted previous plan (delegating handover fix). Logged user feedback comprehensively. Acknowledged points regarding testing mention, missed modes (`pre-lecture`, `secondary-lit`, `text-processor`) needing V12 updates + handover fix, new requirements (dedicated Philosophy KB, Questioning/Thesis workflow, self-modification capability), goal refinement (structured essays + original papers), and the critical need for documentation organization/versioning *before* V13 design. Adopted revised sequence: 1) Complete V12 updates (all modes + handover fix). 2) Organize documentation. 3) Design V13. 4) Implement V13.
- **Rationale**: Incorporating major user feedback and requirements, correcting scope omissions, and ensuring a structured approach by prioritizing documentation hygiene before further architectural changes.
- **Outcome**: Plan significantly revised. Focus shifted to completing V12 alignment across *all* relevant modes and organizing documentation. V13 design deferred.
- **Follow-up**: Update Workflow State. Delegate documentation organization task to Architect. Plan subsequent delegation for V12 updates (including handover fix) for all relevant modes.
### [2025-05-01 19:21:04] Intervention: Major New Requirements & Process Correction
### [2025-05-01 21:00:03] Intervention: Erroneous Handover Cascade & Feedback Integration Failure
- **Trigger**: User Feedback [Timestamp: 2025-05-01 21:00:03 approx] correcting previous SPARC actions.
- **Context**: SPARC instance incorrectly calculated context percentage (using 200k denominator), triggered premature handover below 40-50% threshold, and provided flawed handover instructions. This led to a cascade of further erroneous delegations ("broken telephone").
- **Action Taken**: Received and logged critical user feedback in full (`memory-bank/feedback/sparc-feedback.md`). Acknowledged errors: incorrect context math, premature handover, flawed instructions, feedback integration failure, lack of user confirmation for handover. Corrected understanding of context calculation (1M denominator) and handover protocol (user confirmation required). Reverting workflow state to manage rework within the current instance (or re-delegate correctly).
- **Rationale**: Correcting critical operational errors and ensuring adherence to user instructions and SPARC rules regarding context management and delegation.
- **Outcome**: Workflow reset to address `.clinerules` rework based on `clinerules_review_report_v1.md` under corrected protocols.
- **Follow-up**: Strictly adhere to 1M denominator for context calculation, 40-50% handover threshold, **user confirmation requirement for handover**, and provide comprehensive instructions in any future delegations. Monitor feedback integration. Re-initiate delegation for `.clinerules` rework.
- **Trigger**: User input after interruption and review of intermediate state.
- **Context**: Previous handover [2025-05-01 17:33:07] was flawed (context calc error, poor instructions). Intermediate instance proceeded with `.clinerules` planning/templating. User provided major new requirements for text processing and version control.
### [2025-05-01 20:43:24] Intervention: Faulty Handover Process (Premature & Insufficient)
- **Trigger**: User Report & Clarification [See Feedback Log: 2025-05-01 20:40:36, 2025-05-01 20:43:09].
- **Context**: Previous handover [See Feedback Log: 2025-05-01 19:54:45] was triggered prematurely (19% context) and lacked substantive context/initialization imperatives.
- **Action Taken**: Acknowledged dual failure points. Updated feedback log. Updated handover protocol (require substantive context, adhere to 40-50% threshold). Delegating review task to `architect`.
- **Rationale**: Correcting flawed orchestration process based on user feedback and SPARC principles. Ensuring robust context transfer is critical.
- **Outcome**: Handover protocol corrected. Review task delegation pending.
- **Follow-up**: Await `architect` review results before proceeding with main plan.
- **Action Taken**: Paused `.clinerules` corrective actions. Logged feedback/requirements across MB. Adjusted plan to prioritize documenting new requirements and revising architecture (V12) before resuming implementation. Will enforce correct context calculation (Tokens/1M = %) and delegation instructions.
- **Rationale**: Integrate major architectural changes systematically before detailed implementation. Correct process errors.
- **Outcome**: Plan adjusted. Workflow redirected to specification/architecture phase for new requirements.
- **Follow-up**: Delegate documentation task to Architect. Delegate architecture/plan revision to Architect. Review intermediate files (`clinerules_revision_plan_v1.md`, `clinerules_template_v1.md`) after architecture update.
