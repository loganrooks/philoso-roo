# TDD Mode Feedback

### [2025-05-07 03:35:00] - User Intervention: Test Strategy for `.clinerules`
- **Trigger**: User feedback on `execute_command` to set up test files, questioning the testing of internal Python mock logic instead of `.clinerules`.
- **Context**: Initial Python tests ([`tests/test_dynamic_roles_protocol.py`](tests/test_dynamic_roles_protocol.py:1)) were designed to mock mode interactions and file system calls to test the `dynamic_roles` update protocol.
- **Action**: Acknowledged user feedback. The current Python test setup tests Python mocks, not the `.clinerules` behavior directly. True `.clinerules` TDD would require simulating the Cline environment and tool calls, which is beyond the scope of a standard Python test.
- **Rationale**: User is correct; testing Python mocks doesn't validate `.clinerules`.
- **Outcome**: Revised test strategy. The Python tests will now serve as a *specification* for the *expected file system interactions and data transformations* that the `philosophy-orchestrator.clinerules` should perform when handling a `manage_dynamic_roles_update` request. The "Green" phase will involve proposing `.clinerules` changes to fulfill this contract.
- **Follow-up**: Proceed with Python tests under this revised strategy. The `execute_command` to create dummy files is still relevant for mocking file system interactions that the `.clinerules` would eventually perform.
### [2025-05-07 01:55:00] - Initial Test Suite for `process_source_text.py` Utilities
- **Trigger**: Task to create TDD tests.
- **Context**: Context grew to 51% during iterative test development for utility functions.
- **Action**: Successfully created and passed 70 unit tests for 10 utility/parsing functions. Made minor script adjustments for testability and to fix small bugs exposed by tests.
- **Rationale**: Following TDD (Red/Green/Refactor).
- **Outcome**: Stable set of initial tests.
- **Follow-up**: Handing over to new task for remaining functions due to context size. Suggest `new_task` to continue with `create_output_directories`.
