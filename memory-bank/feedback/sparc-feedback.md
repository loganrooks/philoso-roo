### [2025-05-01 19:21:04] User Intervention: Major New Requirements & Process Correction
- **Source**: User Input
- **Issue**:
    1.  **Context Calculation:** SPARC failed to manually calculate context % (Tokens / 1,000,000) and include it in delegations, leading to premature handover [2025-05-01 17:33:07].
    2.  **Flawed Handover:** The premature handover lacked proper initialization instructions, potentially causing the subsequent instance to operate without full context (e.g., not reading `architecture_v11.md`).
    3.  **Review Needed:** Work done by the intermediate instance(s) (approx. 17:33 - 17:49) needs review for potential errors due to lack of context. (Files potentially affected: `clinerules_revision_plan_v1.md`, `clinerules_template_v1.md`, generated orchestrator rules content).
    4.  **New Mode Req: `philosophy-text-processor`:** Need a new mode to recursively break down large Markdown source documents (books, lectures >20k tokens) into an indexed tree structure (max 20k tokens/leaf). Should use scripts/commands for splitting, handle formatting errors, and extract citation info. Structure should be generic (Level 0, Level 1, etc.) not tied to specific terms like "Chapter".
    5.  **New Req: Version Control:** System needs integration with version control.
    6.  **Documentation Req:** New requirements need detailed documentation, fleshing out details and considering integration.
- **Action**:
    1.  Acknowledged feedback and new requirements.
    2.  Logging intervention now across relevant MB files.
    3.  Will strictly adhere to manual context calculation (Tokens / 1,000,000 = %) and include in all delegations.
    4.  Adjusting plan: Pause `.clinerules` corrective actions. Prioritize documenting new requirements, revising architecture/plan, reviewing intermediate work, then resuming implementation.
- **Follow-up**: Delegate documentation of new requirements to Architect. Delegate architecture/plan revision to Architect. Review intermediate files (`clinerules_revision_plan_v1.md`, `clinerules_template_v1.md`) after architecture update.

### [2025-05-01 16:57:41] User Feedback on Phase 2/3 Outputs & Delegation
- **Source**: User Input
- **Issue**:
    1.  Delegation to `code` for rewriting `.roo/.roomodes` (Corrective Step 1.2) was denied due to insufficient detail incorporating prior feedback.
    2.  `.roomodes` file created in Phase 3, Step 1 was incorrectly formatted (should follow root `./.roomodes` JSON structure) and incorrectly located/scoped (should be a separate `.roo/.roomodes` for philosophy modes *and* these modes should be added to the root `./.roomodes`).
    3.  User Feedback: "I'm finding some issues with the way the .clinerules files have been written. They don't all share a similar high level format, and that worries me that they won't integrate well together."
    4.  User Feedback: "Furthermore, I said to take some inspiration from existing .clinerules files, not to basically copy and paste. The .clinerules files for the SPARC system in the .roo folder and their own subdirectory are for coding, not for doing philosophical research, and these things demand different things to be done rigorously and well. As such the .clinerules files for the different modes of the system should reflect that."
    5.  User Feedback: "The same goes for taking inspiration and building off of the preexisting .clinerules files for the philosophy research system. These were written before having access to an orchestrator mode that could create new subtasks. When we are rewriting the new versions we need to take advantage of what having an orchestrator mode as part of our system affords and it doesn't seem like we are very much."
    6.  SPARC failed to log this feedback in its own feedback file initially.
- **Action**:
    1.  Acknowledged feedback.
    2.  Logging feedback now.
    3.  Will update intervention log.
    4.  Will retry delegation for Corrective Step 1.2 with more detailed instructions reflecting feedback points 3-5 in the placeholder `customInstructions`.
    5.  Will proceed with Corrective Step 2 (delegating `.clinerules` revision planning to Architect).
