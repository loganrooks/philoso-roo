### [2025-05-01 2:00:29] Intervention: File Location Discrepancy
- **Trigger**: User input correcting file location.
- **Context**: `list_files` and `search_files` failed to find `.clinerules-philosophy-dialectical-analysis` in the root directory, contradicting task description and Memory Bank. User explicitly stated the file *is* present.
- **Action Taken**: Proceeding with the assumption the file exists at the root path (`.clinerules-philosophy-dialectical-analysis`) based on user confirmation, despite tool output.
- **Rationale**: User confirmation overrides tool output in this instance. Potential tool/filesystem inconsistency noted.
- **Outcome**: Attempting direct read of the file.
- **Follow-up**: Monitor for further file system inconsistencies.
