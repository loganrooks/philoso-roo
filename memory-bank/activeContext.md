[2025-05-07 14:51:53] - QATester - Test Plan Created: Created test plan for essay workflow stability in [`docs/testing/essay_workflow_stability_report_v1.md`](docs/testing/essay_workflow_stability_report_v1.md:1). Plan focuses on E2E scenarios for non-dated materials to assess impact of recent `.clinerules` changes.
[2025-05-07 14:43:35] - SPARC - CRITICAL Intervention: User Prioritizes Essay Writing Stability - All current development on "Dated Course Material Integration Plan" is paused. Focus is now on ensuring existing essay writing functionality is stable. This may involve assessing and potentially reverting recent `.clinerules` changes if they cause issues.
[2025-05-07 14:21:00] - TDD - Task: Continue TDD for `scripts/process_source_text.py` (Step 5.1 of integration plan). Status: Early Return Invoked. Persistent failures in `TestWriteMaterialIndexMd` tests due to YAML formatting (quoting, default fields). Context at 43%. See `memory-bank/feedback/tdd-feedback.md` [2025-05-07 14:21:00].
[2025-05-07 13:40:00] - Code - Task: Implement `.clinerules` changes for Dated Material &amp; AI Syllabus Integration - Completed. Created/Updated `.clinerules` for `philosophy-syllabus-processor`, `philosophy-text-processor`, `philosophy-pre-lecture`, `philosophy-class-analysis`, `philosophy-secondary-lit`, and `philosophy-orchestrator` as per [`docs/specs/clinerules_dated_syllabus_updates_v1.md`](docs/specs/clinerules_dated_syllabus_updates_v1.md:1).
[2025-05-07 13:11:00] - Architect - Task: Design `.clinerules` Modifications for Dated Material &amp; AI Syllabus Integration - Completed. Specification document created at `docs/specs/clinerules_dated_syllabus_updates_v1.md`.
[2025-05-07 12:26:25] - Architect - Task: Update Documentation for AI-Driven Syllabus Processing - Completed updates to [`docs/plans/dated_course_material_integration_plan_v1.md`](docs/plans/dated_course_material_integration_plan_v1.md:1), [`docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md`](docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md:1), and [`docs/proposals/syllabus_integration_architecture_v1.md`](docs/proposals/syllabus_integration_architecture_v1.md:1) to reflect that syllabus parsing will be AI-driven, not script-driven.
[2025-05-07 12:21:47] - SPARC - Intervention: Syllabus Processing Strategy Changed - User feedback indicates syllabus processing should be handled by an AI agent's internal logic, not a script, due to formatting variability. Previous delegation for script-based syllabus processing is invalid. Plan and architecture need revision.
[2025-05-07 12:18:00] - Code - Task: Integrate Syllabus Processing into `scripts/process_source_text.py` - Completed integration of syllabus processing framework into `scripts/process_source_text.py` as per Step 3.2 of [`docs/plans/dated_course_material_integration_plan_v1.md`](docs/plans/dated_course_material_integration_plan_v1.md:1). This includes CLI argument changes, metadata handling, ID/path generation for syllabuses, placeholder for detailed data extraction (`extract_syllabus_data`), generation of `extracted_data.json`, and updates to material, master, and course index functions. Placeholder `scripts/process_syllabus.py` was kept per user request.
[2025-05-07 09:11:19] - Code - Task: Update `scripts/process_source_text.py` for Dated Material Integration - Completed modifications to handle dated paths, extract date metadata, and include it in `master_index.json`, material `index.md` files, and stdout JSON output, per Step 3.1 of [`docs/plans/dated_course_material_integration_plan_v1.md`](docs/plans/dated_course_material_integration_plan_v1.md:120) and architectural documents ([`docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md`](docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md:1) V18.3.7, [`docs/proposals/source_material_architecture_v1.md`](docs/proposals/source_material_architecture_v1.md:1) Addendum V1.1).

[2025-05-07 08:54:55] - Architect - Planning Complete - Created plan for dated course material and workflow integration: [`docs/plans/dated_course_material_integration_plan_v1.md`](docs/plans/dated_course_material_integration_plan_v1.md:1).
[2025-05-07 08:45:00] - SPARC - User Intervention: Re-prioritize Tasks - User denied delegation for terminology fix. Instructed to first update overall architecture ([`docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md`](docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md:1)) and relevant `.clinerules` to incorporate syllabus integration ([`docs/proposals/syllabus_integration_architecture_v1.md`](docs/proposals/syllabus_integration_architecture_v1.md:1)) and define workflows for dated readings/lectures. Simplification requested: defer handling multiple versions of the same class for now. Previous task to address terminology inconsistency is paused.
[2025-05-07 08:45:00] - SPARC - USER INTERVENTION & TASK PIVOT: Enhance Course Material Workflows - User denied delegation for terminology fix. New priority: Update overall architecture ([`docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md`](docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md:1)) and `.clinerules` to integrate syllabus proposal ([`docs/proposals/syllabus_integration_architecture_v1.md`](docs/proposals/syllabus_integration_architecture_v1.md:1)) and define workflows for dated readings/lectures, including their storage, date handling, and associations. Simplify by deferring multiple class versions. Task to address terminology inconsistency is paused. Next: Plan and delegate architectural updates for new course material workflows.
[2025-05-07 08:09:00] - SPARC - Syllabus Architecture Proposal Complete - `architect` mode completed investigation and created proposal document [`docs/proposals/syllabus_integration_architecture_v1.md`](docs/proposals/syllabus_integration_architecture_v1.md:1) for syllabus integration. Next: Update Memory Bank and proceed with holistic review items.
[2025-05-07 07:57:00] - SPARC - New Instance Takeover &amp; Source Material Architecture Investigation - New SPARC instance initialized. Memory Bank loaded. Prioritizing investigation of `source_materials/` architecture for syllabuses as per handover instructions. Preparing delegation to `architect` mode.
[2025-05-07 08:05:23] - Architect - Syllabus integration architecture proposal created at [`docs/proposals/syllabus_integration_architecture_v1.md`](docs/proposals/syllabus_integration_architecture_v1.md:1). Investigation complete.

User instructed to skip purging "SPARC" from Memory Bank files for now. Next step: Address holistic review items. Context at ~41.68%, preparing for handover.
[2025-05-07 05:49:36] - Code - "SPARC" Purge from Config/Code - Reviewed and updated all `.clinerules` files in `.roo/rules-*/` and the root `.roomodes` file to remove mentions of "SPARC", replacing them with "Philoso-Roo System" or "the system". Python files in `scripts/` and `tests/` were searched, but no instances were found.
[2025-05-07 05:05:36] - DocsWriter - "SPARC" Purge from Documentation - Reviewed and updated all `.md` files in `docs/` and the root `README.md` to remove mentions of "SPARC", replacing them with "Philoso-Roo System", "the system", "operational memory", or similar appropriate phrasing. Ensured documentation reads naturally and presents "Philoso-Roo" as a distinct entity.
[2025-05-07 04:48:42] - DocsWriter - User Guide Created - Created new user guide `docs/guides/user_guide_material_processing_workflows.md` covering raw material preparation, `source_materials/raw/` directory structure, and system workflow user stories. Based on review of `docs/proposals/source_material_architecture_v1.md`, `scripts/process_source_text.py`, `README.md`, and Memory Bank.
[2025-05-07 04:38:53] - SPARC - User Intervention: Task Pivot - User provided new instructions, superseding sequential processing of holistic review items. New priorities: 1) Create user-facing documentation for raw material processing workflow and general system usage, including `source_materials/raw/` organization. 2) Purge all "SPARC" system mentions from the philoso-roo project. Holistic review finding on empty `customInstructions` in `.roomodes` is to be disregarded.
[2025-05-07 04:22:01] - DocsWriter - Created root `README.md` - Drafted and created the main `README.md` file for the Philoso-Roo project, incorporating information from holistic review, architecture documents, and other key project files. Addresses high-priority finding from [`docs/reviews/holistic_review_v1.md`](docs/reviews/holistic_review_v1.md:1).
[2025-05-07 04:18:31] - SPARC - Initial Holistic Workspace Review Complete - `holistic-reviewer` mode completed its initial scan and produced [`docs/reviews/holistic_review_v1.md`](docs/reviews/holistic_review_v1.md:1) with findings and recommendations.
