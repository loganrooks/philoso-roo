Added/updated sections addressing Memory Bank pattern (Sec 10), RooCode Checkpoints (Sec 8.1), and Versioning Strategy (Sec 8) per evaluation report recommendations (Rec 3.5, 3.8, 3.14).
[2025-05-05 08:21:39] - Architect - Diagram Update Completed - Updated Mermaid diagram in `docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md` (Section 5) via `apply_diff` to reflect V18.3.4 architecture (removed KB Doctor, added distributed maintenance links). Task complete.
[2025-05-05 06:56:04] - Architect - Architecture &amp; Standards Review Completed - Reviewed architecture_v18.md (v18.3.4) against evaluation report v7; identified gaps (diagram, MB/Checkpoint/Versioning docs). Evaluated clinerules_standard_v1.md; proposed enhancements in docs/proposals/clinerules_standard_enhancements_v1.md addressing MCP, KB interaction, coordination, inheritance, batching. Ready for completion.
[2025-05-05 06:40:02] - SPARC - Handover Received (Architect Early Return - High Context) - Received Early Return from Architect mode [See SPARC MB Delegation Log: 2025-05-05 05:49:54]. Architect created integration plan (`docs/plans/v18_integration_plan_v1.md`) and executed steps 1-6 (updating arch to v18.3.4, creating MCP blueprint, testing docs, updating some rules). Handover triggered due to high context (57%) and user denial of further delegation in that instance. Preparing handover to new Architect instance for review tasks.
[2025-05-05 06:27:12] - Code - Early Return Triggered (High Context & User Pivot) - Context at 57%. User denied `new_task` delegation for Step 7 (`.clinerules` updates). User instructed handover to new `architect` instance to: 1) Ensure `docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md` fully integrates evaluation feedback. 2) Evaluate `docs/standards/clinerules_standard_v1.md` against updated architecture. Integration plan execution paused. See feedback log [2025-05-05 06:26:53].
[2025-05-05 06:15:22] - Code - Task Update - Completed Step 6 (Strengthen Distributed Maintenance) of integration plan.

[2025-05-05 06:06:37] - Architect - Task Update - Completed Step 2 (MCP Strategy) of integration plan. Created `docs/blueprints/mcp_integration_v1.md` defining Distributed Call strategy. Updated `docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md` (v18.3.4) to summarize strategy and reference blueprint. Proceeding to Step 3 (Testing Strategy).
[2025-05-05 06:02:50] - Architect - Task Update - Verified Step 1 (Correct Diagram) of integration plan (`docs/plans/v18_integration_plan_v1.md`).
