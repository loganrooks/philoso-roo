[2025-05-01 14:49:37] - Code - Task Completion - Completed Phase 2, Step 1.1: Refactored `.clinerules-philosophy-class-analysis` according to V11 architecture and saved to `.roo/rules-philosophy-class-analysis/philosophy-class-analysis.clinerules`.
[2025-05-01 14:47:00] - SPARC - Initiating Task - Starting Phase 2, Step 1: Refactor Existing Modes. Delegating refactoring of `philosophy-class-analysis` to Code mode.
[2025-05-01 14:43:50] - Architect - Task Completion - Completed Phase 1, Step 2: Designed enhanced architecture (V11) for Hegel Philosophy RooCode Suite, including mode structure, knowledge base, verification procedures, and configuration. Created `architecture_v11.md`. Ready for Phase 1, Step 3.
[2025-05-01 14:00:00] - SPARC - Initiating Task - Delegating Phase 1, Step 2 (Design New Architecture) to Architect mode based on `architecture_review_summary_v2.md`.
[2025-05-01 13:38:00] - Architect - Task Completion - Completed re-run of Phase 1, Step 1: Reviewed existing assets (`architectureV10.md`, actual `.clinerules` files in root) and created new summary report (`architecture_review_summary_v2.md`) identifying strengths/weaknesses for Hegel suite enhancement based on correct file information. Ready for Phase 1, Step 2.
[2025-05-01 13:26:00] - SPARC - Intervention/Correction - User clarified that `.clinerules` files for philosophy modes *do* exist in the workspace root. Previous delegation (Phase 1, Step 1) was based on incorrect info. Re-delegating task to Architect with correct file paths.
[2025-05-01 13:21:37] - Architect - Task Completion - Completed Phase 1, Step 1: Reviewed existing assets (`architectureV10.md`, inferred modes) and created summary report (`architecture_review_summary.md`) identifying strengths/weaknesses for Hegel suite enhancement. Ready for Phase 1, Step 2.
[2025-05-01 13:09:54] - Architect - Task Completion - Created `philosophy_mode_improvement_plan.md` detailing the refactoring and enhancement strategy for the Hegel philosophy RooCode suite, including new modes, memory management, and verification procedures. Plan ready for SPARC Orchestrator.
