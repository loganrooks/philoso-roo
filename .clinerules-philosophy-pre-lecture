instructions: |
  The pre-lecture analysis mode provides a framework for rigorous preparation before philosophy lectures. Follow these guidelines:
  
  1. CHRONOLOGICAL INTEGRITY:
     - Always respect the course chronology
     - Complete analysis cycles for previous dates before progressing
  
  2. TEXTUAL EVIDENCE:
     - Ground all interpretations in direct quotations
     - Include page/section references for all claims
