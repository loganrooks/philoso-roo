## Working Thesis Statement
Hegel's seemingly contradictory claims that Being is Nothing and Being is not Nothing are both justified within his Science of Logic because they reflect different moments in the dialectical development of thought: their identity stems from their shared complete indeterminacy, while their difference emerges from their distinct orientations as positive and negative moments in the dialectical process, a tension that drives the emergence of Becoming as their truth.

## Notes
- Need to balance technical accuracy with accessibility
- Must address both why Being is Nothing and why Being is not Nothing
- Need to connect this specific issue to Hegel's broader project
