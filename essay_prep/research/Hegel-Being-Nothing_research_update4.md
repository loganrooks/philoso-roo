# Research Update 4: Hegel's Science of Logic pp. 59-82 (Being, Nothing, and Becoming)

## Key Insights for Understanding Being and Nothing

### 1. The Nature of Pure Being

> "Being, pure being – without further determination. In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself and also not unequal with respect to another; it has no difference within it, nor any outwardly. If any determination or content were posited in it as distinct, or if it were posited by this determination or content as distinct from an other, it would thereby fail to hold fast to its purity. It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness. – There is nothing to be intuited in it, if one can speak here of intuiting; or, it is only this pure empty intuiting itself. Just as little is anything to be thought in it, or, it is equally only this empty thinking. Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact nothing, and neither more nor less than nothing." (p. 59)

**Positive Determination:** Pure being is indeterminate immediacy, equal only to itself, with no difference within it or outwardly. It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness, empty intuiting and empty thinking.

**Negative Determination:** Pure being is not determinate, not mediated, not unequal with respect to another, not different from itself, not distinct from anything else. It is not something that can be intuited or thought in the ordinary sense.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This passage directly states that "Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact nothing, and neither more nor less than nothing." This is Hegel's explicit claim that Being is Nothing, which is the first part of our question. The reason for this identity is that both Being and Nothing are completely indeterminate and empty.

### 2. The Nature of Pure Nothing

> "Nothing, pure nothingness; it is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, complete absence of determination and content; lack of all distinction within. – In so far as mention can be made here of intuiting and thinking, it makes a difference whether something or nothing is being intuited or thought. To intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning; the two are distinguished and so nothing is (concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather it is the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being." (p. 59)

**Positive Determination:** Pure nothing is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, complete absence of determination and content, lack of all distinction within. It is the empty intuiting and thinking itself.

**Negative Determination:** Nothing is not something determinate, not something with content, not something with distinction within it. It is not something that can be intuited or thought in the ordinary sense.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This passage shows that Nothing has the same characteristics as Being: both are completely indeterminate and empty. This explains why Being is Nothing. The passage also states that Nothing is "the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being," explicitly drawing the parallel between the two.

### 3. The Identity of Being and Nothing

> "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same." (p. 59)

**Positive Determination:** Being and nothing are the same because both are completely indeterminate and empty.

**Negative Determination:** The identity of being and nothing is not a result of external comparison but is inherent in their nature.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This is Hegel's explicit claim that Being and Nothing are the same, which directly addresses the first part of our question. The reason for this identity is that both are completely indeterminate and empty.

### 4. The Difference Between Being and Nothing

> "But the truth is just as much that they are not without distinction; it is rather that they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable, and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite." (p. 59-60)

**Positive Determination:** Being and nothing are absolutely distinct, yet equally unseparated and inseparable. Each immediately vanishes in its opposite.

**Negative Determination:** The distinction between being and nothing is not a fixed, static opposition but a dynamic movement. They are not separate or separable from each other.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This passage directly addresses the second part of our question, explaining why Being is not Nothing. Despite their identity in terms of content (or lack thereof), they are "absolutely distinct" in terms of their orientation or perspective. This distinction, however, is not static but dynamic, as "each immediately vanishes in its opposite."

### 5. The Unity of Being and Nothing in Becoming

> "Their truth is therefore this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming, a movement in which the two are distinguished, but by a distinction which has just as immediately dissolved itself." (p. 60)

**Positive Determination:** The truth of being and nothing is becoming, which is the movement of the immediate vanishing of one into the other. In becoming, being and nothing are distinguished, but this distinction immediately dissolves itself.

**Negative Determination:** The truth of being and nothing is not found in either one taken in isolation, nor in their static identity, but in their dynamic movement into each other.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This passage explains how the contradiction between the identity and difference of Being and Nothing is resolved in Becoming. Becoming is the unity of Being and Nothing, the movement in which they are both distinguished and united.

### 6. The Dialectical Nature of Being and Nothing

> "The dialectical immanent nature of being and nothing themselves [is] to manifest their unity, which is becoming, as their truth." (p. 82)

**Positive Determination:** Being and nothing have a dialectical immanent nature that manifests their unity, which is becoming, as their truth.

**Negative Determination:** The unity of being and nothing is not imposed from outside but emerges from their own dialectical nature.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This passage emphasizes that the movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming is not an external reflection but is inherent in the nature of Being and Nothing themselves. This supports our thesis that the contradiction between Being and Nothing is not a logical error but a necessary moment in the self-development of thought.

### 7. The Moments of Becoming

> "Becoming is in this way doubly determined. In one determination, nothing is the immediate, that is, the determination begins with nothing and this refers to being; that is to say, it passes over into it. In the other determination, being is the immediate, that is, the determination begins with being and this passes over into nothing – coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be." (p. 60)

**Positive Determination:** Becoming is doubly determined as coming-to-be (nothing passing over into being) and ceasing-to-be (being passing over into nothing).

**Negative Determination:** Becoming is not a simple, one-sided movement but a double movement that contains both coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This passage explains the internal structure of Becoming as the unity of Being and Nothing. It shows that Becoming is not a simple synthesis but a complex unity that contains both the movement from Nothing to Being (coming-to-be) and the movement from Being to Nothing (ceasing-to-be).

### 8. The Sublation of Becoming

> "The equilibrium in which coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be are poised is in the first place becoming itself. But this becoming equally collects itself in quiescent unity. Being and nothing are in it only as vanishing; becoming itself, however, is only by virtue of their being distinguished. Their vanishing is therefore the vanishing of becoming, or the vanishing of the vanishing itself." (p. 81)

**Positive Determination:** Becoming is the equilibrium in which coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be are poised. But becoming itself vanishes into a quiescent unity, which is existence (Dasein).

**Negative Determination:** Becoming is not a stable, permanent category but itself passes over into a higher category.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This passage shows that the dialectical movement does not stop with Becoming but continues to higher categories. This helps us understand the role of the Being-Nothing-Becoming triad in the larger project of the Logic.

### 9. The Meaning of Sublation

> "To sublate and being sublated (the idealized) constitute one of the most important concepts of philosophy. It is a fundamental determination that repeatedly occurs everywhere in it, the meaning of which must be grasped with precision and especially distinguished from nothing. – What is sublated does not thereby turn into nothing. Nothing is the immediate; something sublated is on the contrary something mediated; it is something non-existent but as a result that has proceeded from a being; it still has in itself, therefore, the determinateness from which it derives." (p. 81)

**Positive Determination:** Sublation (Aufheben) means both to preserve and to negate. What is sublated is not annihilated but preserved in a higher form.

**Negative Determination:** Sublation is not mere negation or annihilation. It is not a return to nothing but a transition to a higher category.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This passage explains the concept of sublation, which is crucial for understanding how the contradiction between Being and Nothing is resolved in Becoming. The contradiction is not simply negated but preserved and elevated to a higher level.

### 10. The Relationship Between Being, Nothing, and Becoming in the Larger Project

> "All further logical determinations besides becoming itself (existence, quality, and in general all the concepts of philosophy) are therefore examples of this unity [of being and nothing]." (p. 60)

**Positive Determination:** All further logical determinations are examples of the unity of being and nothing. The pattern established in the first triad (Being-Nothing-Becoming) is repeated throughout the Logic.

**Negative Determination:** The first triad is not an isolated instance but a pattern that recurs throughout the Logic.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This passage helps us understand the role of the Being-Nothing-Becoming triad in the larger project of the Logic. It is not just the beginning but the pattern for the entire dialectical development.

## Implications for Our Essay

These insights from the Science of Logic pp. 59-82 provide crucial evidence for understanding Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing. They help us address several key requirements of the essay:

1. **Explaining why Being is Nothing**: Being and Nothing are the same because both are completely indeterminate and empty. They have no content or determination that would distinguish them from each other.

2. **Explaining why Being is not Nothing**: Despite their identity in terms of content (or lack thereof), Being and Nothing are "absolutely distinct" in terms of their orientation or perspective. Being is the positive attempt to think pure indeterminacy, while Nothing is the negative recognition of the failure of this attempt.

3. **Understanding how Hegel "gets from" Being to Nothing**: The attempt to think pure Being fails because there is nothing determinate to think. This failure is Nothing. Thus, Being passes over into Nothing through its own internal dialectic.

4. **Understanding the role of this contradiction in the larger project**: The contradiction between Being and Nothing is resolved in Becoming, which is their truth. This pattern of contradiction and resolution is repeated throughout the Logic, making the first triad the paradigm for the entire dialectical development.

5. **Connecting to Hegel's broader philosophical system**: The dialectical movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming exemplifies Hegel's method of immanent development, in which categories develop through their own internal contradictions rather than through external comparison or reflection.

These insights, combined with our previous research on the Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences and the Science of Logic pp. 23-48, provide a solid foundation for our essay on Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing.
