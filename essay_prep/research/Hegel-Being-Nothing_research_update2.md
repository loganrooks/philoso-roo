# Research Update 2: Hegel's Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences §§19-25 and Phenomenology of Spirit (Absolute Knowing)

## Key Insights from Encyclopedia §§19-25: Science of Logic

### 1. The Nature of Logic

> "Logic is the science of the pure idea, i.e. the idea in the abstract element of thinking." (§19)

**Positive Determination:** Logic is the science of the pure idea in the abstract element of thinking. It deals with pure abstractions rather than intuitions or sensory representations.

**Negative Determination:** Logic is not a science of empirical objects or sensory intuitions. It is not merely a formal tool for organizing thoughts but is concerned with the content of thought itself.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This helps us understand the status of Being and Nothing as pure thought-determinations in the abstract element of thinking. They are not empirical concepts derived from experience but pure abstractions that constitute the beginning of the logical system.

### 2. The Difficulty and Simplicity of Logic

> "Logic is the most difficult science in that it has to do not with intuitions – and not even with abstract sensory representations as in geometry – but with pure abstractions. It requires a certain strength and versatility to retreat into pure thought, to hold on to it steadfastly and to move about in it. On the other hand, logic could be considered the easiest science, because its content is nothing but one's own thinking and its familiar determinations, and these are at once the simplest and the elementary sort of determinations. They are also what is most familiar, namely being, nothing, etc., determinateness, magnitude, etc., being-in-itself, being-for-itself, one, many, etc." (§19)

**Positive Determination:** Logic is both the most difficult science (because it deals with pure abstractions) and the easiest (because it deals with our own thinking and its familiar determinations).

**Negative Determination:** The difficulty of logic is not due to the complexity of its content but to the challenge of retreating into pure thought and holding onto it steadfastly.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This explains why Being and Nothing, despite being the simplest and most familiar determinations, are also the most difficult to grasp. Their simplicity and abstraction make them elusive, which is why they can appear to be both identical and distinct.

### 3. The Objective Nature of Thought

> "When we speak of thinking, it appears initially to be a subjective activity, one of several faculties possessed by us, such as memory, representation, volition, and the like. If thinking were a merely subjective activity and as such the object of logic, this science like any other would have its specific object. [...] To become familiar with thinking even as a merely subjective activity is not without interest. [...] But our thinking is very concrete, but with respect to its manifold content we need to sort out what belongs to thinking or the abstract form of the activity." (§20, Addition)

**Positive Determination:** Thinking is not merely a subjective activity but has an objective dimension. Logic deals with the abstract form of thinking, which is universal and not merely subjective.

**Negative Determination:** Logic is not concerned with the psychological aspects of thinking or with thinking as a merely subjective activity.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This helps us understand that Being and Nothing are not merely subjective concepts but have an objective status as thought-determinations. They are not arbitrary or contingent but necessary moments in the development of thought.

### 4. The Relationship Between Logic and Metaphysics

> "The expression 'objective thoughts' signifies the truth, which is to be the absolute object, not merely the goal of philosophy. [...] The logical dimension [das Logische] constitutes the absolute form of the truth and even more than that, the pure truth itself." (§25)

**Positive Determination:** Logic deals with "objective thoughts" that constitute the truth itself, not merely the goal of philosophy. The logical dimension is the absolute form of truth.

**Negative Determination:** Logic is not merely a formal discipline or a means to an end but is itself the science of truth.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This helps us understand the significance of the logical categories, including Being and Nothing, as constituting the truth itself. They are not merely formal categories but have metaphysical significance.

### 5. The Finitude of Understanding vs. the Infinity of Reason

> "If a fixed opposition attaches to the thought-determinations, i.e. if they are of a merely finite nature, then they are unfit for the truth that is absolutely in and for itself, and the truth cannot then enter into thinking. Thinking that produces only finite determinations and moves among them is called understanding (in the more precise sense of the word)." (§25)

**Positive Determination:** Understanding (Verstand) produces only finite determinations and moves among them, while reason (Vernunft) grasps the infinite and the truth that is absolutely in and for itself.

**Negative Determination:** Understanding is limited by fixed oppositions and cannot grasp the truth that is absolutely in and for itself.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This helps explain why understanding sees Being and Nothing as fixed opposites that exclude each other, while reason grasps their identity and difference as moments in a dialectical movement. The contradiction between Being and Nothing is resolved in the movement of reason, not in the fixed determinations of understanding.

### 6. The Meaning of Truth in Logic

> "In the philosophical sense, by contrast, truth means in general the agreement of a content with itself, to put it abstractly. [...] God alone is the true agreement of the concept with reality. But all finite things have an untruth: they possess a concept and a concrete existence that is, however, inadequate to the concept." (§24, Addition 3)

**Positive Determination:** Truth in the philosophical sense means the agreement of a content with itself, not the agreement of a representation with an external object.

**Negative Determination:** Truth is not merely correctness or the correspondence of a representation with an external object.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This helps us understand that the truth of Being and Nothing lies in their dialectical relationship, not in their isolated determinations. Their truth is Becoming, which is the agreement of their content with itself through the movement of thought.

## Key Insights from Phenomenology of Spirit: Absolute Knowing

### 1. The Unity of Self-Consciousness and Objectivity

> "The Spirit of the revealed religion has not yet surmounted its consciousness as such, or what is the same, its actual self-consciousness is not the object of its consciousness; Spirit itself as a whole, and the self-differentiated moments within it, fall within the sphere of picture-thinking and in the form of objectivity. [...] This surmounting of the object of consciousness is not to be taken one-sidedly to mean that the object showed itself as returning into the Self, but is to be taken more specifically to mean not only that the object as such presented itself to the Self as vanishing, but rather that it is the externalization of self-consciousness that posits the thinghood [of the object] and that this externalization has not merely a negative but a positive meaning, a meaning which is not only for us or in itself, but for self-consciousness itself." (§788)

**Positive Determination:** In Absolute Knowing, self-consciousness recognizes that the object is not something external and alien but is its own externalization. The object's vanishing is not merely negative but has a positive meaning for self-consciousness.

**Negative Determination:** Absolute Knowing is not the mere negation of objectivity or the retreat into pure subjectivity, but the recognition of the unity of self-consciousness and objectivity.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This helps us understand that Being and Nothing are not merely abstract categories but moments in the self-externalization of Spirit. Their identity and difference are aspects of Spirit's self-relation in its otherness.

### 2. The Dialectical Movement of Spirit

> "The negative of the object, or its self-supersession, has a positive meaning for self-consciousness, i.e. self-consciousness knows the nothingness of the object, on the one hand, because it externalizes its own self—for in this externalization it posits itself as object, or the object as itself, in virtue of the indivisible unity of being-for-self. On the other hand, this positing at the same time contains the other moment, viz. that self-consciousness has equally superseded this externalization and objectivity too, and taken it back into itself so that it is in communion with itself in its otherness as such." (§788)

**Positive Determination:** The dialectical movement of Spirit involves both the externalization of self-consciousness (positing itself as object) and the supersession of this externalization (taking the object back into itself).

**Negative Determination:** This movement is not a linear progression from one state to another but a circular movement in which Spirit returns to itself through its otherness.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This helps us understand the dialectical movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming as a moment in the self-development of Spirit. Being externalizes itself into Nothing, and this externalization is superseded in Becoming, which is the unity of Being and Nothing.

### 3. The Role of Contradiction in Spirit's Self-Development

> "The last of these moments is, however, necessarily this unity itself and, as is evident, it binds them all into itself. The Spirit that, in its existence, is certain of itself, has for the element of existence nothing else but this knowledge of itself; when it declares that what it does it does out of a conviction of duty, this utterance is the validating of its action. Action is the first implicit sundering of the simple unity of the Notion and the return out of this dividedness." (§793)

**Positive Determination:** Spirit's self-development involves the sundering of its simple unity and the return from this dividedness. This movement is necessary for Spirit to become what it is.

**Negative Determination:** Spirit's self-development is not a static identity but a dynamic process that involves contradiction and its resolution.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This helps us understand that the contradiction between Being and Nothing is not a logical error but a necessary moment in the self-development of Spirit. The resolution of this contradiction in Becoming is the return from dividedness to unity.

### 4. The Relationship Between Time and the Notion

> "Time is the Notion itself that is there and which presents itself to consciousness as empty intuition; for this reason, Spirit necessarily appears in Time, and it appears in Time just so long as it has not grasped its pure Notion, i.e. has not annulled Time. It is the outer, intuited pure Self which is not grasped by the Self, the merely intuited Notion; when this latter grasps itself it sets aside its Time-form, comprehends this intuiting, and is a comprehended and comprehending intuiting." (§801)

**Positive Determination:** Time is the Notion itself that is there and presents itself to consciousness as empty intuition. Spirit appears in Time until it grasps its pure Notion.

**Negative Determination:** Time is not something external to Spirit but is the form of its self-externalization. The annulment of Time is not its disappearance but its comprehension by Spirit.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This helps us understand the relationship between the logical categories (Being, Nothing, Becoming) and their temporal manifestation. Being and Nothing are not temporal categories, but their dialectical movement in Becoming has a temporal aspect as the self-externalization of Spirit.

### 5. The Relationship Between Science and History

> "For this reason it must be said that nothing is known that is not in experience, or, as it is also expressed, that is not felt to be true, not given as an inwardly revealed eternal verity, as something sacred that is believed, or whatever other expressions have been used. For experience is just this, that the content—which is Spirit—is in itself substance, and therefore an object of consciousness. But this substance which is Spirit is the process in which Spirit becomes what it is in itself; and it is only as this process of reflecting itself into itself that it is in itself truly Spirit." (§802)

**Positive Determination:** Spirit becomes what it is in itself through the process of reflecting itself into itself. This process is experience, in which Spirit is both substance and object of consciousness.

**Negative Determination:** Spirit is not a static entity but a process of self-becoming. It is not something given in advance but something that emerges through its own self-development.

**Relevance to Thesis:** This helps us understand that the logical categories, including Being and Nothing, are not static entities but moments in the self-development of Spirit. Their truth lies not in their isolated determinations but in their dialectical movement, which is the process of Spirit becoming what it is in itself.

## Implications for Our Essay

These insights from the Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences §§19-25 and the Phenomenology of Spirit (Absolute Knowing) provide crucial context for understanding Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing in the Science of Logic. They help us address several key requirements of the essay:

1. **Situating Hegel's claims within his project in the Science of Logic**: The Logic is the science of the pure idea in the abstract element of thinking. It deals with "objective thoughts" that constitute the truth itself, not merely the goal of philosophy.

2. **Explaining why Hegel is entitled to start with Being**: Being is the simplest and most familiar determination of thought, yet also the most abstract and difficult to grasp. It is the beginning of the logical system because it is the most immediate and indeterminate category.

3. **Clarifying the ontological status of Being and Nothing**: Being and Nothing are not merely subjective concepts but have an objective status as thought-determinations. They are moments in the self-externalization of Spirit.

4. **Understanding the role of contradiction**: The contradiction between Being and Nothing is not a logical error but a necessary moment in the self-development of Spirit. It is resolved in Becoming, which is the unity of Being and Nothing.

5. **Connecting to Hegel's broader project**: The dialectical movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming is a moment in the self-development of Spirit, which becomes what it is in itself through the process of reflecting itself into itself.

Next, I will examine the Science of Logic pp. 23-48 to get more specific insights about the beginning of the Logic and the methodological principles that govern it.
