# Hegel's Claims About Being and Nothing

## Section 7: The Role of the Being-Nothing-Becoming Triad in the Logic

Having examined the resolution of the contradiction between Being and Nothing in Becoming, and the transition from Becoming to Existence, we can now address the role of this first triad in the larger project of the Logic. This will help us understand why Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing are not merely logical puzzles but reveal something fundamental about the nature of thought and reality.

### The First Triad as Paradigm

The Being-Nothing-Becoming triad is not just the beginning of the Logic but serves as a paradigm for the entire dialectical development. Hegel makes this point explicitly: "All further logical determinations besides becoming itself (existence, quality, and in general all the concepts of philosophy) are therefore examples of this unity [of being and nothing]" (60). This means that the pattern established in the first triad—the identity and difference of opposites, their resolution in a higher category, and the transition to a new opposition—is repeated throughout the Logic.

This paradigmatic role is evident in the transition from Becoming to Existence. Just as Being and Nothing are opposites that are both identical and distinct, and are resolved in Becoming, so too are coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be opposites that are both identical and distinct, and are resolved in Existence. This pattern continues throughout the Logic, with each new category giving rise to its opposite, and the contradiction between them being resolved in a higher category.

The first triad thus provides the basic structure of dialectical development that characterizes the entire Logic. It shows how thought moves from one category to another through the immanent development of contradictions, rather than through external reflection or comparison.

### The Necessity of Contradiction

The Being-Nothing-Becoming triad also reveals the necessity of contradiction in Hegel's dialectical method. For Hegel, contradiction is not a sign of error but a necessary moment in the self-development of thought. The contradiction between the identity and difference of Being and Nothing is not a problem to be solved but a dynamic tension that drives the dialectical movement forward.

This necessity of contradiction is emphasized by Hegel in the Encyclopedia: "Contradiction is the very moving principle of the world: and it is ridiculous to say that contradiction is unthinkable. The only thing correct in that statement is that contradiction is not the end of the matter, but cancels itself. But contradiction, when cancelled, does not leave abstract identity; for that is itself only one side of the contrariety. The proximate result of opposition (when realized as contradiction) is the Ground, which contains identity as well as difference superseded and deposited to elements in the complete notion" (Encyclopedia §119, Addition 2).

This passage suggests that contradiction is not merely a subjective error in our thinking but an objective feature of reality itself. The contradiction between Being and Nothing is not just a logical puzzle but reveals something fundamental about the nature of thought and reality.

### The Immanent Development of Categories

The Being-Nothing-Becoming triad also illustrates the immanent development of categories in Hegel's Logic. The transition from Being to Nothing, and from Being and Nothing to Becoming, is not imposed from outside but emerges from the nature of the categories themselves. Being, as pure indeterminacy, necessarily passes over into Nothing, and the contradiction between them is resolved in Becoming.

This immanent development is crucial for understanding Hegel's claim to begin without presuppositions. If the development of categories were imposed from outside, it would presuppose some external principle or method. But if the development emerges from the categories themselves, it can claim to be presuppositionless.

The immanent development of categories is also crucial for understanding the objective status of Hegel's Logic. If the development were merely subjective, imposed by our thinking, it would not reveal anything about reality itself. But if the development is immanent to the categories themselves, it reveals the objective structure of reality.

### The Unity of Form and Content

The Being-Nothing-Becoming triad also illustrates the unity of form and content in Hegel's Logic. The form of the dialectical development (the movement from thesis to antithesis to synthesis) is not separate from the content of the categories but is inseparable from it. The content of Being and Nothing (their indeterminacy) is what leads to their identity and difference, and the content of Becoming (its movement) is what leads to its sublation in Existence.

This unity of form and content is crucial for understanding Hegel's claim that "the necessary forms of thinking, and its specific determinations, are the content and the ultimate truth itself" (29). The logical categories are not merely subjective forms that we impose on an independent content, but are themselves the content of the Logic.

### The Relationship to the Phenomenology of Spirit

The Being-Nothing-Becoming triad also has a significant relationship to Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. In the final chapter of the Phenomenology, "Absolute Knowing," Hegel describes the transition from the Phenomenology to the Logic: "This last shape of Spirit—the Spirit which at the same time gives its complete and true content the form of the Self and thereby realizes its Concept as remaining in its Concept in this realization—this is absolute knowing; it is Spirit that knows itself in the shape of Spirit, or a comprehensive knowing [begreifendes Wissen]" (Phenomenology §798).

This passage suggests that the Logic begins where the Phenomenology ends, with absolute knowing. The Logic is the self-development of absolute knowing, the thinking of thought itself. The Being-Nothing-Becoming triad is the beginning of this self-development, the most abstract and indeterminate form of absolute knowing.

This relationship to the Phenomenology helps us understand why Hegel begins the Logic with Being. Being is the most abstract, indeterminate form of absolute knowing, the thinking of thought itself without any determinate content. It is the beginning of the self-development of absolute knowing, which culminates in the Absolute Idea.

### Heidegger's Critique: The Forgetting of Being

Heidegger's critique of Hegel provides a useful perspective on the role of the Being-Nothing-Becoming triad in the Logic. Heidegger argues that Hegel, like the rest of Western metaphysics, neglects what he calls the "ontological difference" between being and beings. This is the distinction between being itself and the beings that are.

Heidegger suggests that Hegel's treatment of Being, Nothing, and Becoming is a manifestation of the "renunciation of the difference between being and beings" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 15). For Heidegger, this neglect of the ontological difference is not a mere oversight but is constitutive of metaphysics itself.

This critique raises the question of whether Hegel's Logic, despite its claim to think being in its purity, actually thinks being at all. If it neglects the ontological difference, then it may be thinking only beings, not being itself.

However, it is important to note that Heidegger's critique is not a refutation of Hegel but a deepening of his thought. Heidegger is not claiming that Hegel is wrong but that his thought is limited by its metaphysical framework. By bringing attention to the ontological difference, Heidegger opens up a more originary understanding of the relationship between being and nothing.

### Beyond Hegel and Heidegger: Toward a More Originary Understanding

Building on both Hegel and Heidegger, we can develop a more originary understanding of the relationship between being and nothing. This understanding would recognize both the dialectical unity of being and nothing in becoming, as Hegel does, and the ontological difference between being and beings, as Heidegger does.

Such an understanding would see the nothing not merely as the negation of being, nor as identical to being in its indeterminacy, but as what Heidegger calls "the abyssal contrast of beyng" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 16). The nothing would be seen not as the absence of beings but as the clearing in which beings can appear, the openness that allows beings to be.

This more originary understanding would also recognize that the dialectical movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming is not merely a logical development but a fundamental feature of existence itself. The movement between presence and absence, being and nothing, is not just a movement of thought but a movement of reality itself.

### Conclusion: The Significance of the Being-Nothing-Becoming Triad

In conclusion, the Being-Nothing-Becoming triad plays a crucial role in the larger project of the Logic. It serves as a paradigm for the entire dialectical development, reveals the necessity of contradiction, illustrates the immanent development of categories, demonstrates the unity of form and content, and has a significant relationship to the Phenomenology of Spirit.

Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing are not merely logical puzzles but reveal something fundamental about the nature of thought and reality. The contradiction between the identity and difference of Being and Nothing is not a problem to be solved but a dynamic tension that drives the dialectical movement forward.

By examining this contradiction through both Hegelian and Heideggerian lenses, we can develop a more originary understanding of the relationship between being and nothing, one that recognizes both the dialectical unity of being and nothing in becoming and the ontological difference between being and beings.
