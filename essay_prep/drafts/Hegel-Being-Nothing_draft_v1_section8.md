# Hegel's Claims About Being and Nothing

## Section 8: Beyond Hegel and Heidegger: The Ontological Difference and the Truth of Being

Having examined Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing and their role in the larger project of the Logic, we can now develop an original philosophical perspective that goes beyond both Hegel and Heidegger. This perspective will draw on Heidegger's concept of the "ontological difference" between being and beings, while also recognizing the dialectical unity of being and nothing in becoming that Hegel emphasizes.

### The Ontological Difference and Hegel's Logic

Heidegger's critique of Hegel centers on what he calls the "ontological difference" between being and beings. This is the distinction between being itself and the beings that are. Heidegger argues that Hegel, like the rest of Western metaphysics, neglects this difference, treating being as the most general determination of beings rather than as something fundamentally different from beings.

Heidegger writes that "This grounding difference is what in *Being and Time* we called 'ontological difference'" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 15). He suggests that Hegel's claim that the distinction between being and nothing is none is a manifestation of the "renunciation of the difference between being and beings" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 15).

This critique raises the question of whether Hegel's Logic, despite its claim to think being in its purity, actually thinks being at all. If it neglects the ontological difference, then it may be thinking only beings, not being itself.

However, it is important to note that Heidegger's critique is not a refutation of Hegel but a deepening of his thought. Heidegger is not claiming that Hegel is wrong but that his thought is limited by its metaphysical framework. By bringing attention to the ontological difference, Heidegger opens up a more originary understanding of the relationship between being and nothing.

### The Nothing as the Abyssal Contrast of Beyng

Heidegger's understanding of the nothing is fundamentally different from Hegel's. For Hegel, nothing is the complete absence of determination and content, the same as pure, indeterminate being. For Heidegger, the nothing is not merely the negation of beings or the absence of determination, but what he calls "the abyssal contrast of beyng" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 16).

Heidegger writes: "The nothing is the abyssal contrast of beyng, but as this its essence" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 16). This suggests that the nothing is not simply opposed to being but is intrinsic to it, as its "abyssal contrast." The nothing is not the absence of beings but the clearing in which beings can appear, the openness that allows beings to be.

Heidegger also distinguishes between different senses of the "not" and the nothing. He writes, "The not of beings—being (and not the nothing). The not of being—the originary nothing" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 15). This suggests that the nothing that is opposed to beings is different from the nothing that is intrinsic to being itself.

For Heidegger, "To think the nothing means: to inquire into the truth of beyng and to experience the distress [Not] of the totality of beings. To think the nothing is not nihilism" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 16). This suggests that thinking the nothing is not a negative or destructive activity but a way of inquiring into the truth of being itself.

### Toward a More Originary Understanding

Building on both Hegel and Heidegger, we can develop a more originary understanding of the relationship between being and nothing. This understanding would recognize both the dialectical unity of being and nothing in becoming, as Hegel does, and the ontological difference between being and beings, as Heidegger does.

Such an understanding would see the nothing not merely as the negation of being, nor as identical to being in its indeterminacy, but as the clearing in which beings can appear, the openness that allows beings to be. The nothing would be seen not as the absence of beings but as the abyssal contrast of being itself.

This more originary understanding would also recognize that the dialectical movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming is not merely a logical development but a fundamental feature of existence itself. The movement between presence and absence, being and nothing, is not just a movement of thought but a movement of reality itself.

### The Clearing of Being and the Dialectical Movement

One way to develop this more originary understanding is to think of being not as the most general determination of beings, as Hegel does, nor as something completely separate from beings, as Heidegger sometimes suggests, but as the clearing or openness in which beings can appear.

This clearing is not a being itself but the condition for the possibility of beings. It is not something present-at-hand but the openness that allows things to be present. It is not a static condition but a dynamic event, a happening or occurrence.

This understanding of being as clearing can be connected to Hegel's dialectical movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming. The clearing of being is not a static presence but a dynamic movement between presence and absence, being and nothing. It is a becoming, a happening or occurrence.

This connection between the clearing of being and the dialectical movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming allows us to see how Hegel's Logic, despite its neglect of the ontological difference, still captures something essential about the nature of being. The dialectical movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming is not just a logical development but a fundamental feature of the clearing of being itself.

### The Truth of Being and the Dialectical Method

Another way to develop this more originary understanding is to think of the truth of being not as a static correspondence between thought and reality, as the traditional concept of truth suggests, but as the dynamic movement of unconcealment and concealment, as Heidegger suggests.

This understanding of truth as unconcealment can be connected to Hegel's dialectical method. The dialectical movement from thesis to antithesis to synthesis is not just a method of thinking but a way of letting the truth of being show itself. It is a way of letting the dynamic movement of unconcealment and concealment, presence and absence, being and nothing, show itself.

This connection between the truth of being as unconcealment and the dialectical method allows us to see how Hegel's Logic, despite its neglect of the ontological difference, still captures something essential about the truth of being. The dialectical method is not just a method of thinking but a way of letting the truth of being show itself.

### The Finitude of Being and the Absolute Idea

A third way to develop this more originary understanding is to think of being not as infinite and absolute, as Hegel does, but as finite and historical, as Heidegger suggests.

This understanding of being as finite can be connected to Hegel's concept of the Absolute Idea. The Absolute Idea is not a static, eternal truth but the dynamic movement of thought thinking itself. It is not a final, complete truth but the ongoing process of truth showing itself.

This connection between the finitude of being and the Absolute Idea allows us to see how Hegel's Logic, despite its claim to absolute knowledge, still captures something essential about the finitude of being. The Absolute Idea is not a final, complete truth but the ongoing process of truth showing itself in its finitude and historicity.

### Conclusion: Beyond Hegel and Heidegger

In conclusion, by bringing together Hegel's dialectical understanding of the unity of being and nothing in becoming and Heidegger's concept of the ontological difference between being and beings, we can develop a more originary understanding of the relationship between being and nothing.

This understanding sees the nothing not merely as the negation of being, nor as identical to being in its indeterminacy, but as the clearing in which beings can appear, the openness that allows beings to be. It sees the dialectical movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming not merely as a logical development but as a fundamental feature of the clearing of being itself.

This more originary understanding allows us to see how Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing, despite their neglect of the ontological difference, still capture something essential about the nature of being and the truth of being. It also allows us to see how Heidegger's concept of the ontological difference, despite its critique of Hegel, still resonates with Hegel's dialectical understanding of the unity of being and nothing in becoming.

By developing this more originary understanding, we can move beyond both Hegel and Heidegger toward a deeper understanding of the relationship between being and nothing, thought and reality. This understanding recognizes both the dialectical unity of being and nothing in becoming and the ontological difference between being and beings, both the absolute nature of thought thinking itself and the finite, historical nature of being.

This more originary understanding is not a final, complete truth but a step on the way toward a deeper understanding of the relationship between being and nothing, thought and reality. It is not a static, eternal truth but a dynamic movement of truth showing itself in its finitude and historicity.
