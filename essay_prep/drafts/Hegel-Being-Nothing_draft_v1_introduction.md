# Hegel's Claims About Being and Nothing

## Introduction

In the opening pages of his *Science of Logic*, Hegel makes two seemingly contradictory claims: "Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact nothing, and neither more nor less than nothing" (59), and yet "they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct" (60). This apparent contradiction—that Being is Nothing and Being is not Nothing—has puzzled readers of Hegel for generations. How can two categories be both identical and absolutely distinct? Is Hegel simply contradicting himself, or is there a deeper philosophical insight at work?

To understand these claims, we must situate them within Hegel's broader philosophical project. The *Science of Logic* is not a traditional logic textbook concerned with the formal rules of valid inference. Rather, it is an ambitious attempt to think being in its purity, without presuppositions. As Hegel puts it, logic is "the exposition of God as he is in his eternal essence before the creation of nature and of a finite spirit" (29). This means that the Logic begins not with any empirical content or formal rules, but with the most basic category of thought: pure, indeterminate Being.

The challenge of understanding Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing is compounded by the fact that they occur at the very beginning of the Logic, before any determinate categories have been developed. We are asked to think Being in its pure indeterminacy, without any of the determinations that would make it intelligible as a specific being. This is a difficult task, as our thinking naturally tends toward determinacy and concreteness. Yet it is precisely this difficulty that reveals the dialectical nature of thought itself.

In this essay, I argue that Hegel's seemingly contradictory claims about Being and Nothing reveal the fundamental dynamic of thought's self-development. The identity of Being and Nothing stems from their shared indeterminacy, while their difference emerges in their distinct orientations as positive and negative moments. This contradiction is not a logical error but the necessary beginning of thought's self-determination, which initiates the entire dialectical movement of the Logic. By examining this contradiction through both Hegelian and Heideggerian lenses, we can uncover a more originary understanding of the relationship between thought and being.

To develop this argument, I will first situate Hegel's claims within the project of the *Science of Logic* and explain what rules it obeys. I will then clarify the ontological status of Being and Nothing, explaining what kind of entities they are (or are not). Next, I will analyze the nature of Being and Nothing themselves, showing why they are both identical and distinct. I will then explain how Hegel "gets from" Being to Nothing through the immanent dialectic of thought. This will lead to an examination of the resolution of this contradiction in Becoming and its transition to Existence. Finally, I will discuss the role of this contradiction in the larger project of the Logic and develop an original perspective on the relationship between Being and Nothing that goes beyond both Hegel and Heidegger.

Throughout this analysis, I will draw not only on Hegel's text but also on Martin Heidegger's critique of Hegel's concept of being and nothing. Heidegger's concept of the "ontological difference" between being and beings, which he claims Hegel neglects, opens up a more originary understanding of the relationship between being and nothing. By bringing these two thinkers into dialogue, I hope to shed new light on one of the most fundamental questions in philosophy: the relationship between being and nothing, thought and reality.
