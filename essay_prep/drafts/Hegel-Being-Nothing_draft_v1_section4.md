# Hegel's Claims About Being and Nothing

## Section 4: The Dialectical Movement from Being to Nothing

Having examined the nature of Being and Nothing, we can now address the question of how Hegel "gets from" Being to Nothing. This is a crucial question, as it concerns the internal logic of Hegel's dialectic and whether it adheres to the rules we identified in Section 1.

### The Immanent Dialectic of Thought

As we have seen, Hegel's Logic must begin without presuppositions and allow the content to develop through its own immanent dialectic. This means that the transition from Being to Nothing cannot be imposed from outside but must emerge from the nature of Being itself.

Hegel does not explicitly state how this transition occurs, but it can be reconstructed from his characterization of Being. Being is "pure being – without further determination" (59), which means it is completely indeterminate and immediate. But this very indeterminacy creates a problem: if Being is completely indeterminate, then there is nothing to think in it. As Hegel puts it, "There is nothing to be intuited in it, if one can speak here of intuiting; or, it is only this pure empty intuiting itself. Just as little is anything to be thought in it, or, it is equally only this empty thinking" (59).

In other words, the attempt to think pure Being fails because there is nothing determinate to think. This failure is not accidental but necessary, given the nature of Being as pure indeterminacy. And this necessary failure is precisely what Hegel means by Nothing: "Nothing, pure nothingness; it is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, complete absence of determination and content; lack of all distinction within" (59).

Thus, the transition from Being to Nothing occurs through the immanent dialectic of thought itself. The attempt to think pure Being necessarily fails, and this failure is Nothing. Being does not transform into Nothing through some external process; rather, the attempt to think Being reveals it as Nothing.

### The Necessity of the Transition

It is important to emphasize that this transition is not arbitrary or contingent but necessary. It follows from the nature of Being itself as pure indeterminacy. If Being is completely indeterminate, then there is nothing determinate to think in it. But if there is nothing determinate to think in it, then it is Nothing.

This necessity is what Hegel means when he says that "Being has passed over into nothing and nothing into being" (59-60). The use of the past tense ("has passed over") is significant. It indicates that the transition is not something that happens in time but is already accomplished in the very nature of Being and Nothing.

Hegel makes this point explicitly: "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same" (59). This is not a paradoxical claim but a necessary consequence of the nature of Being and Nothing as pure thought-determinations.

### The Role of Negation

The transition from Being to Nothing involves a form of negation, but it is important to understand what kind of negation this is. It is not the negation of one determinate content by another, as when we say "This is not that." Such a negation presupposes determinate entities, which is precisely what is lacking in pure Being.

Rather, the negation involved in the transition from Being to Nothing is what Hegel calls "absolute negativity." This is not the negation of something determinate but the negation of indeterminacy itself. It is the recognition that pure indeterminacy is unthinkable, that the attempt to think pure Being necessarily fails.

Heidegger helps us understand this point in his analysis of Hegel's concept of negativity. He writes that "Negativity is therefore at the same time sublation. The absolute trembling—the absolute shaking of everything. Death the 'absolute lord'" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 17). This suggests that negativity is not merely a logical operation but a fundamental aspect of reality itself.

### The Coherence with the Rules of the Logic

Does this transition from Being to Nothing cohere with the rules of the Logic that we identified in Section 1? Let us examine each rule:

1. Begin with the most abstract, indeterminate category possible, without presupposing any determinate content.
   - The transition begins with Being, which is the most abstract, indeterminate category possible.

2. Allow this category to develop through its own internal dialectic, without introducing external reflections.
   - The transition from Being to Nothing occurs through the immanent dialectic of thought itself, not through external reflection.

3. Maintain the unity of form and content, treating the logical categories as both the method and the subject matter of the Logic.
   - The transition maintains the unity of form and content, as the form of the transition (the dialectical movement) is inseparable from its content (what Being and Nothing are).

4. Do not appeal to examples, intuitions, or representations to justify the development.
   - The transition does not appeal to examples, intuitions, or representations but follows from the nature of Being and Nothing as pure thought-determinations.

5. Do not presuppose the distinction between subject and object, or between thought and being.
   - The transition does not presuppose the distinction between subject and object, or between thought and being, but treats Being and Nothing as pure thought-determinations with an objective status.

Thus, the transition from Being to Nothing coheres with the rules of the Logic. It is not imposed from outside but emerges from the nature of Being itself as pure indeterminacy.

### Heidegger's Critique: The Renunciation of the Ontological Difference

Heidegger's critique of Hegel provides a useful perspective on the transition from Being to Nothing. Heidegger argues that Hegel, like the rest of Western metaphysics, neglects what he calls the "ontological difference" between being and beings. This is the distinction between being itself and the beings that are.

Heidegger suggests that Hegel's claim that the distinction between being and nothing is none is a manifestation of the "renunciation of the difference between being and beings" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 15). For Heidegger, this neglect of the ontological difference is not a mere oversight but is constitutive of metaphysics itself.

This critique raises the question of whether Hegel's transition from Being to Nothing is as presuppositionless as he claims. If it presupposes the renunciation of the ontological difference, then it may not be as absolute a beginning as Hegel suggests.

However, it is important to note that Heidegger's critique is not a refutation of Hegel but a deepening of his thought. Heidegger is not claiming that Hegel is wrong but that his thought is limited by its metaphysical framework. By bringing attention to the ontological difference, Heidegger opens up a more originary understanding of the relationship between being and nothing.

### Conclusion: The Immanent Dialectic from Being to Nothing

In conclusion, Hegel "gets from" Being to Nothing through the immanent dialectic of thought itself. The attempt to think pure Being necessarily fails, and this failure is Nothing. This transition is not imposed from outside but emerges from the nature of Being itself as pure indeterminacy.

This understanding of the transition from Being to Nothing allows us to make sense of Hegel's seemingly contradictory claims. Being is Nothing because the attempt to think pure Being necessarily fails, revealing it as Nothing. But Being is not Nothing because they have different orientations or perspectives.

In the next section, we will examine how this contradiction between the identity and difference of Being and Nothing is resolved in Becoming, and how this resolution leads to the category of Existence.
