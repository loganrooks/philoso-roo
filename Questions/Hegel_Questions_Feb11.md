# Hegel's Science of Logic - Week 6 Questions and Answers
## Pages 82-89 and 108-125

1. Given that Hegel characterizes existence (Dasein) as "determinate being" with quality as its determinateness, how does he explain the relationship between something's quality and its capacity for alteration? What makes something both determinate and yet capable of change?

### Answer:
Hegel's account of the relationship between quality and alteration is complex and dialectical:

* **Quality as Determinateness**:
  - Quality is "something totally simple, immediate" (p. 85)
  - It constitutes the very being of something, making it what it is
  - As Hegel states: "Through its quality, something is opposed to an other; it is alterable and finite" (p. 83)

* **The Dialectic of Quality and Change**:
  - Quality contains within itself the seeds of its own alteration
  - This is because quality involves both:
    1. Being (determinateness)
    2. Non-being (the capacity for change)
  - As Hegel notes: "existence is determinate being; its determinateness is existent determinateness, quality" (p. 83)

* **Resolution Through Negation**:
  - Something can change precisely because its quality includes negation
  - "This negation in it, in contrast at first with the finite something, is the infinite" (p. 83)
  - The negative aspect within quality allows for:
    - Opposition to others
    - Internal differentiation
    - The possibility of transformation

2. On pages 83-84, Hegel emphasizes that existence is "being with a non-being." How does this paradoxical formulation help explain the nature of determinate being, and why does Hegel insist that non-being must be "taken up into simple unity with being"?

### Answer:
Hegel's paradoxical formulation reveals fundamental aspects of determinate being:

* **The Unity of Being and Non-being**:
  - "Non-being thus taken up into being with the result that the concrete whole is in the form of being, of immediacy, constitutes determinateness as such" (p. 84)
  - This unity is necessary because:
    1. Pure being is indeterminate
    2. Determination requires negation
    3. The negation must be incorporated into being itself

* **Key Aspects of This Unity**:
  - It is not a mere combination but a "simple unity"
  - The non-being is "taken up" (aufgehoben) into being
  - This creates a new form of immediacy

* **Implications for Determinate Being**:
  - Something can only be determinate by including what it is not
  - As Hegel explains: "existence proceeds from becoming. It is the simple oneness of being and nothing" (p. 83)
  - This explains how things can be:
    - Distinct from other things
    - Internally structured
    - Capable of development

3. Given Hegel's discussion of reality and negation on pages 85-87, how does he understand the relationship between these two concepts, particularly in light of his criticism of the metaphysical concept of God as "the sum-total of all realities"? Why does he argue this conception fails?

### Answer:

* **Reality and Negation as Interrelated**:
  - Reality is not pure positivity but contains negation within itself
  - "Reality is quality, existence; it therefore contains the moment of the negative" (p. 86)
  - The traditional metaphysical concept fails by trying to separate them

* **Critique of Traditional Metaphysics**:
  - The conception of God as "sum-total of all realities" assumes:
    - Realities are purely positive
    - Realities don't contradict each other
    - Negation can be excluded
  - Hegel argues this leads to:
    - "The same empty absolute, void of determination and content" (p. 86)
    - Loss of all concrete determination
    - A meaningless abstraction

* **True Understanding of Reality**:
  - Reality necessarily includes determination
  - Determination necessarily includes negation
  - As Hegel states: "to do this is to remove all determinateness from reality" (p. 86)

4. Considering Hegel's analysis of Spinoza's proposition that "all determination is negation" (pages 87-88), how does this principle relate to Hegel's own understanding of the relationship between determination and negation? What are the implications for understanding finite beings?

### Answer:

* **Spinoza's Influence on Hegel**:
  - Hegel sees Spinoza's proposition as "of infinite importance" (p. 87)
  - Key points of agreement:
    - Determination requires negation
    - Unity emerges through negation
    - The finite is inherently self-negating

* **Hegel's Development of the Principle**:
  - Goes beyond Spinoza's "formless abstraction" of negation
  - Shows how negation leads to concrete determination
  - As Hegel notes: "negation is as little an ultimate for it as reality is for it the truth" (p. 87)

* **Implications for Finite Beings**:
  - Finite beings are inherently self-contradictory
  - They contain both:
    - Positive self-assertion
    - Negative self-transcendence
  - As Hegel explains: "The individual refers to itself by setting limits to every other" (p. 87)

5. On pages 108-110, Hegel introduces the distinction between "true infinity" and "bad infinity." What characterizes "bad infinity" according to Hegel, and why does he argue it represents the "infinite of understanding" rather than the "infinite of reason"?

### Answer:

* **Characteristics of "Bad Infinity"**:
  - Stands opposed to the finite as its mere negation
  - Creates an endless progression beyond each limit
  - As Hegel states: "The infinite remains over against the finite, with the result that there are two determinacies" (p. 111)

* **Problems with Understanding's Conception**:
  - Maintains rigid separation between finite and infinite
  - Creates "two worlds, one infinite and one finite" (p. 111)
  - Results in contradiction:
    - Infinite becomes finite by being limited by finite
    - Progress to infinity never reaches completion

* **Contrast with True Infinity**:
  - Incorporates the finite within itself
  - Resolves the contradiction through self-relation
  - "The infinite is rather for itself just as much finite as infinite" (p. 109)

6. Given Hegel's critique of the "progress to infinity" (pages 111-114), why does he argue that this conception represents a contradiction that "pretends to be itself a solution"? How does this relate to his critique of Kantian philosophy?

### Answer:

* **The Problem of Infinite Progress**:
  - Each transcendence leads to new limit
  - Process repeats endlessly without resolution
  - As Hegel notes: "This progress breaks out wherever relative determinations are pressed to the point of opposition" (p. 113)

* **False Solution**:
  - Appears to resolve contradiction but perpetuates it
  - Key issues:
    - Keeps finite and infinite separate
    - Never achieves true unity
    - Remains stuck in "repetitious monotony" (p. 113)

* **Critique of Kant**:
  - Kantian philosophy remains at level of understanding
  - "The philosophy of Kant and Fichte holds out the ought as the resolution of the contradictions of reason" (p. 107)
  - Fails to achieve true speculative unity

7. On pages 114-116, Hegel discusses the "unity of the finite and infinite." Why does he argue this unity is not simply an "external bringing together" of two separate terms? How does this relate to his concept of "true infinity"?

### Answer:

* **Nature of True Unity**:
  - Not external combination but internal relation
  - As Hegel states: "Each is itself this unity, and this only as a sublating of itself" (p. 116)
  - Unity emerges through self-transcendence

* **Dynamic Process**:
  - Finite and infinite are moments of same movement
  - Each contains other within itself
  - "The unity of the finite and infinite is not an external bringing together of them" (p. 115)

* **Relation to True Infinity**:
  - True infinity is self-relating negativity
  - Includes both finite and infinite as moments
  - Achieves concrete unity through self-mediation

8. Considering Hegel's discussion of idealism on pages 124-125, why does he claim that "every philosophy is essentially idealism"? How does this relate to his earlier discussion of the relationship between the finite and the infinite?

### Answer:

* **Universal Nature of Idealism**:
  - As Hegel states: "The idealism of philosophy consists in nothing else than in the recognition that the finite is not truly an existent" (p. 124)
  - All genuine philosophy recognizes:
    - Finite is not absolute
    - Truth requires transcendence of finite
    - Reality is inherently ideal

* **Connection to Finite/Infinite Relation**:
  - Finite must be understood as moment of infinite
  - Neither purely subjective nor purely objective
  - As Hegel notes: "The principles of ancient as well as more recent philosophies...are universals, idealizations" (p. 124)

* **Implications**:
  - True reality is self-determining spirit
  - Finite things are "idealizations" of infinite
  - Philosophy must grasp concrete unity of both
