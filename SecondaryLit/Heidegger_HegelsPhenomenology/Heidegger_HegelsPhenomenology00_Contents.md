FIRST PART

Consciouness

Chapter One Sense Certainty

§  6.  Sense certainty and the immediacy

a)  Immediate knowledge as the first necessary object for us who know absolutely

b)  The being-in-and-for-itself of the subject-matter and the contemplation of absolute knowledge. “Absolvent” absolute knowledge

c)  The immediacy of the object and of the knowing of sense certainty. “Pure being” and extantness

d)  Distinctions and mediation in the pure being of what is immediate in sense certainty. The multiplicity of examples of the this and the this as I and as object

e)  The experience of the difference between immediacy and mediation. What is essential and not essential in sense certainty itself. The this as the essence, its significance as now and here, and the universal as the essence of the this

f)  Language as the expression of what is universal and the singular item which is intended—the ontological difference and dialectic

§  7.  Mediatedness as the essence of what is immediate and the dialectical movement

a)  Intention as the essence of sense certainty. The singularity and universality of intending

b)  The immediacy of sense certainty as non-differentiation of I and object. The demonstrated singular now in its movement toward the universal

c)  The infinity of absolute knowledge as the being-sublated of the finite and as dialectic. The starting point of a confrontation with Hegel’s dialectic—the infinitude or finitude of being

d)  Points of orientation regarding the problem of the infinity of being: The absolvence of spirit from what is relative. The logical and subjective justification of infinity

Chapter Two Perception

§  8.  Consciousness of perception and its object

a)  Perception as mediation and transition from sense certainty to understanding

b)  The thing as what is essential in perception. Thingness as the unity of the “also” of properties

c)  The exclusive unity of the thing as condition for having properties. The perceptual object’s having of properties and the possibility of deception

§  9.  The mediating and contradictory character of perception

a)  The possibility of deception as the ground of the contradiction in perception as taking and reflection

b)  The reciprocal distribution of the contradictory one and “also” of the thing to perceiving as taking and reflection

c)  The contradiction of the thing in itself—being for itself and being for an other—and the failure of the reflection of perception

Chapter Three Force and Understanding

§10.  The absolute character of cognition

a)  Absolute cognition as ontotheology

b)  The unity of the contradiction of the thing in its essence as force

c)  Finite and absolute cognition—“Appearance and the Supersensible World”

§11.  The transition from consciousness to self-consciousness

a)  Force and the play of forces. Being-for-itself in being-for-another

b)  The appearance of the play of forces and the unity of the law

c)  The infinity of the I. Spirit as λόγος, I, God, and ὄv

SECOND PART

Self-consciouness

§12.  Self-consciousness as the truth of consciousness

a)  “The Truth of Self-certainty”

b)  The significance of the transition from consciousness to self-consciousness

§13.  The being of self-consciousness

a)  The attainment of the self-being of the self in its independence

b)  The new concept of being as inhering-in-itself, life. Being and time in Hegel—Being and Time
