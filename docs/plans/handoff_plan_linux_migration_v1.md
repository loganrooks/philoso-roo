# Handoff Plan: Linux Migration & V18.3.3 Implementation Continuation (V1)

**Date:** 2025-05-04
**Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Finalized for Handover

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the handover plan for the "Hegel Philosophy RooCode Suite" project. It details the current project state, overall trajectory, and immediate next steps required for a new system instance to resume work following migration to a Linux environment.

## 2. Current Project State

*   **Architecture:** V18.3.3, documented in `docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md`.
    *   **Key Features:** Direct Knowledge Base (KB) and Operational Context access patterns, removal of `kb-doctor` mode and script dependencies, focus on philosophical rigor, strict separation between KB (`philosophy-knowledge-base/`) and Memory Bank (`memory-bank/`).
*   **Last Completed Step:** Architecture V18.3.3 revision and verification completed by the system instance [See Active Context: 2025-05-04 22:01:00].
*   **Memory Bank:** Active and updated as of 2025-05-04 22:12:22.
    *   **Key Context Files:**
        *   `memory-bank/activeContext.md`
        *   `memory-bank/globalContext.md`
        *   `memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-orchestrator.md`
        *   `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-orchestrator-feedback.md`
*   **Key Artifacts:**
    *   `docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md` (Version 18.3.3)
    *   `scripts/process_source_text.py` (Version 2.0 - Hierarchical/JSON Output)
    *   `docs/standards/clinerules_standard_v1.md`

## 3. Overall Project Trajectory

The primary goal is to implement the Hegel Philosophy RooCode Suite based on the V18.3.3 architecture. The implementation should prioritize:

*   **Philosophical Rigor:** Ensuring modes operate with conceptual clarity and handle evidence appropriately.
*   **Modularity:** Maintaining clear separation of concerns between modes.
*   **RooCode Capabilities:** Leveraging features like Memory Bank, context management, and potentially new MCP tools/documentation available in the Linux environment.

The general project phases are:
1.  Architecture Definition (V18.3.3 - Complete)
2.  Specification Definition (Potentially required to elaborate V18.3.3 details if needed)
3.  Implementation (Updating/Creating `.clinerules`, `.roomodes`, scripts)
4.  Integration Verification
5.  Testing (TDD/QA)
6.  Refinement & Optimization

## 4. Immediate Next Steps (Post-Migration & Handover)

The new system instance should perform the following steps upon initialization in the Linux environment:

1.  **Initialize Memory Bank:** Read `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/globalContext.md`, `memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-orchestrator.md`, and `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-orchestrator-feedback.md`.
2.  **Review Key Documents:** Familiarize with this plan (`docs/plans/handoff_plan_linux_migration_v1.md`) and the current architecture (`docs/architecture/architecture_v18.md` - V18.3.3).
3.  **Resume Original Plan (Step 8):**
    *   Delegate the update of `.roo/rules-philosophy-text-processor/philosophy-text-processor.clinerules` to `code` mode.
    *   **Ensure alignment with V18.3.3 architecture:** Specifically, verify the mode correctly parses the JSON output from `scripts/process_source_text.py` (V2) and performs direct writes to the `philosophy-knowledge-base/` according to defined patterns.
    *   Verify the changes made by `code` mode.
4.  **Continue Original Plan (Steps 9-12):**
    *   **Step 9:** Sequentially correct the remaining `.clinerules` files for other philosophy modes. Verify each update against V18.3.3 architecture and `docs/standards/clinerules_standard_v1.md`.
    *   **Step 10:** Update the `.roo/.roomodes` file to reflect the active modes in V18.3.3. Verify.
    *   **Step 11:** Perform Integration Verification (equivalent to Phase 3, Step 2 in previous plans) against the V18.3.3 baseline. Generate an integration verification report.
    *   **Step 12:** Complete the overall task using `attempt_completion`.

## 5. Considerations for New Environment (Linux)

*   **File Paths:** Ensure all file paths used in configurations, scripts, and documentation consistently use the Linux forward-slash (`/`) convention. Verify existing artifacts.
*   **MCP Tools / RooCode Docs:** Explore if the new Linux environment provides access to additional MCP tools or updated RooCode documentation. Evaluate if these resources can be leveraged to refine the V18.3.3 architecture or implementation approach for improved efficiency or capability.
