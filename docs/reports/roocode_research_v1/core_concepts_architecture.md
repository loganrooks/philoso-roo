## 1. Fundamental Concept: Autonomous Agent

RooCode is positioned as an **AI-powered autonomous coding agent** residing within the VS Code editor environment. Its primary goal is to assist developers by understanding natural language instructions and performing tasks that involve interacting with the coding workspace.

Key characteristics:
- **Natural Language Interface:** Interacts via chat.
- **Workspace Awareness:** Can read/write files and execute commands within the user's project context.
- **Task Execution:** Capable of performing coding tasks (generation, refactoring, debugging), documentation, automation, and answering questions.

## 2. Modes: Specialized Personas

A core architectural concept is the use of **Modes**. Each mode represents a specialized AI persona with distinct instructions, capabilities, and potentially different underlying models or configurations.

- **Purpose:** To tailor the agent's behavior and expertise for specific types of tasks (e.g., coding vs. architectural planning vs. debugging).
- **Standard Modes (Examples from Docs):**
    - `Code`: General coding tasks.
    - `Architect`: Planning, technical leadership, system design (relevant to this current task).
    - `Ask`: Information retrieval, answering questions about the codebase.
    - `Debug`: Systematic problem diagnosis.
    - `Orchestrator`: Managing complex workflows, delegating tasks to other modes (critical for complex projects).
- **Structure:** Modes are defined by `.clinerules` files, which contain identity information, custom instructions, rules, and potentially specific configurations (See [Modes & Customization](./modes_customization.md)).
- **Switching:** Users can switch between modes using the UI or potentially via the `switch_mode` tool.

## 3. Tools: Interacting with the Environment

Modes achieve tasks by utilizing a set of **Tools**. These provide the agent with concrete actions it can perform.

- **Function:** Bridge the gap between the AI's reasoning and the developer's environment.
- **Standard Tool Categories (Based on Docs/Crawl):**
    - **File System Interaction:** Reading, writing, searching, modifying files (e.g., `read_file`, `write_to_file`, `apply_diff`, `insert_content`, `search_files`, `list_files`).
    - **Code Analysis:** Understanding code structure (e.g., `list_code_definition_names`).
    - **Terminal Execution:** Running shell commands (`execute_command`).
    - **User Interaction:** Asking clarifying questions (`ask_followup_question`), signaling completion (`attempt_completion`).
    - **Mode/Task Management:** Switching modes (`switch_mode`), creating sub-tasks (`new_task`).
    - **MCP Interaction:** Using tools/resources from external servers (`use_mcp_tool`, `access_mcp_resource`).
- **Tool Usage:** Tools are invoked by the AI using a specific syntax (XML-like structure shown in general RooCode instructions). Tool use requires user approval by default, but this can be configured ([Auto-Approving Actions](./best_practices_patterns.md)).
- **Detailed Tool Info:** See [Standard Tools](./standard_tools.md).

## 4. Model Context Protocol (MCP): Extensibility

MCP is RooCode's primary mechanism for extending its capabilities beyond the built-in tools.

- **Purpose:** Allows connecting RooCode to external "MCP servers" which provide custom tools and data resources.
- **Functionality:** Enables integration with external APIs, databases, web services (search, scraping), version control systems (like GitHub), and custom developer tools.
- **Interaction:** Modes use the `use_mcp_tool` and `access_mcp_resource` tools to interact with connected MCP servers.
- **Architecture:** Supports different server transport mechanisms (Stdio, SSE).
- **Detailed MCP Info:** See [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](./mcp.md).

## 5. Task Management & Workflow

RooCode includes features for managing complex tasks and workflows.

- **Delegation:** The `new_task` tool allows a task (often managed by an `Orchestrator` mode) to create sub-tasks, potentially assigning them to different, more specialized modes. This facilitates breaking down large problems.
- **Boomerang Tasks:** This pattern (mentioned in docs) likely involves a sub-task performing work and then returning control or results back to the parent/orchestrating task.
- **Checkpoints:** Allow saving the state of a task (including chat history, mode state, potentially Memory Bank state) so it can be resumed later. This is crucial for long-running tasks or managing context limits.

## 6. Memory Bank & Context

While core documentation focuses heavily on tools and modes, the concept of a **Memory Bank** is evident in community projects (SPARC, Memory Bank Project) and the structure observed within `philoso-roo`.

- **Purpose (Inferred):** To provide persistent context storage across multiple interactions, tasks, and potentially sessions. This helps mitigate context window limitations of LLMs and maintain project history/decisions.
- **Structure (Observed in `philoso-roo`):** Typically involves a `memory-bank/` directory with files like:
    - `activeContext.md`: Chronological log of recent actions/status within the current task.
    - `globalContext.md`: Longer-term project context, system patterns, decision logs, progress summaries.
    - `mode-specific/`: Logs or context specific to individual modes.
    - `feedback/`: Logs for user feedback and interventions.
- **Interaction:** Modes likely interact with the Memory Bank using standard file tools (`read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) according to rules defined in their `.clinerules`.
- **Detailed Context Info:** See [Data Flow & Context Management](./dataflow_context.md).

## 7. Overall Architectural Interaction

RooCode's architecture appears modular, centered around the interaction between Modes, Tools, and the underlying AI model, facilitated by the VS Code extension framework.

- **User Interaction:** User provides tasks/prompts via chat.
- **Mode Selection:** User selects (or an Orchestrator delegates to) an appropriate Mode.
- **AI Processing:** The AI model, guided by the selected Mode's rules and instructions (`.clinerules`, custom instructions), processes the request and decides on actions.
- **Tool Invocation:** If an action requires interacting with the environment, the AI invokes a Tool (standard or MCP).
- **Execution & Feedback:** The tool executes (often requiring user approval), and the result/output is fed back into the chat and AI context.
- **Iteration:** The AI processes the tool result and continues the task, potentially invoking more tools or generating a response/code.
- **Context Management:** Memory Bank (likely) and Checkpoints help manage context across these interactions.
- **Extensibility:** MCP allows integrating external capabilities seamlessly into this loop.
