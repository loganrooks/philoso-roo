# RooCode Detailed Research Report (v1)

Date: 2025-05-05

## Overview

This report provides a detailed analysis of RooCode documentation, expanding upon the initial summary (`docs/reports/roocode_research_summary_v1.md`). It is based on content crawled from `https://docs.roocode.com/` (Firecrawl Job ID: `0d438814-566c-402a-bd97-e9387ed5c9b4`) and review of related GitHub repositories.

The goal is to offer specific details on RooCode's architecture, features, and best practices to inform the evaluation and potential refinement of the `philoso-roo` project architecture (V18.3.3).
