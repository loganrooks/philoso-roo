# .clinerules Review Report V1

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Author:** Architect Mode
**Context:** Review of specified `.clinerules` files for consistency with `architecture_v12.md` and `new_requirements_spec_v1.md`, following identification of a flawed SPARC handover.
**Reference Documents:**
*   `architecture_v12.md`
*   `new_requirements_spec_v1.md`
*   `artifact_review_report_v1.md`
*   Memory Bank Context

## 1. Overall Summary

The review found varying levels of consistency with the V12 architecture across the examined `.clinerules` files. While some files (like `philosophy-verification-agent`) show good alignment with V12 specifics regarding text processor outputs, others (`philosophy-orchestrator`, `philosophy-essay-prep`, `philosophy-citation-manager`) exhibit significant inconsistencies, particularly concerning the integration of the script-based `philosophy-text-processor`'s detailed outputs (hierarchical indices, citation location data) and the Git-based version control system. The `philosophy-draft-generator` appears mostly consistent but lacks explicit handling of V12 data structures.

**Recommendation:** Several files require updates or regeneration to fully align with V12 before proceeding with further implementation or testing.

## 2. Detailed File Review

### 2.1. `.roo/rules-philosophy-draft-generator/philosophy-draft-generator.clinerules`

*   **Assessment:** Mostly Consistent with V12 workflow sequence.
*   **Inconsistencies/Gaps:**
    *   Lacks explicit mention of expecting or utilizing the detailed hierarchical index/chunk structure or detailed citation *location* data potentially provided within the `evidence_package` from `philosophy-evidence-manager` (as generated by the V12 `philosophy-text-processor`).
    *   Correctly omits direct Git operations, aligning with V12.
*   **Recommendation:** Requires minor updates to explicitly acknowledge and potentially utilize the richer V12 data structures within the `evidence_package` for more context-aware drafting.

### 2.2. `.roo/rules-philosophy-citation-manager/philosophy-citation-manager.clinerules`

*   **Assessment:** Inconsistent with V12 specifics.
*   **Inconsistencies/Gaps:**
    *   **Text Processor Data:** Fails to specify querying for or utilizing the *detailed citation location data* provided by the V12 `philosophy-text-processor` via `philosophy-evidence-manager`. Memory bank logging formats (`evidence_links_format`) also lack fields for this data.
    *   **Version Control:** Contains no logic related to V12 Git version control workflows (e.g., triggering commits).
*   **Recommendation:** Requires significant updates to integrate the use of detailed citation location data from the evidence manager and potentially add commit triggers as per V12 workflow coordination.

### 2.3. `.roo/rules-philosophy-verification-agent/philosophy-verification-agent.clinerules`

*   **Assessment:** Largely Consistent with V12.
*   **Inconsistencies/Gaps:**
    *   Standard sections (Memory Bank, Error Handling) contain `# TBD` placeholders, indicating incompleteness, but the core verification logic aligns well.
    *   Correctly omits Git operations.
*   **Consistency Points:**
    *   Explicitly references using detailed citation data and paths/indices to processed source chunks via `philosophy-evidence-manager` (Lines 13, 14, 24, 25, 53, 58).
    *   Correctly defines interactions with `evidence-manager`, `essay-prep`, and `orchestrator` per V12.
*   **Recommendation:** Appears mostly consistent with V12 core logic. Requires completion of placeholder sections (Memory Bank, Error Handling) following standard V12 patterns.

### 2.4. `.roo/rules-philosophy-orchestrator/philosophy-orchestrator.clinerules`

*   **Assessment:** Significantly Inconsistent with V12. Likely based on V11 or flawed V1 plan.
*   **Inconsistencies/Gaps:**
    *   **Text Processor:** References the outdated V11 `philosophy-text-processing` mode name and lacks logic for orchestrating the V12 script-based `philosophy-text-processor`.
    *   **Version Control:** Completely omits logic for coordinating Git commits within workflows, a key V12 requirement.
    *   **Handoffs:** Handoff protocols are generic and don't specify handling of V12 data types (indices, detailed citations).
*   **Recommendation:** Requires regeneration based *strictly* on `architecture_v12.md` and `new_requirements_spec_v1.md`. The current file is unsuitable.

### 2.5. `.roo/rules-philosophy-essay-prep/philosophy-essay-prep.clinerules`

*   **Assessment:** Significantly Inconsistent with V12. Explicitly based on V11.
*   **Inconsistencies/Gaps:**
    *   **V11 Base:** Explicitly states V11 alignment (Lines 3, 763, 775).
    *   **Text Processor Data:** Does not incorporate querying/utilizing V12 hierarchical indices or detailed citation location data. Context preparation for delegated tasks lacks these specifics.
    *   **Version Control:** Completely missing the Git integration responsibilities (command execution, commit logic) assigned in V12.
    *   **Internal Inconsistency:** Fails to specify providing necessary V12 data (chunk paths, detailed citation data) when delegating to the `philosophy-verification-agent`.
*   **Recommendation:** Requires substantial rewrite to align with V12. Must implement Git version control responsibilities and integrate handling of V12 text processor outputs via the evidence manager.

## 3. Next Steps

1.  Prioritize updating/regenerating the `.clinerules` files identified as inconsistent (`philosophy-orchestrator`, `philosophy-essay-prep`, `philosophy-citation-manager`).
2.  Perform minor updates on `philosophy-draft-generator`.
3.  Complete placeholder sections in `philosophy-verification-agent`.
4.  Ensure all updates are strictly based on `architecture_v12.md` and `new_requirements_spec_v1.md`.
