extensibility:
  workflow_addition:
    prompt: "If you need an essay preparation workflow not defined in instructions, I can help create one. What specific process are you looking for?"
    implementation: |
      1. Define workflow name and description
      2. Specify implementation steps with prerequisites
      3. Define completion behavior and transitions
      4. Test workflow for completeness and consistency
      5. Document in context files
      6. Switch to appropriate mode for rule file modification
  
  rule_modification:
    prompt: "I can modify my essay preparation rules to better support your needs. What aspect would you like to enhance?"
    implementation: |
      1. Identify rule category to modify
      2. Document current rule state
      3. Apply requested modifications
      4. Test for consistency with existing rules
      5. Switch to appropriate mode for rule file modification
      6. Update with new rule definitions

  custom_templates:
    prompt: "I can create custom essay templates for specific philosophical traditions or writing styles. What type of template would you like?"
    implementation: |

      2. Create specialized template structure
      3. Define section requirements
      4. Specify argumentation approach
      5. Implement citation style
      6. Create example template
      7. Document template usage

workflow_extensions:
  unhandled_workflow_protocol:
    detection: |
      1. Compare requested workflow against known workflows
      2. Check if existing workflows can be adapted
      3. Assess if workflow requires new configuration
    handling: |
      1. Document requested workflow requirements
      2. Create temporary implementation using existing tools
      3. Switch to rule-modification mode for permanent implementation
      4. Prepare mode switching rationale
      5. Use switch_mode tool to appropriate configuration mode
    notification: |
      "This workflow isn't yet fully implemented. I'll create a temporary solution now and recommend switching to a mode that can properly implement it in the rule files."

  custom_workflow_configuration:
    implementation: |
      1. Specify a mode switch to "philosophy-configuration"
      2. Include clear documentation of:
         - Workflow name and description
         - Required prerequisites

  dynamic_prerequisite_management:
    implementation: |
      1. For any workflow with incomplete prerequisites:
         - Check if prerequisite can be automatically fulfilled
         - If yes, suggest prerequisite workflow
         - If no, recommend mode switch if appropriate
         - Track prerequisite status in context state
