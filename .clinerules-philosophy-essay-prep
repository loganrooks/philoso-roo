       d. Contrast with ordinary language usage
       e. Distinguish from related philosophical concepts

    implementation: |
      1. For each essay draft:
         - Verify all claims have supporting evidence
         - Check that major claims have direct quotes
         - Ensure all sources have proper citations
         - Validate that all interpretations acknowledge alternatives
         - Verify each key concept includes negative determination
         - Check disambiguation of potentially ambiguous terms
         - Validate contrast between author's usage and ordinary language
         - Verify bullet points maintain determinacy and only remove filler words
         - Check that bullet points preserve required depth and detail
      2. Calculate evidence coverage percentage
      3. Flag sections below threshold
      4. Block completion if evidence standards not met
      5. Generate verification report

  content_reuse:
    implementation: |
      1. For concepts already defined in other analyses:
         - Reference existing definition instead of duplicating
         - Use section references to specific determinations
      2. For evidence already quoted elsewhere:
         - Reference evidence repository instead of duplicating quotes
         - Include minimal context with reference to full quote
      3. For argument structures reused:
         - Reference canonical argument rather than duplicating
         - Use argument references with unique identifiers
      4. For critique elements applicable to multiple drafts:
         - Create reusable critique components
         - Reference standard improvement patterns

      implementation: |
        1. Locate section by unique identifier
        2. Replace only that section's content

      usage: "For updating specific critique sections"
      implementation: |
        1. Identify critique section needing update
        2. Apply targeted update to only that section
        3. Maintain version history with minimal duplication

instructions: |
  The essay-prep mode provides a framework for developing philosophical essays with rigorous conceptual determination and evidence standards, along with a continuous self-improvement workflow. Follow these guidelines:
  
  1. CHRONOLOGICAL INTEGRITY:
     - Always respect the course chronology
     - Only reference analyzed dates and materials
     - Verify completion of referenced material
  
  2. EVIDENCE STANDARDS:
     - Ground all interpretations in direct quotations
     - Include page/timestamp references for all claims
     - Provide multiple quotes for key concepts
     - Ensure all concepts have both positive and negative determination
  
  3. CONCEPTUAL DETERMINACY:
     - Define key terms both positively and negatively
     - Contrast philosophical usage with ordinary language
     - Identify and address potential misinterpretations
     - Distinguish related concepts clearly
  
  4. ANALYSIS STRUCTURE:
     - Can use bullet points, just make sure that you are only removing filler words that don't contribute much to the determinacy of the meaning of whatever it is you are writing
     - Maintain the same level of depth, detail, and determinacy while removing filler
     - Use concept templates consistently
     - Provide extensive direct quotations
     - Structure analyses according to the templates
  
  5. WORKFLOW:
     - Begin with prompt analysis
     - Develop thesis with determined concepts
     - Map arguments with textual evidence
     - Create outline based on arguments
     - Write draft with extensive quotation
     - Initiate improvement cycles
     - Implement improvements until user satisfaction
     - Finalize essay with verification
  
  6. MATERIAL AVAILABILITY:
     - Check materials_status.md for lecture/reading availability
     - For lecture transcripts: Use direct quotes with timestamps
     - For lecture notes: Use with appropriate confidence markers
     - For missing materials: Use secondary literature with clear marking
     - Always check availability before referencing materials
  
  7. ACTIVE CONTEXT:
     - Create checkpoints at strategic points
     - Document essay development progress
     - Use targeted updates for efficiency
     - Reference shared content rather than duplicating
  
  8. CONTINUOUS IMPROVEMENT:
     - Every draft undergoes rigorous self-critique
     - Evaluate arguments for strength, validity, and soundness
     - Assess conceptual clarity and technical term usage
     - Check for originality and philosophical insight
     - Track improvements across versions
     - Implement specific, actionable improvements
     - Continue iterating until user satisfaction
     - Document rationale for all changes
