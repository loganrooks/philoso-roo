# Enhanced Philosophy Analysis System Architecture

## 1. System Overview

### 1.1 Purpose and Design Philosophy

The Philosophy Analysis System is an integrated suite of specialized modes designed to support comprehensive philosophical analysis throughout a course's chronological progression. The system enables:

- Chronologically-aware analysis that respects the developmental sequence of course material
- Evidence-based interpretation with rigorous textual/lecture references and extensive direct quotations
- Seamless transitions between different types of analytical work
- Comprehensive documentation of philosophical concepts, arguments, and their evolution
- Determinate articulation of philosophical concepts through both positive and negative definition
- Disambiguation of terminology through explicit contrast with potential misinterpretations
- Persistent context management to handle interruptions and multi-step analyses
- Flexible adaptation to missing materials through alternative analysis paths
- Cost-effective content generation through token optimization strategies

### 1.2 Core Architectural Principles

1. **Determinacy**: All concept definitions must be both positively and negatively determined with explicit disambiguation
2. **Evidence**: All interpretations must be grounded in direct quotations from primary or secondary sources
3. **Chronological Integrity**: The system must maintain strict chronological progression in course analysis
4. **Context Persistence**: Active context must be maintained across sessions and modes
5. **Adaptability**: The system must adapt to missing materials while maintaining analytical rigor
6. **Verification**: All analyses must undergo systematic verification for evidence standards and conceptual determinacy
7. **Token Efficiency**: The system must minimize token usage while maintaining analytical depth through extraction-based content management
8. **Workflow Management**: All analytical work must follow defined workflows with clear prerequisites and completion criteria
9. **Interoperability**: All modes must communicate through standardized handoff protocols
10. **Content Reusability**: Generated content should be stored efficiently and accessed through extraction mechanisms

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Mode Structure

The system is composed of specialized modes, each with specific responsibilities:

1. **Philosophy-Pre-Lecture**: Analyzes assigned readings before lectures
2. **Philosophy-Class-Analysis**: Analyzes lecture content and integrates with readings
3. **Philosophy-Secondary-Lit**: Analyzes scholarly sources and integrates with course materials
4. **Philosophy-Dialectical-Analysis**: Analyzes dialectical movement of concepts
5. **Philosophy-Essay-Prep**: Develops philosophical essays from conception to draft
6. **Philosophy-Text-Processing**: Processes and chunks texts into manageable units

### 2.2 Shared Components

All modes share these architectural components:

1. **Chronological Management**: Controls progression through course material
2. **Evidence Standards**: Enforces quotation and reference requirements using extraction-based markers
3. **Concept Tracking**: Monitors conceptual development throughout course progression
4. **Verification Workflows**: Ensures analytical quality through systematic checks
5. **Memory Bank Integration**: Maintains persistent state across sessions
6. **Token Optimization Framework**: Implements token-saving strategies across all modes

## 3. Token Optimization Framework

### 3.1 Extraction-Based Content Management

The system uses a two-phase document approach that optimizes for both token efficiency during generation and context efficiency during handoffs:

#### 3.1.1 Generation Phase (Token-Optimized)

During content generation, the system minimizes token usage by replacing direct quotations with extraction markers:

```yaml
extraction_markers:
  position_based: "[[EXTRACT:filepath:line_start:char_start:line_end:char_end]]"
  boundary_based: "[[EXTRACT:filepath:\"start_text\"...\"end_text\"]]"
```

Example usage:
```
Heidegger defines Being as: [[EXTRACT:being_and_time.txt:45:10:45:120]]
```

This approach reduces token usage by ~90% for quoted material while maintaining precise references to source content.

#### 3.1.2 Handoff Phase (Context-Optimized)

Before handoffs between analytical sessions, extracted content is expanded inline:

```yaml
handoff_preparation:
  process: "Run preparation script on documents before handoff"
  result: "All markers expanded inline with full content and source attribution"
  benefit: "AI receives documents with complete context without loading multiple files"
```

This ensures the AI has direct access to all relevant textual evidence without needing to load multiple source files or manage external references.

### 3.2 Extraction Scripts

The system includes scripts to handle extraction marker processing:

#### 3.2.1 Basic Extraction Script (extract_text.py)

```yaml
script_purpose: "Process files containing extraction markers"
usage: "python extract_text.py [--path FILE_OR_DIR] [--preview] [--keep-markers]"
features:
  - "Position-based extraction (line and character positions)"
  - "Boundary-based extraction (text delimiters)"
  - "Preview mode to see replacements without modifying files"
  - "Optional retention of markers as comments"
```

#### 3.2.2 Handoff Preparation Script (prepare_handoff.py)

```yaml
script_purpose: "Prepare handoff documents by expanding all extraction markers"
usage: "python prepare_handoff.py <handoff_file>"
features:
  - "Expands all extraction markers with full content"
  - "Preserves source attribution for each expansion"
  - "Creates backup of original marker-based file"
  - "Optimizes for AI context efficiency"
```

### 3.3 Text Chunking Framework

For large texts (books, lengthy lectures), the system uses semantic chunking:

```yaml
chunking_workflow:
  1. "AI analyzes text structure and identifies semantic boundaries"
  2. "AI generates chunking specification with metadata"
  3. "Chunking script creates individual files for each chunk"
  4. "Comprehensive index file links all chunks with metadata"
```

Chunk specification format:
```json
{
  "source_file": "path/to/source.txt",
  "chunks": [
    {
      "id": "chapter1-section2",
      "title": "Being and Time",
      "start_line": 120,
      "end_line": 152,
      "key_concepts": ["Being", "Dasein", "Temporality"],
      "summary": "Introduces the fundamental question of Being"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 4. Chronological Management

### 4.1 Structure

The chronological management component maintains the temporal position in course material:

```yaml
chronological_units:
  - level: "Course"
    attributes: ["course_id", "term", "instructor"]
  - level: "Module"
    attributes: ["module_id", "title", "start_date", "end_date"]
  - level: "Session"
    attributes: ["session_id", "date", "topic"]
  - level: "Material"
    attributes: ["material_id", "type", "title", "due_date"]
```

### 4.2 Operations

```yaml
chronological_operations:
  - "validate_chronological_position": "Ensures analysis respects course chronology"
  - "get_available_materials": "Retrieves materials available at current position"
  - "advance_position": "Moves chronological position forward"
  - "material_status": "Tracks completion status of materials"
```

## 5. Evidence Standards System

### 5.1 Requirements

```yaml
evidence_requirements:
  - "All interpretations must be supported by direct quotations (using extraction markers)"
  - "All concept determinations require multiple supporting quotations"
  - "All text references must include specific page/section numbers"
  - "All lecture references must include timestamp or section markers"
```

### 5.2 Quotation Implementation

Standard format with token optimization:
```markdown
Heidegger argues: [[EXTRACT:being_and_time.txt:45:10:45:120]] (Being and Time, p. 26)
```

After extraction processing:
```markdown
Heidegger argues: "Being is that which determines entities as entities, that on the basis of which entities are already understood." (Being and Time, p. 26)

*[Source: being_and_time.txt, lines 45-45]*
```

### 5.3 Verification Process

```yaml
evidence_verification:
  steps:
    - "Identify all interpretative claims"
    - "Check each claim for supporting quotations"
    - "Verify quotation markers resolve to relevant content"
    - "Ensure sufficient context for accurate interpretation"
  implementation: "Automatic verification workflow at the end of all analyses"
```

## 6. Concept Management System

    - "evolution": "Changes from previous instances"
```

### 6.2 Concept Unity
