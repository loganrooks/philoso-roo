[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE][PRE-LECTURE]

<thinking>
1. The user wants to initialize pre-lecture analysis workflow
2. Need to first check chronological integrity and determine next analysis target
3. Observed file structure shows:
   - Previous lecture materials in Readings/ organized by date
   - Latest readings appear to be in Feb25/
   - Course materials include Science of Logic and Philosophy of Nature
4. Need to:
   1. Check/create analysis workspace structure
   2. Initialize chronological tracking
   3. Identify next lecture requiring analysis
   4. Review syllabus for upcoming lecture details

Let's start by checking if we have a chronological index file and create it if needed

1. The analysis_logs directory exists but is empty
2. Need to create chronological index to track analysis status
3. Before creating index, should check syllabus for course schedule

13 | ## Course Description  
14 | This course will be an introduction to the philosophy of G.W.F. Hegel (1770–1831). We will read selections from Hegel’s writings that constitute his philosophical "system": the *Phenomenology of Spirit* (as the introduction to the system) and the *Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences* (the system itself), including its three parts: logic/metaphysics, philosophy of nature, and philosophy of spirit. Time permitting, we will also explore supplementary texts such as the *Science of Logic*, *Philosophy of Right*, and Hegel’s lectures on religion, aesthetics, and history.  
15 | 
16 | The course emphasizes:  
17 | - Hegel’s concept of a philosophical system.  
18 | - Why philosophy, for Hegel, must take systematic form.  
19 | - The structure of the system as a "circle of circles" (each part forming its own circular structure within the whole).  
20 | 
21 | *Note:* The only formal prerequisite is **PHL 210** (concurrent enrollment is sufficient), but students are strongly encouraged to complete **PHL 314 (Kant)** beforehand.  
22 |

24 | 
25 | ## Assignments & Marking  
26 | - **Reading:** Complete all readings **in full** before class. Re-read after lectures for deeper understanding.  
27 | - **Daily Questions:** Submit **two** written questions (2–3 sentences each) at the start of each class. Questions must contextualize the reading (e.g., "Given Hegel says...").  
28 |   - Participation grade (10%) depends on submitting questions. No late submissions.  
29 | - **Essays & Exam:**  
30 |   - Two essays (2000 words each, 25% each).  
31 |   - Comprehensive final exam (40%).  
32 | 
33 | **Final Grade Breakdown:**  
34 | - Participation: 10%  
35 | - 1st Essay: 25%  
36 | - 2nd Essay: 25%  
37 | - Final Exam: 40%

<thinking>
1. Based on syllabus analysis:
   - Today is March 4, 2025 - Lecture Eight
   - Topic: From Animal Life to Spirit
   - Readings: Philosophy of Nature §§375–376, Philosophy of Spirit §§377–386
2. Need to create chronological index tracking:
   - Past lectures (Jan 7 through Feb 25)
   - Current lecture (March 4)
   - Upcoming lectures (March 11 through April 1)
3. Will create analysis_logs/chronological_index.md to track analysis status

<user_message>
You are wrong, you haven't even checked the status of the workspace before you declared everything complete. There is no analysis for 1/7 1/14 1/21 1/28 and a few others, there isn't a lecture for 1/21 and the lecture for 1/28 is incomplete only half. I want you to focus on completing the analyses for January. So go through the workspace, check this information yourself and update the index files.

1. Need to reassess January lectures status by checking:
   - Reading analyses in archive/analysis_workspaceV1/readings/
   - Lecture notes in archive/analysis_workspaceV1/lectures/
   - Transcripts in Transcripts/ directory
2. Found:
   - Jan 7: Has transcripts (01 and 02) and lecture notes (jan7_lecture1.md, jan7_lecture2.md)
   - Jan 14: Has transcript but no lecture notes
   - Jan 21: Has readings but no transcript or lecture notes
   - Jan 28: Has partial transcript (02) suggesting incomplete

Will update chronological index to reflect accurate status

 1 | ## INTRODUCTION
 2 | 73. It is a natural assumption that in philosophy, before we start to deal with its proper subject-matter, viz. the actual cognition of what truly is, one must first of all come to an understanding about cognition, which is regarded either as the instrument to get hold of the Absolute, or as the medium through which one discovers it. A certain uneasiness seems justified, partly because there are different types of cognition, and one of them might be more appropriate than another for the attainment of this goal, so that we could make a bad choice of means; and partly because cognition is a faculty of a definite kind and scope, and thus, without a more precise definition of its nature and limits, we might grasp clouds of error instead of the heaven of truth. This feeling of uneasiness is surely bound to be transformed into the conviction that the whole project of securing for consciousness through cognition what exists in itself is absurd, and that there is a boundary between cognition and the Absolute that completely separates them. For, if cognition is the instrument for getting hold of absolute being, it is obvious that the use of an instrument on a thing certainly does not let it be what it is for itself, but rather sets out to reshape and alter it. If, on the other hand, cognition is not an instrument of our activity but a more or less passive medium through which the light of truth reaches us, then again we do not receive the truth as it is in itself, but only as it exists through and in this medium. Either way we employ a means which immediately brings about the opposite of its own end; or rather, what is really absurd is that we should make use of a means at all.
 3 | 
 4 | It would seem, to be sure, that this evil could be remedied through an acquaintance with the way in which the instrument works; for this would enable us to eliminate from the representation of the Absolute which we have gained through it whatever is due to the instrument, and thus get the truth in its purity. But this ‘improvement’ would in fact only bring us back to where we were before. If we remove from a reshaped thing what the instrument has done to it, then the thing—here the Absolute—becomes for us exactly what it was before this [accordingly] superfluous effort. On the other hand, if the Absolute is supposed merely to be brought nearer to us through this instrument, without anything in it being altered, like a bird caught by a lime-twig, it would surely laugh our little ruse to scorn, if it were not with us, in and for itself, all along, and of its own volition. For a ruse is just what cognition would be in such a case, since it would, with its manifold exertions, be giving itself the air of doing something quite different from creating a merely immediate and therefore effortless relationship. Or, if by testing cognition, which we conceive of as a medium, we get to know the law of its refraction, it is again useless to subtract this from the end result. For it is not the refraction of the ray, but the ray itself whereby truth reaches us, that is cognition; and if this were removed, all that would be indicated would be a pure direction or a blank space.
 5 | 
 6 | 74. Meanwhile, if the fear of falling into error sets up a mistrust of Science, which in the absence of such scruples gets on with the work itself, and actually cognizes something, it is hard to see why we should not turn round and mistrust this very mistrust. Should we not be concerned as to whether this fear of error is not just the error itself? Indeed, this fear takes something—a great deal in fact—for granted as truth, supporting its scruples and inferences on what is itself in need of prior scrutiny to see if it is true. To be specific, it takes for granted certain ideas about cognition as an instrument and as a medium, and assumes that there is a difference between ourselves and this cognition. Above all, it presupposes that the Absolute stands on one side and cognition on the other, independent and separated from it, and yet is something real; or in other words, it presupposes that cognition which, since it is excluded from the Absolute, is surely outside of the truth as well, is nevertheless true, an assumption whereby what calls itself fear of error reveals itself rather as fear of the truth.
 7 | 
 8 | 75. This conclusion stems from the fact that the Absolute alone is true, or the truth alone is absolute. One may set this aside on the grounds that there is a type of cognition which, though it does not cognize the Absolute as Science aims to, is still true, and that cognition in general, though it be incapable of grasping the Absolute, is still capable of grasping other kinds of truth. But we gradually come to see that this kind of talk which goes back and forth only leads to a hazy distinction between an absolute truth and some other kind of truth, and that words like ‘absolute’, ‘cognition’, etc. presuppose a meaning which has yet to be ascertained.
 9 | 
10 | 76. Instead of troubling ourselves with such useless ideas and locutions about cognition as ‘an instrument for getting hold of the Absolute’, or as ‘a medium through which we view the truth’ (relationships which surely, in the end, are what all these ideas of a cognition cut off from the Absolute, and an Absolute separated from cognition, amount to); instead of putting up with excuses which create the incapacity of Science by assuming relationships of this kind in order to be exempt from the hard work of Science, while at the same time giving the impression of working seriously and zealously; instead of bothering to refute all these ideas, we could reject them out of hand as adventitious and arbitrary, and the words associated with them like ‘absolute’, ‘cognition’, ‘objective’ and ‘subjective’, and countless others whose meaning is assumed to be generally familiar, could even be regarded as so much deception. For to give the impression that their meaning is generally well known, or that their Notion is comprehended, looks more like an attempt to avoid the main problem, which is precisely to provide this Notion. We could, with better justification, simply spare ourselves the trouble of paying any attention whatever to such ideas and locutions; for they are intended to ward off Science itself, and constitute merely an empty appearance of knowing, which vanishes immediately as soon as Science comes on the scene. But Science, just because it comes on the scene, is itself an appearance: in coming on the scene it is not yet Science in its developed and unfolded truth. In this connection it makes no difference whether we think of Science as the appearance because it comes on the scene alongside another mode of knowledge, or whether we call that other untrue knowledge its manifestation. In any case Science must liberate itself from this semblance, and it can do so only by turning against it. For, when confronted with a knowledge that is without truth, Science can neither merely reject it as an ordinary way of looking at things, while assuring us that its Science is a quite different sort of cognition for which that ordinary knowledge is of no account whatever; nor can it appeal to the vulgar view for the intimations it gives us of something better to come. By the former assurance, Science would be declaring its power to lie simply in its being; but the untrue knowledge likewise appeals to the fact that it is, and assures us that for it Science is of no account. One bare assurance is worth just as much as another. Still less can Science appeal to whatever intimations of something better it may detect in the cognition that is without truth, to the signs which point in the direction of Science. For one thing, it would only be appealing again to what merely is; and for another, it would only be appealing to itself, and to itself in the mode in which it exists in the cognition that is without truth. In other words, it would be appealing to an inferior form of its being, to the way it appears, rather than to what it is in and for itself. It is for this reason that an exposition of how knowledge makes its appearance will here be undertaken.
11 | 
12 | 77. Now, because it has only phenomenal knowledge for its object, this exposition seems not to be Science, free and self-moving in its own peculiar shape; yet from this standpoint it can be regarded as the path of the natural consciousness which presses forward to true knowledge; or as the way of the Soul which journeys through the series of its own configurations as though they were the stations appointed for it by its own nature,7 so that it may purify itself for the life of the Spirit, and achieve finally, through a completed experience of itself, the awareness of what it really is in itself.
13 | 
14 | [7] An allusion perhaps to the Stations of the Cross.
15 | 
16 | 78. Natural consciousness will show itself to be only the Notion of knowledge, or in other words, not to be real knowledge. But since it directly takes itself to be real knowledge, this path has a negative significance for it, and what is in fact the realization of the Notion, counts for it rather as the loss of its own self; for it does lose its truth on this path. The road can therefore be regarded as the pathway of doubt, or more precisely as the way of despair. For what happens on it is not what is ordinarily understood when the word ‘doubt’ is used: shilly-shallying about this or that presumed truth, followed by a return to that truth again, after the doubt has been appropriately dispelled—so that at the end of the process the matter is taken to be what it was in the first place. On the contrary, this path is the conscious insight into the untruth of phenomenal knowledge, for which the supreme reality is what is in truth only the unrealized Notion. Therefore this thoroughgoing scepticism is also not the scepticism with which an earnest zeal for truth and Science fancies it has prepared and equipped itself in their service: the resolve, in Science, not to give oneself over to the thoughts of others, upon mere authority, but to examine everything for oneself and follow only one’s own conviction, or better still, to produce everything oneself, and accept only one’s own deed as what is true.
17 | 
18 | The series of configurations which consciousness goes through along this road is, in reality, the detailed history of the education of consciousness itself to the standpoint of Science. That zealous resolve represents this education simplistically as something directly over and done with in the making of the resolution; but the way of the Soul is the actual fulfilment of the resolution, in contrast to the untruth of that view. Now, following one’s own conviction is, of course, more than giving oneself over to authority; but changing an opinion accepted on authority into an opinion held out of personal conviction, does not necessarily alter the content of the opinion, or replace error with truth. The only difference between being caught up in a system of opinions and prejudices based on personal conviction, and being caught up in one based on the authority of others, lies in the added conceit that is innate in the former position. The scepticism that is directed against the whole range of phenomenal consciousness, on the other hand, renders the Spirit for the first time competent to examine what truth is. For it brings about a state of despair about all the so-called natural ideas, thoughts, and opinions, regardless of whether they are called one’s own or someone else’s, ideas with which the consciousness that sets about the examination [of truth] straight away is still filled and hampered, so that it is, in fact, incapable of carrying out what it wants to undertake.
19 | 
20 | 79. The necessary progression and interconnection of the forms of the unreal consciousness will by itself bring to pass the completion of the series. To make this more intelligible, it may be remarked, in a preliminary and general way, that the exposition of the untrue consciousness in its untruth is not a merely negative procedure. The natural consciousness itself normally takes this one-sided view of it; and a knowledge which makes this one-sidedness its very essence is itself one of the patterns of incomplete consciousness which occurs on the road itself, and will manifest itself in due course. This is just the scepticism which only ever sees pure nothingness in its result and abstracts from the fact that this nothingness is specifically the nothingness of that from which it results. For it is only when it is taken as the result of that from which it emerges, that it is, in fact, the true result; in that case it is itself a determinate nothingness, one which has a content. The scepticism that ends up with the bare abstraction of nothingness or emptiness cannot get any further from there, but must wait to see whether something new comes along and what it is, in order to throw it too into the same empty abyss. But when, on the other hand, the result is conceived as it is in truth, namely, as a determinate negation, a new form has thereby immediately arisen, and in the negation the transition is made through which the progress through the complete series of forms comes about of itself.
21 | 
22 | 80. But the goal is as necessarily fixed for knowledge as the serial progression; it is the point where knowledge no longer needs to go beyond itself, where knowledge finds itself, where Notion corresponds to object and object to Notion. Hence the progress towards this goal is also unhalting, and short of it no satisfaction is to be found at any of the stations on the way. Whatever is confined within the limits of a natural life cannot by its own efforts go beyond its immediate existence; but it is driven beyond it by something else, and this uprooting entails its death. Consciousness, however, is explicitly the Notion of itself. Hence it is something that goes beyond limits, and since these limits are its own, it is something that goes beyond itself. With the positing of a single particular the beyond is also established for consciousness, even if it is only alongside the limited object as in the case of spatial intuition. Thus consciousness suffers this violence at its own hands: it spoils its own limited satisfaction. When consciousness feels this violence, its anxiety may well make it retreat from the truth, and strive to hold on to what it is in danger of losing. But it can find no peace. If it wishes to remain in a state of unthinking inertia, then thought troubles its thoughtlessness, and its own unrest disturbs its inertia. Or, if it entrenches itself in sentimentality, which assures us that it finds everything to be good in its kind, then this assurance likewise suffers violence at the hands of Reason, for, precisely in so far as something is merely a kind, Reason finds it not to be good. Or, again, its fear of the truth may lead consciousness to hide, from itself and others, behind the pretension that its burning zeal for truth makes it difficult or even impossible to find any other truth but the unique truth of vanity—that of being at any rate cleverer than any thoughts that one gets by oneself or from others. This conceit which understands how to belittle every truth, in order to turn back into itself and gloat over its own understanding, which knows how to dissolve every thought and always find the same barren Ego instead of any content—this is a satisfaction which we must leave to itself, for it flees from the universal, and seeks only to be for itself.
23 | 
24 | 81. In addition to these preliminary general remarks about the manner and the necessity of the progression, it may be useful to say something about the method of carrying out the inquiry. If this exposition is viewed as a way of relating Science to phenomenal knowledge, and as an investigation and examination of the reality of cognition, it would seem that it cannot take place without some presupposition which can serve as its underlying criterion. For an examination consists in applying an accepted standard, and in determining whether something is right or wrong on the basis of the resulting agreement or disagreement of the thing examined; thus the standard as such (and Science likewise if it were the criterion) is accepted as the essence or as the in-itself. But here, where Science has just begun to come on the scene, neither Science nor anything else has yet justified itself as the essence or the in-itself; and without something of the sort it seems that no examination can take place.
25 | 
26 | 82. This contradiction and its removal will become more definite if we call to mind the abstract determinations of truth and knowledge as they occur in consciousness. Consciousness simultaneously distinguishes itself from something, and at the same time relates itself to it, or, as it is said, this something exists for consciousness; and the determinate aspect of this relating, or of the being of something for a consciousness, is knowing. But we distinguish this being-for-another from being-in-itself; whatever is related to knowledge or knowing is also distinguished from it, and posited as existing outside of this relationship; this being-in-itself is called truth. Just what might be involved in these determinations is of no further concern to us here. Since our object is phenomenal knowledge, its determinations too will at first be taken directly as they present themselves; and they do present themselves very much as we have already apprehended them.
27 | 
28 | 83. Now, if we inquire into the truth of knowledge, it seems that we are asking what knowledge is in itself. Yet in this inquiry knowledge is our object, something that exists for us; and the in-itself that would supposedly result from it would rather be the being of knowledge for us. What we asserted to be its essence would be not so much its truth but rather just our knowledge of it. The essence or criterion would lie within ourselves, and that which was to be compared with it and about which a decision would be reached through this comparison would not necessarily have to recognize the validity of such a standard.
29 | 
30 | 84. But the dissociation, or this semblance of dissociation and presupposition, is overcome by the nature of the object we are investigating. Consciousness provides its own criterion from within itself, so that the investigation becomes a comparison of consciousness with itself; for the distinction made above falls within it. In consciousness one thing exists for another, i.e. consciousness regularly contains the determinateness of the moment of knowledge; at the same time, this other is to consciousness not merely for it, but is also outside of this relationship, or exists in itself: the moment of truth. Thus in what consciousness affirms from within itself as being-in-itself or the True we have the standard which consciousness itself sets up by which to measure what it knows. If we designate knowledge as the Notion, but the essence or the True as what exists, or the object, then the examination consists in seeing whether the Notion corresponds to the object. But if we call the essence or in-itself of the object the Notion, and on the other hand understand by the object the Notion itself as object, viz. as it exists for an other, then the examination consists in seeing whether the object corresponds to its Notion. It is evident, of course, that the two procedures are the same. But the essential point to bear in mind throughout the whole investigation is that these two moments, ‘Notion’ and ‘object’, ‘being-for-another’ and ‘being-in-itself’, both fall within that knowledge which we are investigating.
31 | 
32 | Consequently, we do not need to import criteria, or to make use of our own bright ideas and thoughts during the course of the inquiry; it is precisely when we leave these aside that we succeed in contemplating the matter in hand as it is in and for itself.
33 | 
34 | 85. But not only is a contribution by us superfluous, since Notion and object, the criterion and what is to be tested, are present in consciousness itself, but we are also spared the trouble of comparing the two and really testing them, so that, since what consciousness examines is its own self, all that is left for us to do is simply to look on. For consciousness is, on the one hand, consciousness of the object, and on the other, consciousness of itself; consciousness of what for it is the True, and consciousness of its knowledge of the truth. Since both are for the same consciousness, this consciousness is itself their comparison; it is for this same consciousness to know whether its knowledge of the object corresponds to the object or not. The object, it is true, seems only to be for consciousness in the way that consciousness knows it; it seems that consciousness cannot, as it were, get behind the object as it exists for consciousness so as to examine what the object is in itself, and hence, too, cannot test its own knowledge by that standard. But the distinction between the in-itself and knowledge is already present in the very fact that consciousness knows an object at all. Something is for it the in-itself; and knowledge, or the being of the object for consciousness, is, for it, another moment. Upon this distinction, which is present as a fact, the examination rests. If the comparison shows that these two moments do not correspond to one another, it would seem that consciousness must alter its knowledge to make it conform to the object. But, in fact, in the alteration of the knowledge, the object itself alters for it too, for the knowledge that was present was essentially a knowledge of the object: as the knowledge changes, so too does the object, for it essentially belonged to this knowledge. Hence it comes to pass for consciousness that what it previously took to be the in-itself is not an in-itself, or that it was only an in-itself for consciousness. Since consciousness thus finds that its knowledge does not correspond to its object, the object itself does not stand the test; in other words, the criterion for testing is altered when that for which it was to have been the criterion fails to pass the test; and the testing is not only a testing of what we know, but also a testing of the criterion of what knowing is.
35 | 
36 | 86. Inasmuch as the new true object issues from it, this dialectical movement which consciousness exercises on itself and which affects both its knowledge and its object, is precisely what is called experience [Erfahrung]. In this connection there is a moment in the process just mentioned which must be brought out more clearly, for through it a new light will be thrown on the exposition which follows. Consciousness knows something; this object is the essence or the in-itself; but it is also for consciousness the in-itself. This is where the ambiguity of this truth enters. We see that consciousness now has two objects: one is the first in-itself, the second is the being-for-consciousness of this in-itself. The latter appears at first sight to be merely the reflection of consciousness into itself, i.e. what consciousness has in mind is not an object, but only its knowledge of that first object. But, as was shown previously, the first object, in being known, is altered for consciousness; it ceases to be the in-itself, and becomes something that is the in-itself only for consciousness. And this then is the True: the being-for-consciousness of this in-itself. Or, in other words, this is the essence, or the object of consciousness. This new object contains the nothingness of the first, it is what experience has made of it.
37 | 
38 | 87. This exposition of the course of experience contains a moment in virtue of which it does not seem to agree with what is ordinarily understood by experience. This is the moment of transition from the first object and the knowledge of it, to the other object, which experience is said to be about. Our account implied that our knowledge of the first object, or the being-for-consciousness of the first in-itself, itself becomes the second object. It usually seems to be the case, on the contrary, that our experience of the untruth of our first notion comes by way of a second object which we come upon by chance and externally, so that our part in all this is simply the pure apprehension of what is in and for itself. From the present viewpoint, however, the new object shows itself to have come about through a reversal of consciousness itself. This way of looking at the matter is something contributed by us, by means of which the succession of experiences through which consciousness passes is raised into a scientific progression—but it is not known to the consciousness that we are observing. But, as a matter of fact, we have here the same situation as the one discussed in regard to the relation between our exposition and scepticism, viz. that in every case the result of an untrue mode of knowledge must not be allowed to run away into an empty nothing, but must necessarily be grasped as the nothing of that from which it results—a result which contains what was true in the preceding knowledge. It shows up here like this: since what first appeared as the object sinks for consciousness to the level of its way of knowing it, and since the in-itself becomes a being-for-consciousness of the in-itself, the latter is now the new object. Herewith a new pattern of consciousness comes on the scene as well, for which the essence is something different from what it was at the preceding stage. It is this fact that guides the entire series of the patterns of consciousness in their necessary sequence. But it is just this necessity itself, or the origination of the new object, that presents itself to consciousness without its understanding how this happens, which proceeds for us, as it were, behind the back of consciousness. Thus in the movement of consciousness there occurs a moment of being-in-itself or being-for-us which is not present to the consciousness comprehended in the experience itself. The content, however, of what presents itself to us does exist for it; we comprehend only the formal aspect of that content, or its pure origination. For it, what has thus arisen exists only as an object; for us, it appears at the same time as movement and a process of becoming.
39 | 
40 | 88. Because of this necessity, the way to Science is itself already Science, and hence, in virtue of its content, is the Science of the experience of consciousness.
41 | 
42 | 89. The experience of itself which consciousness goes through can, in accordance with its Notion, comprehend nothing less than the entire system of consciousness, or the entire realm of the truth of Spirit. For this reason, the moments of this truth are exhibited in their own proper determinateness, viz. as being not abstract moments, but as they are for consciousness, or as consciousness itself stands forth in its relation to them. Thus the moments of the whole are patterns of consciousness. In pressing forward to its true existence, consciousness will arrive at a point at which it gets rid of its semblance of being burdened with something alien, with what is only for it, and some sort of ‘other’, at a point where appearance becomes identical with essence, so that its exposition will coincide at just this point with the authentic Science of Spirit. And finally, when consciousness itself grasps this its own essence, it will signify the nature of absolute knowledge itself.

<content># Pre-Lecture Reading: Phenomenology of Spirit - Introduction

## Basic Information
- **Author**: G.W.F. Hegel
- **Date/Period**: 1807
- **Assigned For**: January 7, 2025
- **Pages/Sections**: Introduction (§73-89)

## Initial Engagement
The Introduction presents Hegel's methodological framework for the Phenomenology, focusing on the problem of how consciousness can examine itself and achieve true knowledge. The text challenges traditional epistemological assumptions about the separation between knowledge and its object.

## Key Passages
```
It is a natural assumption that in philosophy, before we start to deal with its proper subject-matter, viz. the actual cognition of what truly is, one must first of all come to an understanding about cognition, which is regarded either as the instrument to get hold of the Absolute, or as the medium through which one discovers it.
```
**Significance**: Sets up the central problem of the Introduction - the apparent need to understand cognition before using it, and the paradox this creates.

```
Natural consciousness will show itself to be only the Notion of knowledge, or in other words, not to be real knowledge. But since it directly takes itself to be real knowledge, this path has a negative significance for it, and what is in fact the realization of the Notion, counts for it rather as the loss of its own self; for it does lose its truth on this path.
```
**Significance**: Introduces the concept of natural consciousness's self-negating journey to true knowledge.

## Central Concepts
1. **Natural Consciousness**: Initial, unreflective form of knowing that must undergo a transformative journey
2. **The Absolute**: Ultimate truth/reality that consciousness seeks to know
3. **Experience (Erfahrung)**: Dialectical movement where both consciousness and its object transform
4. **Phenomenal Knowledge**: The appearing of knowledge in consciousness's developmental stages

## Potential Arguments
1. The impossibility of examining cognition as an instrument without already using cognition
2. The necessity of consciousness's self-examination through experience
3. The inseparability of the examination process from the development of truth itself

## Historical Context
Written as introduction to Phenomenology of Spirit, Hegel's first major work. Responds to Kantian epistemological concerns while proposing a radically different approach to the problem of knowledge.

## Difficult Sections
```
Since consciousness thus finds that its knowledge does not correspond to its object, the object itself does not stand the test... and the testing is not only a testing of what we know, but also a testing of the criterion of what knowing is.
```
**Difficulty**: Complex dialectical movement where both knowledge and its criterion change
**Potential Interpretation**: Suggests that standards of truth evolve with consciousness's development

## Questions for Lecture
1. How does Hegel's concept of experience differ from empirical notions of experience?
2. What role does negation play in consciousness's development?
3. How does Hegel's approach differ from traditional epistemological investigations?
4. What makes this a "pathway of doubt" or "way of despair"?

## Hypotheses about Lecture Content
1. Lecture will likely focus on explaining the methodological significance of the Introduction for understanding the entire Phenomenology
2. Will need to clarify the relationship between phenomenal knowledge and absolute knowing
3. May connect this methodological framework to specific examples from later in the work

## Connections to Previous Materials
Text introduces fundamental concepts that will structure the entire course's engagement with Hegel's system. As first lecture, establishes methodological framework for reading Hegel.

## Personal Reflections
The Introduction's critique of treating cognition as an instrument challenges basic assumptions about philosophical methodology. The text suggests that understanding comes through the process of examination itself rather than through preliminary methodological preparations.</content>

<content># Questions for January 7 Lecture - Introduction to PhS

## Conceptual Clarification Questions
1. How does Hegel define "experience" (Erfahrung) in contrast to ordinary understanding of the term?
2. What exactly is the relationship between "natural consciousness" and "scientific consciousness"?
3. What does Hegel mean by the "in-itself" and "for-itself" distinction in consciousness?

## Interpretive Questions
1. Why does Hegel characterize the phenomenological journey as a "pathway of doubt" and "way of despair"?
2. How should we understand the claim that consciousness "provides its own criterion from within itself"?
3. In what sense is the way to Science "itself already Science"?

## Critical Questions
1. Is Hegel's critique of treating cognition as an instrument/medium convincing?
2. Does the self-examining nature of consciousness really avoid the problem of criterion?
3. How does Hegel justify the necessity of the progression of consciousness's shapes?

## Comparative Questions
1. How does Hegel's approach to the problem of knowledge differ from Kant's transcendental method?
2. What distinguishes Hegel's skepticism from traditional philosophical skepticism?
3. How does his concept of truth differ from correspondence or coherence theories?

## Application Questions
1. How might Hegel's notion of experience help us understand learning processes in general?
2. Can his critique of treating cognition as an instrument apply to contemporary epistemological debates?
3. What implications does his method have for how we should approach philosophical investigation?

## Meta-Questions
1. Why does Hegel begin the Phenomenology with these methodological considerations?
2. How does the Introduction's method reflect the content it discusses?
3. What role does this Introduction play in the larger structure of Hegel's philosophical system?

## Priority Questions for Class Discussion
1. What exactly happens in the dialectical movement where both knowledge and its criterion change?
2. How can consciousness examine itself without presupposing what it's trying to prove?
3. Why must the journey of consciousness follow a necessary progression?

<content># Conceptual Development Hypotheses - PhS Introduction

## Initial Concept Map

### Core Concepts
1. Consciousness
   - Natural consciousness (starting point)
   - Scientific consciousness (goal)
   - Self-examining consciousness (method)

2. Knowledge
   - Phenomenal knowledge
   - Absolute knowledge
   - The process of knowing

3. Truth
   - In-itself
   - For-consciousness
   - Absolute truth

4. Experience (Erfahrung)
   - Dialectical movement
   - Negation
   - Development

## Current Understanding

### Consciousness
- Begins as natural, unreflective consciousness
- Contains both knowledge and truth-criterion within itself
- Undergoes self-transformation through experience
- Currently understood as both subject and object of investigation

### Knowledge
- Initially appears as immediate knowing
- Transforms through recognition of inadequacy
- Develops through dialectical movement
- Currently understood as inseparable from its object

### Truth
- Not a fixed, external standard
- Develops through consciousness's experience
- Involves unity of in-itself and for-consciousness
- Currently understood as process rather than state

### Experience
- Not mere empirical observation
- Involves dialectical transformation
- Changes both consciousness and its object
- Currently understood as method of development

## Development Hypotheses

1. **Consciousness Development**
   - Will likely move from natural to scientific through necessary stages
   - Each stage will reveal inadequacies in previous understanding
   - Final form may involve unity of subject and object

2. **Knowledge Evolution**
   - Will develop through recognition of limitations
   - May show progressive integration of knower and known
   - Could reveal necessary connection to absolute knowing

3. **Truth Transformation**
   - May show development from fixed to dynamic conception
   - Could reveal internal relation to consciousness
   - Might demonstrate unity of process and result

4. **Experience Elaboration**
   - Will likely reveal more complex structure than initially apparent
   - May show necessary connection to consciousness's development
   - Could demonstrate systematic nature of phenomenological method

## Anticipated Connections

1. **Between Concepts**
   - Experience mediates between consciousness and knowledge
   - Truth emerges through consciousness's self-examination
   - Knowledge develops through experiential movement

2. **To Later Development**
   - Introduction's method shapes entire Phenomenology
   - Concepts will likely gain concrete content
   - Structure may repeat at higher levels

## Questions to Track

1. How does each stage of consciousness necessitate the next?
2. What is the relationship between experience and absolute knowing?
3. How does truth develop while remaining truth?
4. What makes the progression necessary rather than contingent?

## Potential Problems

1. **Methodological Tensions**
   - How to begin without presuppositions
   - Relationship between phenomenology and system
   - Role of the philosophical observer

2. **Conceptual Challenges**
   - Nature of dialectical necessity
   - Status of absolute knowing
   - Relationship between appearance and reality

## Integration Points

1. **With Previous Knowledge**
   - Kant's transcendental method
   - Skeptical traditions
   - Systematic philosophy

2. **With Course Themes**
   - Role of introduction in philosophical works
   - Nature of philosophical methodology
   - Relationship between method and content</content>

    A[Natural Consciousness] -->|through| B[Experience/Erfahrung]
    B -->|produces| C[Scientific Consciousness]

```

## Key Relationships

### Primary Dialectical Movement
- Natural Consciousness ↔ Experience ↔ Scientific Consciousness
  * Natural consciousness encounters limitations
  * Experience transforms both consciousness and object
  * Scientific consciousness emerges through this process

### Knowledge-Object Relation
- Knowledge ↔ Object ↔ Truth
  * Knowledge attempts to grasp object
  * Object reveals inadequacy of knowledge
  * Truth emerges through their interaction

### Consciousness-Truth Development
- Consciousness ↔ Experience ↔ Truth
  * Consciousness examines itself
  * Experience reveals truth through negation
  * Truth develops through necessary stages

## Methodological Structure

1. Starting Point
   - Natural consciousness
   - Immediate knowing
   - Assumed truth

2. Process
   - Self-examination
   - Dialectical movement
   - Experience as transformation

3. Result
   - Scientific consciousness
   - Absolute knowing
   - Systematic truth

## Dynamic Elements

### Transformations
- Knowledge transforms through recognition of inadequacy
- Object changes as knowledge changes
- Truth develops through experience
- Consciousness undergoes self-transformation

### Necessary Connections
- Between stages of development
- Between knowledge and its object
- Between appearance and reality
- Between method and content

## Integration Points

### With Course Themes
- Role of philosophical methodology
- Nature of systematic thinking
- Relationship between knowledge and truth

### With Later Development
- Foundation for phenomenological method
- Structure for examining consciousness
- Framework for systematic philosophy

## Notes for Lecture

1. Focus on:
   - Nature of dialectical movement
   - Role of necessity in development
   - Relationship between method and content

2. Watch for:
   - Concrete examples of dialectical movement
   - Clarification of necessary progression
   - Links to later stages of Phenomenology

3. Key Questions:
   - How does each transformation occur?
   - What makes the progression necessary?
   - How does this method shape the entire work?</content>

[read_file for 'Transcripts/PHL316_hegel_jan7_01.txt'] Result:
   1 | So let me say a few things about the idea of this class.
   2 | So Hegel has always suffered from the problem
   3 | that he is very hard to teach.
   4 | And the reason he is very hard to teach
   5 | is because there is no book by Hegel
   6 | that is the equivalent of the critique of pure reason,
   7 | or the ethics of Spinoza, or the Republic of Plato,
   8 | or Truth is a Human Nature.
   9 | That is to say, a single book that you
  10 | could teach either in the course of a semester,
  11 | or you could teach a significant chunk of a semester,
  12 | that gives you, if not the philosopher's whole system,
  13 | at least enough of it that you can kind of figure out
  14 | how everything fits into it.
  15 | The closest thing in Hegel would be the philosophy of right.
  16 | But that is really only a very small part of Hegel's system.
  17 | The books by Hegel that do contain a more complete
  18 | presentation of the system have this problem
  19 | that they are unbelievably hard to read,
  20 | in particular this one, the Phenomenology of Spirit.
  21 | So the standard way that Hegel gets
  22 | taught at the undergraduate class
  23 | is you teach the Phenomenology of Spirit.
  24 | So in the past when I've taught this class,
  25 | I have done the standard thing.
  26 | You try to read the Phenomenology of Spirit.
  27 | The problem with that is that in one semester,
  28 | you can only really do half of the Phenomenology.
  29 | I never managed to get to the end.
  30 | And the Phenomenology of Spirit is, I think,
  31 | the hardest book in the entire Western philosophical tradition.
  32 | So what has this experience teaching the Phenomenology
  33 | of Spirit that, at a certain point, people aren't really
  34 | reading the book anymore.
  35 | They're just kind of getting a kind of indirect high level
  36 | summary of it.
  37 | And they're kind of talking about Hegel,
  38 | but they're not really talking about what's in the book.
  39 | And that's not just true of students
  40 | in undergraduate classes.
  41 | On Hegel, I sometimes have the impression
  42 | with a lot of so-called Hegel scholars
  43 | that they're not really reading the same book that I am.
  44 | They're kind of like doing this second hand high level
  45 | summary of Hegel.
  46 | So the last time I taught 316, I went the opposite direction.
  47 | We read the Phenomenology of Spirit line by line.
  48 | In fact, in at least one three hour course,
  49 | we didn't get past a single sentence.
  50 | That had the contrary benefit that people were really, really
  51 | reading the text.
  52 | However, it had the complementary problem
  53 | that we didn't get very far.
  54 | And after a certain point, even if you're
  55 | reading it sentence by sentence, Hegel
  56 | is extraordinarily difficult.
  57 | So this class is going to go in the opposite direction.
  58 | The idea of this class is that we're going to do,
  59 | or I'm going to present, the entirety of Hegel's system,
  60 | or at least not the whole thing.
  61 | You can't do the whole thing one semester.
  62 | I'm going to talk about all of the main structural moments
  63 | of Hegel's system.
  64 | And I'll talk about this in more detail, a little bit more
  65 | detail later today, and much more detail in several weeks.
  66 | We're going to talk about the Phenomenology of Spirit, which
  67 | is the introduction to the system, which has three parts,
  68 | logic, philosophy of spirit.
  69 | Sorry, I really should bring my notes with me.
  70 | Philosophy of nature, that's an embarrassing mistake.
  71 | The philosophy of spirit.
  72 | So we're obviously not going to read every part.
  73 | The book that presents this whole thing is called the Psychopedia.
  74 | We're not going to read the entire Encyclopedia.
  75 | That would be ridiculous.
  76 | But we're going to talk about all of the main structural moments
  77 | of this.
  78 | So we're going to spend the first two weeks on the Phenomenology
  79 | of Spirit.
  80 | We're going to spend three, four, five, six, from weeks three
  81 | to six on the logic, which means we're
  82 | going to talk about the beginning.
  83 | And we're going to talk about the end.
  84 | And then we're going to spend a week on the transition
  85 | to the philosophy of nature.
  86 | Then we're going to spend a week talking
  87 | about the move from the philosophy of nature
  88 | to the philosophy of spirit.
  89 | And then we're going to spend one week on the philosophy of right.
  90 | It's week nine.
  91 | We're going to spend, I feel like I've missed a week somewhere
  92 | in here.
  93 | This is not quite accurate.
  94 | But you get the basic picture.
  95 | And then we're going to spend one week on art, one week on religion,
  96 | and then one week on philosophy, which
  97 | is the return of the philosophy of spirit back to the logic.
  98 | So we're not going to cover every single part of the system.
  99 | But we are going to talk about all the major moving parts.
 100 | So the other idea that sort of mixed in with this idea for this course
 101 | is we're going to read all the parts of Hegel you can just read.
 102 | We're going to read all the easy parts of it.
 103 | And we're going to read them in systematic order
 104 | so that you have some idea of what Hegel's philosophical system actually
 105 | is.
 106 | The other problem with reading the phenomenology of spirit,
 107 | the other problem with treating the phenomenology of spirit
 108 | as like the textbook for an undergraduate Hegel course,
 109 | is I'll talk about this more later today and more next week.
 110 | The phenomenology of spirit is in a certain way,
 111 | although this requires qualifications, only Hegel's negative view.
 112 | It should bear the subtitle wrong answers only.
 113 | So the phenomenology of spirit is a series of failed attempts,
 114 | failed accounts of what knowledge is.
 115 | So it's just very weird that this book has become treated
 116 | as the critique of pure reason of Hegel.
 117 | That is just, I mean, Hegel would be totally shocked
 118 | that this is the book that everyone reads,
 119 | because it's basically his jubinellia.
 120 | And he wasn't even really sure what to do with it
 121 | once he had completed the mature system, which is this.
 122 | OK.
 123 | So that's the idea of what you've gotten yourself into.
 124 | OK.
 125 | Some course mechanics.
 126 | The syllabus is on Quercus.
 127 | I will just say a few things about it.
 128 | I find discussing course mechanics in the beginning
 129 | of the semester really boring.
 130 | So I'm going to do this very quickly.
 131 | You have to write two essays, and there is a final exam
 132 | during the exam period.
 133 | The, you know, it couldn't be more straightforward.
 134 | OK.
 135 | Your participation grade will be determined
 136 | on the basis of how many weeks you submit questions
 137 | about the reading.
 138 | So the questions about the reading should be written.
 139 | You can type them if you want, but it's also
 140 | fine to submit them just handwritten,
 141 | as long as your handwriting is legible.
 142 | And they should be questions about the reading for that week.
 143 | And not, you know, like, I was an undergraduate too once.
 144 | I know all the tricks, right?
 145 | So not like you just turn to a random page in the reading,
 146 | and you find Hegel saying, the study of philosophy
 147 | is hindered by the conduct of only clever argumentation.
 148 | Why does Hegel say the, you know,
 149 | that's not what I'm looking for.
 150 | You know, put, like, say a little bit more
 151 | about why this question is relevant or contextualize it.
 152 | Given that Hegel says this, and he says this other thing,
 153 | how is this compatible?
 154 | Why does Hegel think that this transition is unproblematic?
 155 | Why is this argument supposed to be good?
 156 | How is this consistent?
 157 | Something like that.
 158 | Two for every week.
 159 | OK.
 160 | So some of you probably, how many of you
 161 | brought reading questions for this week?
 162 | OK, good.
 163 | That's great.
 164 | A lot of you joined the class later,
 165 | didn't know about this, so I'm going
 166 | to treat those as extra credit.
 167 | You can hand them, you can give them to me
 168 | at the end of the day.
 169 | But in general, they're due first thing.
 170 | So you know, this is like, don't show up
 171 | and think you can scribble a few questions about the reading
 172 | and grab total credit for it.
 173 | That's not going to work.
 174 | OK.
 175 | Other than that, how many of you here are auditing this class?
 176 | OK.
 177 | That's a lot.
 178 | That's like an insane number.
 179 | OK.
 180 | So let me just say, those of you who
 181 | are taking this class for credit,
 182 | you have something of great value that other people want,
 183 | which means you have to earn it.
 184 | So do your best work.
 185 | Because if you don't do your best work,
 186 | I would prefer that you just drop the class
 187 | and one of the people who's auditing it take your spot.
 188 | Because many of them are very, very motivated.
 189 | OK.
 190 | Let me say one or two things more.
 191 | Why is Hegel relevant, or why is Hegel important?
 192 | Why should you spend the amount of energy
 193 | that you're going to have to expend this semester on Hegel?
 194 | I mean, the other reason that I've designed this class
 195 | is I wanted to finally teach a Hegel class that
 196 | wasn't impossibly difficult.
 197 | This is supposed to be like moderate level difficulty
 198 | Hegel.
 199 | OK.
 200 | I mean, for the most part, not a sign of a really impossible
 201 | hard things in Hegel.
 202 | But there's a few weeks where we are
 203 | going to read some really hard stuff in Hegel,
 204 | and I will kind of hold your hand through those.
 205 | OK.
 206 | So I regard Hegel as the philosophical equal,
 207 | the peer of Plato and Aristotle.
 208 | I think he's the only modern philosopher other than Kant,
 209 | who has that kind of status.
 210 | In a more generous mood, or if Tariq Dicco were here,
 211 | I would include Heidegger.
 212 | But, and Hegel has had an enormous influence
 213 | on European philosophy, the Western philosophy,
 214 | after that.
 215 | But always, I think, in a distorted form.
 216 | That is to say, the Hegel that was taken up
 217 | and was influential in philosophy after that
 218 | was always in one way or another distorted version of Hegel.
 219 | So that, in a certain way, the true Hegel
 220 | remains to be understood and really
 221 | philosophically appreciated.
 222 | Which also makes reading Hegel very exciting,
 223 | because there's more work to be done in understanding Hegel,
 224 | not just exegetically, but philosophically,
 225 | than there is with any other comparably
 226 | important modern philosophy, even Kant, especially Kant.
 227 | Kant is, in a certain way, relatively well understood,
 228 | vastly better understood than Hegel.
 229 | And Hegel has only himself to blame for this.
 230 | The books are, aside from the philosophy of right,
 231 | extraordinarily kind of maddeningly difficult.
 232 | Sometimes read as though they are.
 233 | So Hegel has a reputation, especially
 234 | in the English language tradition,
 235 | of just being an author of Gable de Gug of gibberish.
 236 | That's not true.
 237 | That reflects more on the readers who say that,
 238 | or that he's some kind of mystic.
 239 | Also, that's just a simple misreading.
 240 | But the books are forbiddingly difficult and dense.
 241 | There are significant chunks.
 242 | I mean, I've spent so much time reading these books.
 243 | I'm on my second read.
 244 | I read the Phonology of Spirit cover to cover
 245 | with some friends, and then I immediately
 246 | started rereading it from scratch.
 247 | And that's my fourth complete read through in my life.
 248 | And I'm constantly rereading the Science of Logic.
 249 | There are chunks of these books that I just
 250 | have to throw my hands around.
 251 | I don't really know what's going on.
 252 | Now, there's a reason, and we'll see this
 253 | over the course of the semester.
 254 | It's not just that Hegel was a bad writer, which he wasn't.
 255 | So Hegel has this reputation for being a bad writer.
 256 | This is simply false.
 257 | When Hegel wants to, he can be eloquent, indeed beautiful.
 258 | There's actually a philosophical reason
 259 | for why the books are written as densely as they are.
 260 | I also think part of the reason why some parts of the books
 261 | are as dense as they are is because Hegel had not fully
 262 | worked out his theory.
 263 | He had not fully worked out his system in all of the detail
 264 | that he presents it as having been worked out in.
 265 | Failures of presentation are often failures of thought.
 266 | And I think to some extent, that's
 267 | part of what's going on with Hegel in some places.
 268 | And also, I think there are philosophical reasons
 269 | for why the books have to be written in this way that
 270 | is extremely difficult to read.
 271 | But because Hegel has, in my view,
 272 | never been received as Hegel, that is to say,
 273 | the reception of Hegel has always been the distortion
 274 | of Hegel.
 275 | That makes Hegel exciting.
 276 | In a certain way, in other moods,
 277 | I would say this more vociferously.
 278 | In a certain way, the big, unaccomplished task
 279 | of philosophy in Western tradition
 280 | is fully understanding and grappling with Hegel.
 281 | I think that's the thing that hasn't really been done.
 282 | And this class can serve as a kind of introduction
 283 | to doing that, and maybe an inspiration to you
 284 | to do that further.
 285 | Because one of the ways that I hope this class will function
 286 | is as a propagutic for you to read more of Hegel
 287 | on your own, an entry point in Hegel
 288 | so that you can study it more on your own.
 289 | OK, there is no textbook for this class.
 290 | All of the readings are going to be online
 291 | on corkis in the form of PDFs, which
 292 | means that if you want to, you can read them on screens.
 293 | And that means that I will have to allow laptops
 294 | in this class if normally I don't, which I hate doing.
 295 | The reason I hate doing that is because these things are just
 296 | distraction machines.
 297 | So whenever you see a screen, what you should see
 298 | is a conspiracy by very rich and powerful people
 299 | to destroy your mind and ruin your life,
 300 | because that's, in fact, what they are.
 301 | They are the great toxin of our contemporary world.
 302 | And so I would prefer to not have them in the classroom.
 303 | Somehow, all of the best philosophy ever written
 304 | was written without them, so we don't actually
 305 | need them for any of this.
 306 | In fact, all of the best philosophy
 307 | was done and taught without artificial light.
 308 | So I would really like to someday teach a class.
 309 | If you go to old German universities,
 310 | if you go to what is now Pumboldo Investitatie
 311 | in Berlin, the University of Berlin,
 312 | where Hegel is a professor, the Bruins
 313 | have these gigantic floor-to-ceiling windows,
 314 | because of course, there was no artificial light.
 315 | And teaching by candlelight is not really a safe or
 316 | particularly practical.
 317 | So in fact, we don't even need this horrible fluorescent
 318 | or a headlighting that's ugly and destroys,
 319 | diminishes the human spirit.
 320 | But unfortunately, we are stuck with this institutional setup.
 321 | So that was all a way of saying, I encourage you
 322 | to print out the reading and read Hegel in print,
 323 | because all of the evidence is that you understand
 324 | and remember things better when you read them in print.
 325 | When you read something on paper,
 326 | you have this multimodal sensory experience of it.
 327 | It's both tactile.
 328 | If it's a pretty old book, it has an olfactory dimension.
 329 | You shouldn't taste the books.
 330 | You have a gustatory dimension.
 331 | But there's all the physical, it's carrying it around.
 332 | You develop a physical relationship with your book.
 333 | So if you've ever taken a class under critique of pure reason,
 334 | by the end of the semester, your critique is like this.
 335 | Binding has been destroyed.
 336 | It's covered in notations.
 337 | And it's like a physically important object to you.
 338 | And that physical defecation to the book, I think,
 339 | actually improves your learning and reading experience.
 340 | Even better would be if you wanted to buy or somehow
 341 | acquire the physical books.
 342 | But I'm not going to require that because, of course,
 343 | we're only going to read a little bit of this
 344 | and then a little bit of the science of logic.
 345 | If I made you buy the books for all this class,
 346 | it would be more expensive than I can reasonably expect from you.
 347 | OK.
 348 | So that is everything that I'm going
 349 | to say about course mechanics before we
 350 | dive into the phenomenology of spirit itself.
 351 | Let me just say, normally, so GWF Hegel, born in 1770,
 352 | you need 31, normally the principle
 353 | in which I operate with respect to historical philosophers
 354 | is all that we need to say about them is they were born,
 355 | they worked, and they died.
 356 | Now, I'm going to slightly violate my own rule
 357 | because I'm a big fan of the digression.
 358 | And in being a fan of the digression in the lecture,
 359 | I have no less eminent of precursor than Hegel himself
 360 | because in the transcripts of Hegel's lectures, some
 361 | of which we will read, Hegel's constantly
 362 | going on these digressions, some of which
 363 | are totally off topic and some of which are hilarious.
 364 | He'll talk about some recent play that's been displayed.
 365 | So a little bit of digression is fun,
 366 | distracts us from what Hegel calls the rigor of the concept.
 367 | But occasionally, biographical remarks about Hegel
 368 | will actually be exegetically relevant.
 369 | And so I'll say a few things about Hegel's life.
 370 | OK.
 371 | This was all that I want to say initially
 372 | about Hegel's philosophy.
 373 | I don't like beginning a class by giving
 374 | this big aerial overview of the philosopher
 375 | or the philosophical work precisely because it's
 376 | given purely externally.
 377 | It's just narration.
 378 | It's something you could learn from the Stanford
 379 | Encyclopedia of Philosophy or YouTube.
 380 | It's not philosophy.
 381 | It wouldn't be philosophically justified.
 382 | It wouldn't be doing any philosophy for you.
 383 | We wouldn't be doing any philosophy together.
 384 | I'd just be telling you some stuff.
 385 | So as we'll see, because Hegel takes very seriously
 386 | the ambition that philosophy should develop everything
 387 | from itself, it's particularly inappropriate to Hegel
 388 | to begin with this external just telling you something,
 389 | mere reports.
 390 | I would prefer to begin talking about Hegel
 391 | by doing philosophy in the Hegelian way, which
 392 | is developing it internally just through thinking something
 393 | through.
 394 | So that's all that I want to say initially
 395 | about Hegel's philosophy.
 396 | I'll just say one or two things more
 397 | about what's special about Hegel.
 398 | Hegel is probably the most ambitious philosopher
 399 | who's ever existed.
 400 | So the ambition of Hegel's philosophy
 401 | is to develop all of this, which is
 402 | to say a completely systematic epistemology,
 403 | a completely systematic metaphysics,
 404 | a completely systematic account of the natural world,
 405 | a completely systematic account of the mind, which
 406 | includes a completely systematic account
 407 | of moral and political philosophy,
 408 | a completely systematic account of art and its history,
 409 | a completely systematic account of the history of religion,
 410 | And true religion, Hegel calls consonant religion,
 411 | without any presuppositions.
 412 | That's the most ambitious that I think philosophy has ever
 413 | gotten.
 414 | So Hegel is, in a certain way, the person
 415 | who has the most faith or confidence in philosophy
 416 | that I can think of.
 417 | Everyone since Hegel has been more disillusioned
 418 | about philosophy.
 419 | Or another way of pointing that point
 420 | is Hegel is even more than Kant.
 421 | The person, the philosopher, with the most confidence
 422 | that reason, just reasoning, can do everything that we want.
 423 | That it can be completely satisfactory.
 424 | Reason can be completely self-determinate.
 425 | Doesn't need anything outside.
 426 | Everyone in philosophy, since Hegel,
 427 | has been more pessimistic about the possibility
 428 | of this complete self-determination
 429 | of rational thought.
 430 | Questions about that before we dive
 431 | into the phenomenology of spirit itself?
 432 | No?
 433 | Yeah.
 434 | Hey.
 435 | I'm not sure what that's supposed to be,
 436 | but can I ask something about the question?
 437 | Sure.
 438 | The question is this.
 439 | On the set of us, that's like two, three lines.
 440 | But you ask us to contextualize it.
 441 | That would require us to pull up Hegel.
 442 | But that makes it less space, like one line or two.
 443 | So by two or three sentence, do you
 444 | make two or three sentence of a whole world together?
 445 | You're taking, like, we'll figure it out.
 446 | Yeah, you're taking a rule of thumb too precisely.
 447 | Oh, the other thing I want to say
 448 | is if anyone reads German, I would
 449 | encourage you to try to read at least some of this in German.
 450 | The translations vary a great deal in quality.
 451 | And so one of the themes of this semester
 452 | that you will probably learn to find really annoying
 453 | will be complaining about various Hegel translations.
 454 | I haven't been hard about whether to use this
 455 | as the textbook for the course.
 456 | This is the closest thing to a collection
 457 | of all of the relevant texts that we
 458 | would read in this class.
 459 | The reason I decided against it is the translations
 460 | are, in some cases, very strange.
 461 | And the selections are, in some cases, I think not ideal.
 462 | And so then I thought, OK, then they're
 463 | going to have to listen to me complain, not only
 464 | about the translations, but also Holgate selections.
 465 | That will open order the hell out of them.
 466 | So I'll just make my own selections.
 467 | Yes?
 468 | I don't know if it's too early, but I
 469 | want to know how Hegel connects logic to aesthetics and how.
 470 | Oh, that's way too early.
 471 | Way too early.
 472 | We're not even.
 473 | We don't even know what logic is yet.
 474 | That's just a word on a blackboard.
 475 | So using the Cambridge translations.
 476 | Using the Cambridge translations insofar as it's possible.
 477 | So the Cambridge translations, the Cambridge Hegel
 478 | translations, you might think, oh, my god,
 479 | they're going to translate everything.
 480 | But they have now translated the phenomenology
 481 | of spirit, the science of logic, the encyclopedia logic,
 482 | the Hegel's writings from Heidelberg, and that's it.
 483 | And so you might think, oh, everything's coming out more.
 484 | No, Hilary Gaskin, the main philosophy
 485 | editor at Cambridge University Press,
 486 | has announced it's complete.
 487 | That's all they're going to do.
 488 | And that's all they ever intended to.
 489 | That is not, in fact, a complete story.
 490 | In fact, so I'll tell you, at some point
 491 | when I feel like we need a break,
 492 | I'll give you the complete backstory about how
 493 | the Cambridge Hegel translation is so radically incomplete.
 494 | And it was, of course, never intended to be in complete
 495 | this way.
 496 | The short answer is they decided to woefully
 497 | underpay the editorial order, who all resigned.
 498 | And then at some point, the new editorial board,
 499 | some point Cambridge just realized
 500 | it wasn't worth the money.
 501 | So we're now in this totally ridiculous situation
 502 | that there is never going to be, in the foreseeable future,
 503 | a good, complete translation of the works
 504 | of Hegel in England.
 505 | So now, OK, I'll say one other thing.
 506 | There are two different, there's basically
 507 | two different editions of the works of Hegel in German.
 508 | The first one is published by a, is now
 509 | published by a press in Germany called Zuk.
 510 | Those are, if you ever see, they're
 511 | sort of very dark blue paperbacks.
 512 | That translation goes back to a translation that was made,
 513 | sorry, an edition that was made immediately
 514 | after Hegel's death by this group called themselves
 515 | the Friends of Hegel.
 516 | Now, the problem with that edition
 517 | is that it isn't up to contemporary
 518 | filmological snuff.
 519 | In particular, with respect to Hegel's lectures,
 520 | they did this thing that from a contemporary point of view
 521 | was totally outrageous.
 522 | People, the people who were editing Hegel's lectures,
 523 | took all of Hegel's notes and the student transcripts
 524 | and then composed one sort of condensed version
 525 | of all of this information and then destroyed,
 526 | in many cases, the originals so that we can't verify
 527 | whether their edition was correct.
 528 | So this was for, this was until the 70s, the only edition
 529 | of Hegel that there was.
 530 | Now, after that, there's the Academy edition,
 531 | where people actually sat down and did
 532 | the really philologically respectable thing.
 533 | I mean, the other thing is, for instance, the Friends of Hegel
 534 | edition only contains one edition of the Encyclopedia.
 535 | It only contains one edition of the Science of Logic.
 536 | That, by contemporary philological standards,
 537 | is radically inadequate.
 538 | The Academy edition does this much more complete job.
 539 | But the weird result of that is almost all
 540 | of the translations of Hegel into English that
 541 | existed historically are based on this.
 542 | And so you would think, well, this
 543 | would be a perfect opportunity for Cambridge
 544 | to do the English translations from that.
 545 | But that's not going to happen because they
 546 | underpaid the editorial board.
 547 | Also, these editorial board guys,
 548 | like they're all tenure professors
 549 | drawing massive salaries.
 550 | They could just do it for free.
 551 | But I wouldn't tell that to their face.
 552 | So the other thing that's weird is,
 553 | so there are all these people make a big deal about this.
 554 | They just think, oh, you can never
 555 | talk about Hegel's lectures from the old Friends of Hegel
 556 | edition.
 557 | You have to only cite the Academy edition.
 558 | But the problem is, almost all of the reception of Hegel
 559 | through the history of philosophy
 560 | from his death in 1831 until whenever this was published
 561 | in the 60s or 70s was based on the old edition.
 562 | So these poorly edited editions of Hegel's lectures
 563 | are the things that are really influential.
 564 | So when people talk about Hegel's philosophy of history,
 565 | almost everyone who's ever engaged
 566 | with Hegel's philosophy of history
 567 | was engaging with the poorly edited edition,
 568 | including Marx and everyone else.
 569 | So I think you can't just ignore this one.
 570 | In many cases, the older edition, the not so good edition,
 571 | makes the text much more readable and fluent.
 572 | And so when we come to read some of Hegel's lectures,
 573 | for instance, his lectures on the philosophy of art,
 574 | the philosophy of religion, and the history of philosophy,
 575 | I will assign some of the translations
 576 | from the older editions because they're
 577 | just more readable.
 578 | And they are the things that everyone's been talking about.
 579 | Ever since, so if you hear someone talking about Hegel
 580 | and some other book, they're almost certainly
 581 | talking about this.
 582 | So what value would it be to you?
 583 | You're like, oh, well, actually, the Hotho transcript.
 584 | You don't care.
 585 | I barely care.
 586 | OK.
 587 | Other questions before we start talking
 588 | about the phenomenology of spirit?
 589 | Yes.
 590 | I've heard that three years ago,
 591 | you called it a people person.
 592 | That only went through 40 or 50 pages of the phenomenology.
 593 | Yeah.
 594 | What would be the content-wise difference
 595 | between these two persons in terms of yours?
 596 | More of you will understand what I'm saying in this course.
 597 | Or no, the problem with that course is, so I got through
 598 | about, did Siwan tell you that?
 599 | Yeah.
 600 | OK.
 601 | Siwan likes that word.
 602 | So let's see.
 603 | If I did 50 pages in that class, I got more than that.
 604 | I got all the way up to maybe sort of skepticism.
 605 | But I kind of rushed through some of skepticism.
 606 | So we did maybe like 70 pages.
 607 | And the problem with that is you just
 608 | learn in a lot of detail the early moves
 609 | of the phenomenology of spirit, which doesn't tell you.
 610 | That basically taught people 10% of this.
 611 | This is 10% of this weird, immature, semi-juvenalia
 612 | introduction to Hegel system.
 613 | It's not Hegel system.
 614 | OK.
 615 | But to say more about why just teaching
 616 | the phenomenology of spirit would be so inadequate,
 617 | I mean, certainly this version of 360
 618 | is an elaborate apology for the last time I taught 360.
 619 | Let's just dive into the text.
 620 | So if you do not have a copy of the text,
 621 | rearrange yourself so that you are sitting next to someone
 622 | who does have a copy of the text.
 623 | So I'll give you a few minutes to do that.
 624 | So if two of you are sitting next to each other
 625 | and you have copies of the text, yeah, sorry, what?
 626 | Yeah, I mean, there'll be some differences.
 627 | But you'll basically know what's going on.
 628 | Is anyone in a Hegel island isolated
 629 | from any other copy of the text?
 630 | I would have brought additional copies of the text
 631 | if I had thought of that.
 632 | Yeah, no screen.
 633 | OK.
 634 | It is a natural supposition that in philosophy,
 635 | before one gets down to dealing with what is that issue,
 636 | namely the actual cognition of what in truth is.
 637 | So the issue of philosophy is actually
 638 | cognizing what in truth is.
 639 | Now, there's two words here in German, erkenen and bissen.
 640 | Pinker has, in almost all cases, translated erkenen
 641 | has to cognize, and bissen has to know.
 642 | But he's, now there is a difference between erkenen
 643 | and bissen in Hegel.
 644 | But erkenen and bissen are both totally ordinary words
 645 | in German for knowledge.
 646 | So epistemology in German is referred to as erketnesteri,
 647 | the theory of erketens.
 648 | That's the noun for erketens.
 649 | So it would be totally fine to translate both of them
 650 | as knowledge.
 651 | But Pinker has decided to just mark in English
 652 | a distinction in the German.
 653 | So it would be totally fine if we read this as saying,
 654 | before one gets down to dealing with what is at issue,
 655 | namely the actual knowledge, actually knowing what is true.
 656 | So now, Hegel uses the difference
 657 | between bissen and erkenen to mark some kind of difference.
 658 | But it isn't super crucial right now.
 659 | So we can also just read cognition here as knowledge.
 660 | It is a natural supposition that in philosophy,
 661 | before one gets down to dealing with what is at issue,
 662 | namely the actual knowledge of what in truth is.
 663 | So the business of philosophy is actually
 664 | knowing what in truth is.
 665 | So not potentially knowing or kind of knowing or having faith,
 666 | but knowing and knowing what is true, what is actually true.
 667 | It is first necessary to come to an understanding
 668 | about knowledge, which is regarded
 669 | as the instrument by which one seizes hold of the absolute
 670 | or as the means by which one catches sight of it.
 671 | So the first word you should stumble over here
 672 | is the absolute.
 673 | So the absolute is this major topic
 674 | and preoccupation of German philosophy from Kant to Hegel.
 675 | So in the context in which Hegel is writing this,
 676 | roughly Jena in 1807, the absolute
 677 | is the thing everyone cares about.
 678 | But I want to put the absolute aside for a moment,
 679 | because this is kind of provisional.
 680 | Over the course of today, you'll understand better
 681 | what I mean by this.
 682 | Hegel won't, in the introduction to the phenomenology,
 683 | yet have an argument that the topic of philosophy
 684 | should be the absolute, or that what the topic of knowledge
 685 | is is the absolute.
 686 | He, over the course of the phenomenology and the logic,
 687 | will develop that.
 688 | So this is a foreshadowing of something
 689 | that you usually have to argue for,
 690 | although his audience in 1807 would assume, of course,
 691 | what we really wanted to have knowledge of is the absolute.
 692 | So what the absolute is, I'm going
 693 | to set aside until we see Hegel's view of the absolute.
 694 | But if you need a sort of precursor,
 695 | you can think of it as God a little bit better.
 696 | You can think of it as the unconditioned in Kant.
 697 | A little bit better, you can think of it as Spinoza's God.
 698 | Even better, you could think of it as Spinoza's God,
 699 | where Spinoza's God is understood neither
 700 | determinately as a subject or as an object.
 701 | And if that sounds very weird, that's fine.
 702 | We'll come back to it.
 703 | So the important thing about paragraph 73,
 704 | the beginning of the introduction,
 705 | is Hegel is playing off various tropes in modern philosophy.
 706 | So when you read the beginning of the introduction
 707 | of phenomenology, you should think of the beginning
 708 | of Locke's essay, concerning the understanding,
 709 | or the beginning of conscripti capuris.
 710 | The characteristic move of modern philosophy
 711 | is before we investigate the object,
 712 | we have to investigate the cognitive powers
 713 | of the subject.
 714 | So what Hegel does now is then riff on various tropes
 715 | in modern philosophy.
 716 | So he's presenting this thing that you would normally assume.
 717 | It is a natural supposition.
 718 | Although we'll see that in a certain way,
 719 | Hegel doesn't share this supposition.
 720 | He's distancing himself from this supposition.
 721 | So the natural supposition is, before we
 722 | go about the business of knowing objects,
 723 | we first have to investigate the power of the knowledge
 724 | itself.
 725 | We have to know what knowledge is.
 726 | So he then riffs on various metaphors
 727 | that you find in early modern philosophy.
 728 | For one, there might be one rather than another form
 729 | of cognition that is better suited to achieving
 730 | this final end.
 731 | So the idea is, well, you have to decide,
 732 | is it the senses that give us knowledge of what is?
 733 | Or is it the intellect?
 734 | Or is it reason if there's a difference
 735 | between the intellect and reason?
 736 | Is it faith that gives us knowledge of what is?
 737 | So those are the kinds of issues that he's gesturing.
 738 | If cognition is a faculty of a determinant kind and scope,
 739 | then without a more precise determination
 740 | of its nature and limits, one ends up grasping clouds of error
 741 | rather than the heaven of truth.
 742 | So if knowledge is a particular human ability
 743 | among other abilities, then there
 744 | are things that that ability can be exercised with respect to
 745 | and things that it cannot be exercised with respect to.
 746 | So we have to get clarity on that before we
 747 | try to go about knowing objects.
 748 | If cognition is the instrument for seizing hold
 749 | of the absolute, then we don't get the absolute
 750 | as it is in itself, but we form and change.
 751 | So the idea of, if cognition is something like a tool,
 752 | then what it gets us is not the object in itself,
 753 | but the object introverse that's shaped by the tool.
 754 | So once again, these are not things
 755 | I think Hegel needs to put a lot of argumentative weight on.
 756 | What he's doing is pointing out that these standard moves
 757 | in modern epistemology bring with them these kinds of thoughts.
 758 | And he's raising this as a way you could begin in philosophy,
 759 | but then also distancing himself by them
 760 | by pointing out that those kinds of moves in modern philosophy
 761 | bring with them very familiar concerns about whether we'll
 762 | ever be able to know reality as it is in itself.
 763 | Most importantly, in 1807, the thing that's
 764 | always in the back of Hegel's mind is Kant and the idea
 765 | that Kant's investigation to the powers of human mind
 766 | in the critique of pure reason winds up
 767 | proving that we don't know reality as it is in itself.
 768 | So he's riffing on all these various thoughts
 769 | that if you begin by investigating knowledge
 770 | itself, you'll always wind up being distanced from the object
 771 | as it is in itself.
 772 | Likewise, if we think of knowledge as a passive medium,
 773 | well, if you really think through the idea of a passive medium,
 774 | a medium kind of changes what passes through it.
 775 | And so then you can kind of remove.
 776 | So the metaphor is, well, if it's a medium changes,
 777 | the light passes into glass.
 778 | There's an angle of refraction.
 779 | So if we know this, maybe we can infer exactly where
 780 | the thing came from.
 781 | But then all we'll know is the direction
 782 | from which the ray came from.
 783 | So Hegel is just riffing on standard metaphors
 784 | about knowledge in modern philosophy
 785 | and very familiar reasons for thinking
 786 | that if you think of knowledge that way,
 787 | you will wind up with a conclusion
 788 | that you don't know reality as it is itself,
 789 | you know it only as it appears to you,
 790 | or you know it only in relation to the human mind,
 791 | et cetera, et cetera.
 792 | Yeah.
 793 | So how much we have prior knowledge of the world,
 794 | and how he gets to the absoluteness?
 795 | Is it relative to us, or is it universal?
 796 | We're way too early to get there.
 797 | We're at super, super preliminary steps here.
 798 | So now I'm going to just, because this is not the last time
 799 | I'm on 2016 where I only got 370 pages,
 800 | I'm not going to go through sentence by sentence.
 801 | I'm going to jump through to particular passages
 802 | that I think are eliminated.
 803 | So then paragraph 74 begins, and he says, well, look,
 804 | if this we could just as well, so let me just read this passage.
 805 | If the common concern about falling into error
 806 | sets up a mistrust of science, which itself,
 807 | untroubled by such scruples, simply sets itself to work
 808 | and actually cognizes it, it is still
 809 | difficult to say why on the contrary,
 810 | a mistrust of this mistrust should not be set up,
 811 | and why one should not be concerned
 812 | that this fear of erring is already the error itself.
 813 | So what he's pointing out is the things that
 814 | get us into a mistrust or skepticism
 815 | about our ability to know are themselves something
 816 | that we could be skeptical about.
 817 | In particular, we don't have to assume
 818 | that knowledge is an instrument or a tool or a passive media
 819 | or one ability among others, that those themselves,
 820 | those standard assumptions that structure modern epistemology
 821 | and that lead to the conclusion that we don't know realities
 822 | of itself are themselves something that is questionable.
 823 | Skipping a little bit, but above all, this picture
 824 | that he's been somewhat satirically riffing on
 825 | presupposes that the absolute stands on one side
 826 | and that cognition stands on the other or itself
 827 | and separated from the absolute, though cognition is
 828 | nevertheless something real.
 829 | So what he's saying is the assumption here
 830 | in all of this stuff, let's just once again, for now,
 831 | treat the absolute as the object of knowledge.
 832 | The assumption is I'm over here, the object is a distinct being,
 833 | and then somehow I have to overcome this distinctness
 834 | in order to know.
 835 | And the standard early modern thought
 836 | is, well, how could I know an object that's distinct for me?
 837 | Well, it would have to affect me, have to affect my senses.
 838 | And I would have to have some capacity
 839 | to be affected sensorily by it.
 840 | And then all of these early modern worries
 841 | from Locke, Hume, Kant, Descartes, everyone else,
 842 | arise, namely, would that allow us to know the object as it is
 843 | or only as it affects us?
 844 | Would it allow us to know the way the object really is
 845 | or only as it appears to our senses?
 846 | So he's pointing out that that very standard picture
 847 | of knowledge as a particular relation of one being
 848 | to another, or let's say, a capacity that one being has
 849 | to know another being or other beings,
 850 | is itself something we can question.
 851 | We're not stuck with that.
 852 | OK.
 853 | I'm going to skip 73.
 854 | OK.
 855 | So now he says, look, instead of fussing around with answers
 856 | to all of this, that is to say, instead of fussing around
 857 | with the whole problem space of early modern epistemology,
 858 | empiricism, rationalism, sensibility, understanding,
 859 | reason, instead of all of that, instead of fussing around
 860 | with answers to all of this, it is
 861 | possible to reject these outright
 862 | as contingent and arbitrary representations
 863 | and to regard the affiliated use of words,
 864 | such as absolute cognition, and also objective and subjective,
 865 | and countless others, whose meaning is assumed
 866 | to be generally known as even a kind of deceit.
 867 | So one thing we can do is step back and say,
 868 | the meaning of subject, object, cognition, absolutely,
 869 | they themselves are things that have to be determined.
 870 | It's not self-evident what these things mean,
 871 | and it's not self-evident that we have to begin philosophy
 872 | by assuming a particular meaning of them
 873 | or a particular set up for epistemology, namely,
 874 | that one, skipping a little bit.
 875 | They constitute only an empty appearance
 876 | of a knowing, which immediately vanishes
 877 | in the face of the science, which comes onto the scene.
 878 | OK.
 879 | So just a little note about language.
 880 | Bissen is to know.
 881 | Bissenschaft is science.
 882 | But that means just etymologically in German,
 883 | there's a very close connection between Bissen and Bissenschaft.
 884 | So for now, Hegel has a very distinctive notion
 885 | of what a Bissenschaft is.
 886 | He hasn't developed it yet.
 887 | So let's just take on board the idea
 888 | that if the aim of philosophy is to know, to have Bissen,
 889 | the aim of philosophy is to be a Bissenschaft,
 890 | that is to say, to be a science, a body of knowing.
 891 | Now, this is unnatural in English
 892 | because we have two different words.
 893 | And because we have this, frankly,
 894 | stupid tendency in English to assume that the word science
 895 | only applies to the natural sciences.
 896 | That just doesn't make sense in German.
 897 | In German, the study of literature
 898 | is the Tsozwe Bissenschaft, the study of politics
 899 | is Politische Bissenschaft.
 900 | Any systematically ordered body of knowledge is Bissenschaft.
 901 | So the introduction of science at this point
 902 | is not as arbitrary as it seems, although over the course
 903 | of the system, we'll get a much, much richer notion of science.
 904 | So all that Hegel is doing is saying, look,
 905 | it's standard to begin by assuming
 906 | that we want in philosophy is knowledge,
 907 | that is to say, scientific knowing, science,
 908 | of what actually is.
 909 | And the standard way we begin is by assuming this.
 910 | But this leads very quickly by arguments
 911 | that are familiar from early modern philosophy
 912 | to the conclusion that we don't know objects
 913 | as they are in themselves.
 914 | We only know their appearances or other structural features.
 915 | Or even more radically, in Hume, in some way,
 916 | we don't really know anything other than our own impressions
 917 | of objects.
 918 | But we don't have to assume that because it's not obvious
 919 | what any of these terms mean.
 920 | OK.
 921 | But then he says, all of this vanishes
 922 | when science comes on the scene.
 923 | So when someone who has scientific knowing,
 924 | who knows what, in actuality, is the case,
 925 | and does so scientifically, when they show up,
 926 | all of the rest of this is revealed to be deceit.
 927 | But science, insofar as it comes on the scene,
 928 | is itself an appearance.
 929 | Science is coming onto the scene is not yet science
 930 | as it is carried out and unfolded in its truth.
 931 | So if I don't have knowledge, I just
 932 | have various beliefs involving these concepts.
 933 | I'm just a standard early modern epistemology person.
 934 | And someone comes on the scene who does have knowing,
 935 | that's just one more claim to knowledge among others.
 936 | We don't yet know who has knowledge.
 937 | Merely, the first appearance of knowing,
 938 | the first person who knows, doesn't necessarily
 939 | know that they know.
 940 | So Hegel goes on to say, for with regard
 941 | to a knowing that is not truthful,
 942 | science cannot simply reject it as just a common view of things
 943 | while giving out the assurance that it is itself
 944 | a completely different kind of cognition
 945 | and that the other knowing counts as absolutely nothing
 946 | for science.
 947 | Skip the rest of the sentence, through such an assurance,
 948 | science declares its being to be its power.
 949 | But untrue knowing, just as much appeals to the fact
 950 | that it is, and it gives out the assurance that science counts
 951 | as nothing to it, but one bear assurance
 952 | is just as valid as another.
 953 | So bear assurance is the old translation.
 954 | It just sounds better.
 955 | It's perfectly fine.
 956 | So what does that mean?
 957 | What it means is, if you don't know but have mere opinion,
 958 | and I come on the scene and I know,
 959 | my assertion that I know is worth just as much
 960 | as your assertion that you know, even if I know.
 961 | So the issue here is how we know what knowledge is,
 962 | or how we justify our epistemic standard.
 963 | So the issue is not knowledge of objects.
 964 | It's knowledge of what knowledge is.
 965 | So the idea is, it's not enough simply to know,
 966 | because your claim to know is just a mere assertion,
 967 | a bear assurance, just as valid and just as invalid
 968 | as the person who doesn't actually know their claim to know.
 969 | So we need to find somewhere to adjudicate
 970 | between the mere claim to knowledge, mere opinion,
 971 | and knowledge.
 972 | So knowing is agreement?
 973 | Argument?
 974 | Agreement.
 975 | Agreement, no.
 976 | OK.
 977 | Skipping a bit, 77.
 978 | Because this exposition has for its object only
 979 | knowing as it appears.
 980 | So what we're going to do is we're
 981 | going to look at appearances of knowledge.
 982 | That is to say, claims to know.
 983 | But once again, we're not interested in particular.
 984 | I claim to know that Bismarck is the capital of South Dakota.
 985 | I claim to know that Fargo is not the capital of South Dakota.
 986 | Maybe someone, some poor, benated, Canadian,
 987 | ignorant of the geography of the Upper Midwest, my homeland,
 988 | might claim to know falsely that Fargo is the capital of South
 989 | Dakota.
 990 | It is not.
 991 | We're not interested in that.
 992 | We're interested in the sort of one level more general
 993 | about what you think knowledge is.
 994 | So the exposition has for its object only knowing as it appears.
 995 | That is to say, appearances of conceptions of knowledge.
 996 | So you have a conception of what knowledge is.
 997 | I have a conception of what knowledge is.
 998 | Even if my conception is right, let's just assume yours is right.
 999 | My claim about what knowledge is is just as valid as yours.
1000 | One is just to bear assurance just as much as the other.
1001 | It does not itself seem to be the science, which
1002 | is free and self-moving within its own proper shape.
1003 | So this exposition does not itself seem to be the science.
1004 | So when Hegel says something doesn't appear or merely appears,
1005 | that's really important.
1006 | So he's saying you would think at the beginning
1007 | this exposition is not going to be science
1008 | because we don't know what science is yet.
1009 | We don't know what knowledge is.
1010 | It will actually turn out to be more complicated than that later on.
1011 | But let's just take the appearance at face value for now.
1012 | So this exposition where there's an appearance of knowing
1013 | is just someone's claim to knowing backed up
1014 | by some conception of knowledge.
1015 | That doesn't look to be knowing yet because they
1016 | don't know that they know.
1017 | But from this standpoint can instead
1018 | be taken to be the path of natural consciousness,
1019 | pressing forward towards true knowing.
1020 | It can be taken to be the path of the soul wandering
1021 | through this series of ways it takes shape,
1022 | as if these were stations put forward in advance to it
1023 | by its own nature so that it purifies itself into spirit
1024 | by arriving at a cognition of what it is in itself
1025 | through the complete experience of its own self.
1026 | So that description, 77 is a description of this book.
1027 | It's an exposition, which appears not to be science
1028 | itself yet, and let's stick with the appearance.
1029 | Let's assume that this is from the first page not yet science,
1030 | but merely the appearance of science.
1031 | But what it really is is it's the path of natural consciousness.
1032 | So what is natural consciousness?
1033 | It's something like the conception of knowledge
1034 | we begin with pre-philosophically.
1035 | Very roughly, it's this.
1036 | It's the idea that there's a distinction
1037 | between consciousness, the subject,
1038 | and its other, the object, and that consciousness
1039 | has to somehow overcome that, maybe
1040 | by the object affecting its senses, et cetera, et cetera.
1041 | This is natural consciousness.
1042 | So the exposition, this book is going
1043 | to be an exposition of the path of natural consciousness
1044 | pressing forwards towards true known, towards science.
1045 | Or it can be taken to be the path of the soul wandering
1046 | through the series of ways it takes shape.
1047 | So the phenomenology of this will
1048 | be an exposition of different shapes or forms
1049 | of consciousness, which means different conceptions
1050 | of what knowledge is, different conceptions
1051 | of the relationship between consciousness and its object.
1052 | As if these were stations put forward in advance to it
1053 | by its own nature.
1054 | So these stations, these different forms of consciousness,
1055 | are not given to it from outside,
1056 | but they develop out of it itself,
1057 | so that it purifies itself into spirit
1058 | by arriving at a cognition of what it is in itself
1059 | through the complete experience of its own self.
1060 | So this is going to be the exposition
1061 | of how natural consciousness becomes spirit,
1062 | and therefore truly knows itself and has scientific knowledge.
1063 | Now, what is this exposition?
1064 | What is the character of the exposition of the phenomenology?
1065 | So one very standard way of reading the phenomenology
1066 | that I think is totally wrong is to think of it
1067 | as an historical description of various shapes of human
1068 | consciousness over time.
1069 | So on this reading, some of the beginning of the book
1070 | is like Stone Age consciousness, and by the end
1071 | we have like early 19th century German consciousness.
1072 | This has various problems, one of which
1073 | is it gets the chronology as out of order.
1074 | So somehow like Newtonian science comes before the Greeks.
1075 | There are other problems with it, namely,
1076 | it makes the whole book completely incoherent.
1077 | It turns it into the world's most incoherently written
1078 | piece of intellectual history.
1079 | It's like Will Durant, as written by Hegel.
1080 | And it also completely undermines
1081 | the philosophical account, because what happened does not
1082 | in and of itself have any necessity.
1083 | So I don't think that it's historical.
1084 | I think that this exposition is a purely
1085 | philosophical or logical.
1086 | So what we do is we start with natural consciousness, which
1087 | is a conception of what knowing is.
1088 | It's roughly this.
1089 | As we'll see, it's going to start even more minimally
1090 | than this.
1091 | We're going to start with this, and then we're
1092 | going to develop out of this other shapes of consciousness,
1093 | other conceptions of what knowledge is,
1094 | till we get to what Hegel identifies as science, what
1095 | he identifies as the knowing of the absolute,
1096 | and what he here identifies as consciousness becoming spirit.
1097 | Now, all of those things are going to be the same.
1098 | They're all going to be identical.
1099 | But let me just say something about the latter.
1100 | What does it mean that consciousness becomes spirit?
1101 | As Hegel says at the end of 77, it's
1102 | not that consciousness wasn't spirit and then becomes spirit.
1103 | It's that consciousness becomes aware of itself as spirit.
1104 | So one way of thinking about the phenomenology, the one
1105 | that I'm going to emphasize, is its consciousness developing
1106 | out of itself a series of shapes of consciousness,
1107 | conceptions of knowing, until it gets to one
1108 | that is knowing, full stop.
1109 | True scientific knowing of what in actuality is.
1110 | That will turn out also to be knowledge of the absolute.
1111 | For the preview of incredibly weird Hegel stuff to come,
1112 | it will turn out that that is the absolute.
1113 | The absolute is the absolute knowing itself.
1114 | And you can be part of it too.
1115 | But the thing I just want to mention now
1116 | is it will also be consciousness coming
1117 | to know what it itself is, namely, spirit.
1118 | Now we're going to talk a lot more about spirit in this class
1119 | because it's one of the three parts of the system.
1120 | And we'll spend roughly half this whole semester on spirit.
1121 | What exactly spirit is in Hegel is if you gave me a pop quiz
1122 | and gave me a blue book and said you have three hours to say
1123 | what spirit is for Hegel, I think
1124 | I would throw myself out of a window.
1125 | I don't really know how I would do that.
1126 | But let me just say very briefly something about the word.
1127 | The word in German is geist.
1128 | OK.
1129 | Now, sometimes that gets translated in English
1130 | as spirit, sometimes it gets translated as mind.
1131 | So in particular, the translation
1132 | of the philosophy of spirit that we're
1133 | going to read, the only one ever published in English
1134 | because Cambridge underpaid the editorial board,
1135 | translated as the philosophy of mind.
1136 | Now, what is the relationship between spirit and mind?
1137 | They're the same word in German.
1138 | If you want to say that someone lost his mind in German,
1139 | you say, he hasein geistfel.
1140 | So we have two words where the Germans have won.
1141 | Now, Hegel is exploiting a feature of German, which
1142 | is that the word that you would use for my individual mind,
1143 | is also the word that you would use
1144 | for collective mental phenomena, like the spirit of the age.
1145 | If you say in English, the mind of the 19th century,
1146 | people will be like, what?
1147 | What's that like?
1148 | That sounds like the board.
1149 | Everyone in the 19th century was hooked up
1150 | into some big telepathic worldwide web.
1151 | Now, if you say zeitgeist, the spirit of the age in German,
1152 | that sounds totally normal.
1153 | So what Hegel is playing on the fact
1154 | that there's one word for individual mental phenomena
1155 | and collective mental phenomena.
1156 | Because what he wants us to see is
1157 | that those aren't really separate things.
1158 | Not that there's only one mind and we're all parts of it,
1159 | or that the collective mind is just the combination
1160 | of the little minds, as Margaret Thatcher famously said,
1161 | there's no such thing as society.
1162 | But neither of those views.
1163 | As always in Hegel, a third weirder thing.
1164 | But just very briefly, what matters
1165 | in the phenomenology of spirit is
1166 | that over the course of the phenomenology,
1167 | consciousness comes to realize that it's spirit.
1168 | Consciousness comes to realize that it's a mind.
1169 | No, no, no.
1170 | He means spirit in a more technical sense.
1171 | Consciousness will come to realize
1172 | that there is no difference between it and its author.
1173 | Spirit is mind in so far as it understands
1174 | that it has no other.
1175 | Now that is not going to mean that everything is spirit.
1176 | So Hegel's view is not like this is spirit.
1177 | Hegel's fully aware that there is no spirit on the moon.
1178 | The view that the phenomenology is building up towards
1179 | is that the other of spirit, nature, things that have reality
1180 | but aren't minds, are not fundamentally
1181 | different from spirit.
1182 | So that although spirit has another,
1183 | its other isn't fundamentally other to it.
1184 | Or it's the same structurally as spirit.
1185 | Now this is all provisional.
1186 | All of this is going to be worked out
1187 | in the rest of the system.
1188 | But the basic idea is that spirit is consciousness
1189 | raised to the point where it understands
1190 | that the basic structure in which consciousness thinks
1191 | is the same structure as what it thinks about.
1192 | So although there's a difference between myself and the object,
1193 | it's not an ultimate difference.
1194 | The way I think about things is fundamentally the way they are.
1195 | And what's important for Hegel is
1196 | that we're going to prove that.
1197 | We're not going to presuppose it.
1198 | Hegel's way of thinking about this, preconti and rationalism
1199 | just presupposes that the categories of thought,
1200 | basically subject, predicate, and logic,
1201 | are the metaphysical structure of being.
1202 | Or they assume something even worse,
1203 | which is that God just decided, because he's
1204 | nice, to set things up that way.
1205 | Because what God really cares about
1206 | is that we do metaphysics properly.
1207 | The murder of innocence and the complete slaughter field
1208 | that is history was relatively different to him.
1209 | He was figuring out how to create the world.
1210 | But he was like, wait, if I do it this way,
1211 | there's going to be all these genocides and all this slavery
1212 | and all this horrible shit.
1213 | But they'll be able to do metaphysics.
1214 | Yes, I'll do that.
1215 | So Hegel thinks that's even worse.
1216 | So what we need to do over the course of the system
1217 | is show that consciousness has to be spirit.
1218 | That is to say, there can't be a fundamental difference
1219 | between the categories in which thought thinks and the beings
1220 | that it thinks about.
1221 | And so that's going to mean that there's
1222 | a structural identity between spirit and nature.
1223 | Yes?
1224 | The individual mental phenomena,
1225 | collective mental phenomena, are key names
1226 | or is it too much experience?
1227 | You're getting ahead of us.
1228 | We're not there yet.
1229 | Yeah, Isaac, right.
1230 | Yeah.
1231 | So is there any comparable traits
1232 | between the non-monetary atmosphere
1233 | and the non-monology of this technology in 20th century?
1234 | Is there any connection at all?
1235 | I will answer that question when we
1236 | get to a particular passage.
1237 | Notice the word phenomenology has not been used yet.
1238 | Maybe a bit naive, but why start with natural consciousness?
1239 | We will get there.
1240 | Yeah?
1241 | What is the concept of what is the notion?
1242 | Oh, it's the bad old English translation of the concept.
1243 | To the next question, what is the concept?
1244 | That's, we will, it's going to take us a couple weeks.
1245 | But it doesn't use it here.
1246 | He uses it here, but he uses it in a non-technical sense
1247 | here to mean something like one's conception.
1248 | OK.
1249 | Yeah.
1250 | I know you said consciousness realizes that it's spirit.
1251 | Maybe it's a silly question, but what's the difference
1252 | before we know, before I as a consciousness realize
1253 | that I am spirit?
1254 | What is the difference between spirit and consciousness?
1255 | It's the difference between being something
1256 | and being aware of yourself as being that.
1257 | So your spirit all along.
1258 | Where consciousness is always spirit,
1259 | but it doesn't grasp itself as spirit.
1260 | Or I mean, once again, it's important not
1261 | to think of this temporally.
1262 | This is not about a guy named consciousness
1263 | who realizes at the end that he's spirit.
1264 | It's about consciousness.
1265 | And consciousness is spirit, but at the level
1266 | at which we describe consciousness at the beginning,
1267 | that is not a description of consciousness as spirit.
1268 | What we're going to do is unfold from that description
1269 | of consciousness, just from what consciousness is so
1270 | described that it must be spirit.
1271 | OK.
1272 | Moving on.
1273 | Natural consciousness will prove
1274 | to be only the concept of knowing,
1275 | or it will prove to be not real knowing.
1276 | OK, good.
1277 | So this is a non-technical use of concept.
1278 | This is something like what we mean
1279 | by concept in the ordinary sense.
1280 | It's a conception of knowing.
1281 | So natural consciousness thinks of itself as knowing,
1282 | and it has a conception of knowing, namely this one.
1283 | But it will prove to be not real knowing.
1284 | He also said already for that.
1285 | While it immediately regards itself rather as real knowing,
1286 | this path has negative meaning for it.
1287 | And what is the realization of the concept
1288 | will count instead to it as the loss of itself,
1289 | for on this path, it loses its truth.
1290 | In this exposition, consciousness
1291 | is going to realize that what it thinks knowing is is not
1292 | knowing.
1293 | So the truth that it thinks it knows, it doesn't know.
1294 | This path could accordingly be regarded
1295 | as the path of doubt, or more properly,
1296 | as the path of despair.
1297 | On this path, what happens is not
1298 | what is customarily understood as doubt,
1299 | a shaking of this or that supposed truth,
1300 | followed by the disappearance again of the doubt,
1301 | and then a return to the former, so that in the end,
1302 | the thing at issue is taken as it was before.
1303 | Rather, this path is the conscious insight
1304 | into the untruth of knowing as it appears.
1305 | A knowing for which that which is the most real
1306 | is rather in truth only the unrealized concept.
1307 | So what that means is consciousness
1308 | is going to realize, not that it's wrong about it
1309 | thought it knew something, but it didn't know that thing.
1310 | It thought it knew that Fargo is the capital of North Dakota,
1311 | but it isn't.
1312 | Or it's nor is it going to doubt, it's
1313 | going to say, well, there's a bunch of stuff I don't know.
1314 | I don't know anything about how things are in themselves.
1315 | I didn't know the external world.
1316 | What it's going to doubt is its conception of knowledge.
1317 | And that is the loss of itself, because a conception
1318 | of knowledge is a conception by consciousness
1319 | of what consciousness is.
1320 | So in losing that, it loses itself.
1321 | So there's this kind of existential dimension.
1322 | These are losses of self-conceptions.
1323 | So the phenomenology is also an exposition
1324 | of a sequence of self-conceptions
1325 | that consciousness might have of itself.
1326 | I'm going to skip a bunch.
1327 | So we know where we start, natural consciousness.
1328 | Although we don't really know what natural consciousness is,
1329 | this is my preliminary sketch of it.
1330 | He hasn't really told us what natural consciousness is.
1331 | We know roughly where things are going to end.
1332 | They're going to end with scientific knowledge,
1333 | where whatever doubt is generated
1334 | about these models of knowledge,
1335 | that will not be able to be generated anymore.
1336 | We don't really know why.
1337 | The completeness of the forms of non-real consciousness
1338 | will emerge through the very necessity
1339 | of their progression and their interrelations.
1340 | The progression of one form of consciousness,
1341 | one conception of knowledge to another,
1342 | is going to be necessary, not contingent.
1343 | To make this comprehensible, it can
1344 | be noted in general at the outset
1345 | that the exposition of non-truthful consciousness
1346 | in its untruth is not merely a negative movement.
1347 | So Hegel now needs to explain why we transition
1348 | from one shape of consciousness to the next.
1349 | Now, rereading the introduction today,
1350 | I think this is, I came to the conclusion
1351 | this text is not actually in the best order
1352 | that it could be in, because only a little bit later
1353 | will he explain exactly how consciousness
1354 | undermines a shape of consciousness.
1355 | But let's set that aside.
1356 | Let's assume there's some notion of consciousness
1357 | realizing that its conception of knowledge is wrong.
1358 | Now we need to understand how it moves to the next one.
1359 | Now, I just want to emphasize one thing,
1360 | that this is a process, or this development,
1361 | is not about particular knowledge claims.
1362 | We're not interested in particular knowledge
1363 | claims about particular objects.
1364 | It's at the level of a whole epistemology,
1365 | a whole conception of what knowledge is.
1366 | That's what's getting under it.
1367 | That's why doubt about that is the loss
1368 | of consciousness itself.
1369 | If you find out that you thought you knew
1370 | that South Dakota was the capital of,
1371 | sorry, that Fargo was the capital of South Dakota,
1372 | and then you find out you're wrong,
1373 | you don't lose yourself in that,
1374 | unless you have way more invested
1375 | in the geography of the Upper Midwest than you should.
1376 | Assuming that we're counting as the Dakotas
1377 | as part of the Midwest, which, okay,
1378 | we can debate about that.
1379 | You guys are probably not as invested
1380 | in inter-Midwest rivalry as I am.
1381 | But that's how we learn from each other.
1382 | Okay, so it's not merely a negative movement.
1383 | So when consciousness realizes
1384 | that its conception of knowledge is false,
1385 | that isn't, it doesn't merely reject it.
1386 | It's not just like not that.
1387 | However, only when taken as the nothing
1388 | of that from which it is, from which it emerges,
1389 | is the nothing, in fact, the true result.
1390 | Thus, it is itself a determinate nothing,
1391 | and it has a content.
1392 | So when consciousness undermines
1393 | some shape of consciousness, some conception of knowledge,
1394 | the result is not just pure,
1395 | just the abandonment of knowing.
1396 | Not just pure nothing.
1397 | It's a specific or determinate negative nothing.
1398 | It's the rejection of that previous shape,
1399 | which is itself its own shape.
1400 | So what Hegel needs to do is give us a principled reason
1401 | or a function for why one shape of consciousness
1402 | undermines itself and gives rise to the next.
1403 | So there has to be, so to speak, a law of the series.
1404 | So we have an account of where we start,
1405 | we have a kind of preliminary account
1406 | of where we're gonna end,
1407 | but we also have an account of why we move
1408 | to the next one that we do move to.
1409 | By contrast, while the result is graphed,
1410 | as it is in its truth, as determinate negation,
1411 | a new form has thereby immediately arisen.
1412 | And in the negation, the transition is made
1413 | whereby the progression through the complete series
1414 | of shapes comes about on its own accord.
1415 | So to say that a shape of consciousness
1416 | is a determinate negation is to say that it isn't something,
1417 | but it's not nothing in general.
1418 | It's not just nothing.
1419 | There's a specific thing it isn't,
1420 | namely the previous shape of consciousness.
1421 | In particular, it's a shape of consciousness
1422 | that arises in a principled way out of the failure
1423 | of the previous shape of consciousness.
1424 | And Hegel is now going to give us an account
1425 | of exactly what that function is
1426 | that gets you from one shape of consciousness
1427 | that fails to the next.
1428 | But again, rather than doing that,
1429 | he then skips to the next topic, which is where it ends.
1430 | So what we need is an account of where we start,
1431 | how we move, and where we end.
1432 | We've seen a little about where we start,
1433 | a little about how we move,
1434 | and now Hegel's gonna tell us more about how we end.
1435 | However, to knowing the goal is necessarily fixed
1436 | as the series of the progression
1437 | is as necessarily fixed as the series of the progression,
1438 | although you haven't really told us exactly
1439 | what the series of the progression is, Hegel.
1440 | The goal is the point.
1441 | The goal is the point at which knowing
1442 | no longer needs to go beyond its own self.
1443 | Where knowing itself finds itself,
1444 | and where the concept corresponds to the object,
1445 | and the object to the concept.
1446 | The progression towards this goal
1447 | is thus also unrelenting,
1448 | and at no earlier stage dissatisfaction to be felt.
1449 | So this process will end
1450 | when there's so little distinction
1451 | between subject and object,
1452 | between knowing and the object of knowing,
1453 | that no skepticism about that shape of consciousness
1454 | is possible.
1455 | So it's going to end only with such a complete coincidence
1456 | of knowing at its object
1457 | that the skeptical problem
1458 | about these conceptions of knowledge cannot arise.
1459 | Now what exactly that is,
1460 | is only described at the end of the book.
1461 | It's very, very hard to understand.
1462 | But that's where we're supposed to go.
1463 | Okay, now why can consciousness not stop
1464 | anywhere short of the entity?
1465 | Consciousness therefore suffers this violence
1466 | at its own hands,
1467 | and brings to ruin its own restricted satisfaction.
1468 | So the failure of these forms of consciousness,
1469 | these shapes of consciousness,
1470 | these conceptions of knowledge,
1471 | is not something external.
1472 | Consciousness itself realizes
1473 | that its conception of knowledge is wrong.
1474 | It does it to itself.
1475 | With the feeling of this violence,
1476 | anxiety over the truth might well withdraw
1477 | and strive to hold onto what it is in danger of losing.
1478 | But this anxiety can find no rest.
1479 | Even if it wants to remain in thoughtless indolence,
1480 | thought spoils the thoughtlessness,
1481 | and its unrest disturbs the indolence.
1482 | So as Hegel says on the next page,
1483 | where can I never find this?
1484 | I know I have this underlined.
1485 | Okay, as he says in the next couple of pages,
1486 | which we will come to,
1487 | it is an issue for consciousness
1488 | whether or not its knowing of the object
1489 | corresponds to the object, that's 56.
1490 | So consciousness, it cannot be indifferent
1491 | to consciousness whether it knows.
1492 | So consciousness purports to no objects.
1493 | It has a conception of what knowledge is.
1494 | And Hegel says it is not indifferent to consciousness.
1495 | Consciousness can't just not care
1496 | about whether what it thinks knowing is, is knowing.
1497 | Now, you might think, well,
1498 | knowledge is just one thing in life.
1499 | Like I have a lot of family members
1500 | who don't care that much about what knowledge is.
1501 | They do, only philosophers are so,
1502 | only a philosopher could say consciousness
1503 | with feeling of this violence,
1504 | anxiety over the truth might well withdraw
1505 | and strive to hold on to what is in danger of losing.
1506 | This anxiety can find no rest.
1507 | Even if it wants to remain in thoughtless indolence,
1508 | thought spoils the thoughtlessness
1509 | that its unrest disturbs the indolence.
1510 | A lot of people, their anxiety does find a rest.
1511 | They don't, they wanna remain in thoughtless indolence
1512 | and thought doesn't spoil their thoughtlessness
1513 | and unrest does not disturb their indolence.
1514 | They're very happy to not think or not know.
1515 | So this is not supposed to be a psychological claim
1516 | about particular conscious subjects.
1517 | So whatever Hegel's claim is here,
1518 | is not supposed to be contrary to
1519 | and therefore not refutable to psychological claims
1520 | about particular human beings.
1521 | As we'll see over the course of the phenomenology
1522 | or if we were to read the whole phenomenology
1523 | as we would see, knowledge,
1524 | Hegel thinks of as a very, very general phenomenon.
1525 | It's sort of ubiquitous or structural
1526 | in human life.
1527 | So doing something, action is also a kind of knowledge.
1528 | It's a representation of the object
1529 | as being in conformity with your representation of it,
1530 | as being choice worthy.
1531 | So there's no way of being indifferent to knowledge.
1532 | Any acting, any willing, any belief about the world
1533 | is making a claim to knowledge.
1534 | So notice I haven't said that knowledge here
1535 | is this thing that analytic philosophers
1536 | are kind of pointlessly obsessed with.
1537 | S knows that P.
1538 | This is a much more general structure.
1539 | This is the structure of your relationship with the world.
1540 | This you might not care about.
1541 | You probably shouldn't care about it.
1542 | Stop caring about it.
1543 | This you walk around life
1544 | carrying with you a conception of this.
1545 | It cannot be indifferent to you
1546 | whether the world does actually relate to you
1547 | the way you conceive it as related to you.
1548 | Okay, a little bit further and then we'll take a break.
1549 | Just as these preliminary and general remarks
1550 | about the manner and the necessity of the progression
1551 | have been made, so too it might be useful to recall something
1552 | about the method of the way it is carried out.
1553 | So Hegel is now gonna tell us more about
1554 | how consciousness undermines
1555 | its own conception of knowledge or the law of the series.
1556 | Sorry, not the law of the series.
1557 | The law of the series is how we go from
1558 | shape of consciousness and the shape of consciousness
1559 | and plus one, but why we have to move on.
1560 | Why one shape of consciousness fails.
1561 | Just as these preliminary and general remarks
1562 | about the manner and the necessity
1563 | of the progression have been made,
1564 | so too it might be useful to recall something
1565 | about the method of the way it is carried out.
1566 | This exposition represented as the conduct of science
1567 | in relation to knowing as it appears
1568 | and represented as the investigation and testing
1569 | of the reality of cognition seems incapable
1570 | of taking place without some kind of presupposition
1571 | with underlies it as a stem.
1572 | So it looks like, once again, it appears.
1573 | That means he's suggesting this is something you might think
1574 | he's ultimately gonna undermine it.
1575 | You might think that what we need to do
1576 | is have a standard of what knowing is
1577 | and then investigate each shape of consciousness
1578 | and say, that doesn't meet the standard.
1579 | That's not what knowing is.
1580 | For the testing consists in the application
1581 | of an accepted standard and in the resulting equality
1582 | or inequality between the standard and what is tested
1583 | lays the decision as to what is tested
1584 | is correct or incorrect.
1585 | The standard, likewise, science itself,
1586 | if science were to be the standard,
1587 | is thereby accepted as the essence or as the in itself.
1588 | Ignore, we'll come back to essence and in itself.
1589 | But here, at the point where science
1590 | first comes on the scene,
1591 | where someone makes a claim to scientific knowledge,
1592 | neither science itself nor anything else
1593 | has justified itself as the essence or as the in itself.
1594 | And without something like that taking place,
1595 | it seems that no examination could take place at all.
1596 | So there's this problem.
1597 | It looks like we need to apply a standard.
1598 | Where does the standard come from?
1599 | One can have a more determinant grasp of this contradiction
1600 | and the removal of the contradiction.
1601 | If, first of all, one is reminded
1602 | of the abstract determinations of knowing and truth
1603 | as they come before consciousness.
1604 | Okay, so what Hegel is doing in 81
1605 | is he's making a reference
1606 | to something called the dilemma of the criterion.
1607 | I'm going to erase Hegel's system.
1608 | It's actually very Hegelian.
1609 | When we get into Hegel's logic,
1610 | there's going to be a lot of erasure.
1611 | That's going to be like a main metaphor.
1612 | Hegel's a great philosopher to teach on the blackboard.
1613 | Okay.
1614 | The dilemma of the criterion
1615 | comes from a work of ancient philosophy
1616 | by Sextus empiricus.
1617 | Called outlines of purism.
1618 | Here's the basic idea.
1619 | Or this is how Hegel is thinking of the idea in Sextus.
1620 | That's what matters for our purposes.
1621 | Someone makes a claim to knowledge.
1622 | We have to have a standard
1623 | for whether that counts as knowledge or not.
1624 | Whether that's a valid knowledge group.
1625 | Whether that person in fact knows what they claim to know.
1626 | Now either that standard
1627 | is that person's own conception of knowledge.
1628 | In which case it's circular.
1629 | Very easy.
1630 | Now, totally useless.
1631 | Everyone's conception of knowledge agrees with itself,
1632 | so everyone meets their own standard.
1633 | Or the standard has to be external
1634 | to their conception of knowledge.
1635 | But then it's question-making.
1636 | So, what Hegel is doing
1637 | is raising this as a problem for his own project.
1638 | What we don't want to do
1639 | is apply external standards or criterions.
1640 | Criteria.
1641 | We'll also call it the dilemma of the standard.
1642 | Maschab.
1643 | So, what he's going to do is develop a way
1644 | of how consciousness can undermine
1645 | its own conception of knowledge
1646 | that doesn't run into the dilemma of the criteria.
1647 | One can have a more determinate grasp of this contradiction
1648 | and the removal of the contradiction
1649 | if first of all, one is reminded
1650 | of the abstract determinations of knowing their truth
1651 | as they come before consciousness.
1652 | Okay, abstract determinations means
1653 | these are sort of,
1654 | Hegel's now going to give us a very abstract model
1655 | of what consciousness acknowledges.
1656 | Now, if we were reading the whole phenomenology,
1657 | one question would be whether this model
1658 | in the introduction actually applies to the whole book.
1659 | I don't think it does,
1660 | but I think it's fine for our purposes
1661 | because it applies to the parts of the book
1662 | that we're going to read.
1663 | So, consciousness distinguishes something from itself
1664 | while at the same time it relates itself to it.
1665 | Okay, so I'm going to remove the term subject and object
1666 | because those are not yet Hegel's terms.
1667 | So we have consciousness.
1668 | It has a relation to something distinct from itself
1669 | and it also distinguishes itself from it.
1670 | Or, as it is expressed,
1671 | the something is something for consciousness.
1672 | This is for consciousness.
1673 | Something consciousness is of.
1674 | This something is something for consciousness
1675 | and the determinate aspect of this relating
1676 | or of the being of something for a consciousness is known.
1677 | So knowing is a relation of consciousness to the object.
1678 | In this direction, this object is for consciousness.
1679 | In this direction, consciousness knows this object.
1680 | However, we distinguish the being for another
1681 | from being in itself.
1682 | That which is related to knowing
1683 | is just as much distinguished from knowing
1684 | and is positive as being also external to this relation.
1685 | The aspect of this in itself is called truth.
1686 | So the aspect of being in itself
1687 | that it can be if outstanding in this relationship is truth.
1688 | Now what does that mean?
1689 | What it means is this is a super abstract structural
1690 | description of consciousness and knowledge.
1691 | Consciousness distinguishes itself from something,
1692 | the object of consciousness,
1693 | but also relates itself to knowing.
1694 | And remember, knowing here
1695 | is not necessarily propositional knowledge.
1696 | Don't worry about that.
1697 | It could be acquaintance, perceiving something.
1698 | That's a kind of note, willing something.
1699 | But what it knows has some kind of independence
1700 | of its relationship to it.
1701 | That is to say that being,
1702 | what it knows is not identical to its knowledge.
1703 | Now that doesn't mean
1704 | that this thing is completely independent of this.
1705 | It means that it isn't simply identical to this.
1706 | It means that if we got rid of this entirely,
1707 | we would have a completely different model.
1708 | Okay, that's all Hegel is assuming.
1709 | Now, Rota's truth here does not mean P.
1710 | analytic philosophy is very into P's and Q's and R's.
1711 | It is, as I like to call it, philosophy in the key of P.
1712 | Hegel is not a philosopher in the key of P.
1713 | As we'll see over the course of this semester,
1714 | I think it's actually super crucial to understanding Hegel
1715 | that Hegel cannot be put in the form of P.
1716 | There is no P, there's no value of P,
1717 | especially Hegel's view is P.
1718 | Yes.
1719 | Knowing determines consciousness
1720 | or consciousness determines knowing.
1721 | Consciousness, for now we're assuming
1722 | that knowing is the relationship
1723 | of consciousness to the object.
1724 | Knowing is a relation that consciousness has to the object.
1725 | We only call something consciousness right now
1726 | insofar as it stands in a knowing relation
1727 | to the object, to the in itself.
1728 | Okay, skip a paragraph, but the nature of the object
1729 | which we are investigating goes beyond this division
1730 | or to this semblance of division and presupposition.
1731 | So it looks like we have a distinction
1732 | between consciousness and our conception of consciousness.
1733 | This thing on the blackboard is a conception of consciousness.
1734 | But the nature of this object is that distinction
1735 | between this and the whole thing is overcome.
1736 | Consciousness in its own self provides its own standard
1737 | and the investigation will therefore be a comparison
1738 | of itself, of it with itself, for the difference
1739 | which has just been made falls within consciousness.
1740 | That is to say, consciousness itself
1741 | has a conception of this.
1742 | So this difference between consciousness
1743 | and being in itself falls within consciousness
1744 | because consciousness is consciousness.
1745 | We can also know if I was a better drawer,
1746 | I could have put this thought bubble inside consciousness.
1747 | Hard to draw with chalk.
1748 | Consciousness is its own self, provides its own standard.
1749 | So consciousness brings with it a standard
1750 | of what knowledge is.
1751 | Therefore, skipping again a few sentences,
1752 | therefore in what consciousness declares within itself
1753 | to be the in itself or the true, we have the standard
1754 | which consciousness itself sets up to measure its known.
1755 | So consciousness has a standard, it has to know this.
1756 | That sets a standard.
1757 | If we designate knowing as the concept,
1758 | but designate the essence or the true over here
1759 | as what is or the object, then the examining consists
1760 | in whether the concept corresponds to the object.
1761 | Does this correspond to that?
1762 | Is this a way of knowingly relating to that?
1763 | Well remember, what relation knowing is also,
1764 | it's up to consciousness to say.
1765 | So don't assume that it's true justified belief
1766 | or whatever.
1767 | Let me just go a little bit further.
1768 | Oh, 84.
1769 | End of 84.
1770 | What is essential throughout the whole investigation
1771 | is to hold fast to this, that both of these moments,
1772 | concept and object, being for another,
1773 | being for consciousness and being in itself,
1774 | themselves fall within the knowing that we are investigating.
1775 | They fall within consciousness.
1776 | They fall within consciousness's conception
1777 | of itself as known.
1778 | And that we thus do not need to bring standards with us
1779 | and in the investigation to apply our ideas and thoughts.
1780 | But now you might think, okay,
1781 | isn't Hegel running into one horn
1782 | of the dilemma of the criterion?
1783 | Every conception of knowing is just going to agree
1784 | with its own standard.
1785 | No, Hegel's about target.
1786 | That actually shapes of consciousness in general
1787 | do not agree with their own standard.
1788 | However, from this aspect,
1789 | not only will it be superfluous for us to add anything,
1790 | and not only because concept and object,
1791 | the standard and what is to be examined
1792 | are present in consciousness itself,
1793 | the only thing that remains is for us to purely look on.
1794 | So now this is a super important aspect
1795 | of the way Hegel does philosophy.
1796 | And this is the first instance of it
1797 | that we've seen in the phenomenology.
1798 | Hegel's philosophy is supposed to always be imminent.
1799 | That means there's some subject matter
1800 | and the further development of the claims
1801 | about that subject matter in Hegel's philosophy
1802 | arise from the subject matter itself.
1803 | That means at no point in the phenomenology
1804 | can Hegel say, look, it's plausible that this,
1805 | or I think that, or in my view this,
1806 | everything has to come out of consciousness itself.
1807 | And since the beginning of the phenomenology
1808 | is natural consciousness,
1809 | it has to arise from natural consciousness itself.
1810 | So what we do in the phenomenology
1811 | is we just observe natural consciousness
1812 | developing itself through these shapes of consciousness
1813 | to absolute knowing.
1814 | It is consciousness of what to it is the true.
1815 | So it's consciousness of this
1816 | as well as consciousness of its knowing of the truth.
1817 | So it's conscious not only of this,
1818 | but of this whole thing.
1819 | So it's object consciousness,
1820 | but also consciousness of itself as knowing
1821 | under a particular description of what knowing is.
1822 | It is an issue for that consciousness
1823 | whether or not it's knowing of the object
1824 | corresponds to the object.
1825 | So consciousness cannot be indifferent
1826 | to whether this agrees with that.
1827 | Because it itself has supplied the criteria.
1828 | Okay, so we're gonna somehow argue
1829 | that various shapes of consciousness
1830 | fail their own criteria.
1831 | That they think this is a knowing of that,
1832 | but this as they themselves conceive it
1833 | is not a knowing of that.
1834 | Okay, we'll take one a little bit
1835 | and then we'll take a break
1836 | and then we'll read the last three paragraphs
1837 | really carefully.
1838 | This dialectical movement.
1839 | Ah, okay, so you've been wondering,
1840 | you're taking a Hegel class
1841 | and he's been doing it for two hours.
1842 | He hasn't said the word dialectic yet.
1843 | Okay.
1844 | Dialectic.
1845 | Hegel.
1846 | In some sense, all of Hegel's philosophy
1847 | works by something called the dialectic
1848 | or dialectical progression.
1849 | I think the structure of the dialectic
1850 | in phenomenology is different
1851 | than the structure of the dialectic in the larger.
1852 | I don't understand the dialectic
1853 | of the philosophy of nature
1854 | or really the philosophy of spirit either,
1855 | but I really don't understand
1856 | the dialectic philosophy of nature.
1857 | No one really understands the dialectic philosophy of nature.
1858 | But what does Hegel mean by the word dialectic?
1859 | There's two historical sources that are relevant.
1860 | One, in ancient philosophy,
1861 | dialectic, very simply put,
1862 | is the science of refuting what other people say.
1863 | So it's a negative logical art
1864 | where you say something
1865 | and I reduce you to absurdity.
1866 | In Kant, there's something called the transcendental dialect.
1867 | Now the transcendental dialectic actually has three parts,
1868 | but Hegel always associates the dialectic with the antinomies.
1869 | The idea of the antinomies of pure reason
1870 | in the first critique is that reason itself
1871 | is subject to a dialectic.
1872 | So it's not that someone comes along and refutes reason,
1873 | reason refutes itself.
1874 | It refutes itself and so far as it assumes
1875 | that objects in space and time are things in themselves
1876 | because it forms this conception
1877 | of something called the unconditioned.
1878 | So you take something, you take its conditions
1879 | and then you take the complete sequence of its conditions.
1880 | And it has a proof that that sequence of conditions
1881 | terminates in an unconditioned first condition
1882 | and it has a proof that it cannot terminate,
1883 | that it goes on infinitely.
1884 | That's a contradiction.
1885 | And so the resolution to that contradiction, Kant thinks,
1886 | is to recognize that objects in space and time
1887 | are appearances and so there is no such thing
1888 | as the unconditioned totality of their conditions.
1889 | If you haven't taken 3.14,
1890 | that wouldn't really make a lot of sense to you,
1891 | but you should all just take 3.14.
1892 | Okay, who's taking 3.14?
1893 | Good, the rest of you should model yourselves
1894 | on those who are taking 3.14.
1895 | So what Hegel means by a dialectic
1896 | is as in ancient philosophy,
1897 | refutation is a negative, it's negative.
1898 | But as with Kant, it's not refutation by some other person.
1899 | It's not external refutation, it's self-refutation.
1900 | It's the self-refutation here in the phenomenology
1901 | of shapes of consciousness,
1902 | of conceptions of what knowledge is.
1903 | The difference between both ancient dialectic,
1904 | Kantian dialectic and Hegelian dialectic
1905 | is as we saw earlier, Hegel thinks that dialectic
1906 | is not purely negative.
1907 | It's productive or positive.
1908 | So when we dialectically undermine
1909 | the shape of consciousness,
1910 | we don't go, oh fuck, we have a contradiction.
1911 | That generates positive content.
1912 | What Hegel calls the determinant negation
1913 | of the refuted shape of consciousness,
1914 | which is the successor shape of consciousness,
1915 | which in a principled fashion, non-orbitarily,
1916 | attempts to resolve the contradiction
1917 | in the earlier shape of consciousness.
1918 | So no, that's why.
1919 | So that means the phenomenology of spirit
1920 | is the inner dialectic of knowing.
1921 | But it's not just refutation, it's also position.
1922 | It's also positive.
1923 | The self-refutation of one shape of consciousness
1924 | generates the next shape of consciousness.
1925 | And that's why it's important
1926 | that Hegel give us a principled function
1927 | from shape of consciousness n
1928 | to shape of consciousness n plus one.
1929 | Because otherwise, the imminence
1930 | of the phenomenology of spirit would be wrecked.
1931 | That is to say, we would have to supply it.
1932 | We'd be like, what's a reasonable
1933 | next shape of consciousness?
1934 | Well, this seems good.
1935 | And it would no longer be consciousness developing itself.
1936 | And so in a certain way, it would fall a foul
1937 | of the problem of the criterion.
1938 | Something external to consciousness
1939 | would be telling it what its next standard should be.
1940 | And consciousness would not be rationally obliged
1941 | to accept that.
1942 | So we require an in-principle account
1943 | of how one shape of consciousness
1944 | gives rise to the next shape of consciousness.
1945 | Okay, why don't we take a 10-minute break
1946 | and come back at 54 past?
1947 | If you are auditing this class
1948 | and you have not yet been added to Quirkus,
1949 | please come speak to me
1950 | and I will add you to Quirkus right now.
1951 | Hello.
1952 | Can I add it?
1953 | Yes, you just.
1954 | It makes me so warm.
1955 | Dial in.

[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE][PRE-LECTURE]

<thinking>
1. Have received Lecture 1 Part 1 transcript
2. Key insights from lecture:
   - Course structure covers entire Hegel system rather than just Phenomenology
   - Importance of reading texts carefully vs high-level summaries
   - Introduction of dialectical movement and its significance
   - Explanation of consciousness's self-examination process
3. Need to:
   - Read second part of lecture transcript
   - Update reading analysis with lecture insights
   - Integrate new understanding into conceptual map
4. Will check second lecture transcript first

[read_file for 'Transcripts/PHL316_hegel_jan7_02.txt'] Result:
   1 | to figure out whether you know that.
   2 | What criterion of knowledge should we apply?
   3 | Well, one thing we could do is apply
   4 | your own criteria of knowledge.
   5 | Maybe your criteria of knowledge is faith.
   6 | Let's say it's specifically Christian faith.
   7 | Okay, your knowledge claim meets that criterion.
   8 | But that was a little easy.
   9 | Anyone's knowledge claim is gonna meet their own criterion,
  10 | you would normally think.
  11 | So that surely can't be sufficient for knowledge.
  12 | Here's another possibility.
  13 | I'll apply another criterion, an external criterion.
  14 | Knowledge is the deliverance of natural science.
  15 | Natural science doesn't say anything about God,
  16 | says Richard Dawkins.
  17 | So therefore you don't know that God exists.
  18 | That was also a little easy.
  19 | It seemed totally questionable.
  20 | So that's the glum of the criteria.
  21 | Hegel's idea is that the first horn of the dilemma
  22 | isn't actually so easy.
  23 | Because in fact, these criteria,
  24 | these conceptions of knowledge
  25 | that natural consciousness generates
  26 | are typically incoherence of their object.
  27 | Now, you might ask, so one question you might have is,
  28 | well, okay, but I can think of some conception of knowledge
  29 | that isn't in the phenomenology of spirit that's coherent.
  30 | But that isn't, so to speak,
  31 | that isn't sort of argumentatively relevant
  32 | to the phenomenology of spirit.
  33 | The argument of phenomenology of spirit is if you just
  34 | start out with the most primitive thing from itself,
  35 | that will develop into knowledge that's so certain
  36 | that no skeptical doubt about it can be raised.
  37 | Okay, yeah, just one, and then we'll come on.
  38 | So, if consciousness alters the standard of knowing,
  39 | and then when the standard of knowing changes,
  40 | it seems that so does the object that it knows.
  41 | So that, how is there ever a one-on-one mapping
  42 | of the object and the standard of knowing?
  43 | How do they ever meet?
  44 | When you change the object of knowing,
  45 | you also change the knowledge
  46 | that you need to know the object.
  47 | And that's exactly what we're about to talk about.
  48 | Paragraph 87, page 57.
  49 | Okay, so for some reason that I actually don't really know,
  50 | the phenomenology is always cited by paragraph numbers.
  51 | So, in your papers, please cite it by paragraph number.
  52 | And just because I want to drill into your mind,
  53 | the fact that we are reading this at secondhand,
  54 | you're reading it through translation,
  55 | cite the marginal page numbers always,
  56 | whenever they're given any of our translations.
  57 | Because that's the sort of speak real thing.
  58 | The page in Pinkert's translation is just,
  59 | the page in what Terry Pinkert is telling you,
  60 | they will say.
  61 | In this exposition of the course of experience,
  62 | there is a moment through which the exposition
  63 | seems not to correspond
  64 | with what is ordinarily understood by experience.
  65 | Okay, let me just back up.
  66 | I skipped something.
  67 | This dialectical movement,
  68 | which consciousness practices in its own self,
  69 | this is 86,
  70 | insofar as for consciousness,
  71 | the new true object arises out of this movement
  72 | is properly what is called experience.
  73 | So Hegel's technical notion of experience
  74 | is not when you took a gap year
  75 | and traveled through Southeast Asia,
  76 | nor is it the Kantian notion of a synthesis of perceptions,
  77 | nor is it whatever Locke and Hume think about experience.
  78 | It's precisely that.
  79 | It's the dialectical movement
  80 | by which consciousness realizes
  81 | that its conception of knowledge is incoherent,
  82 | that it's not a way of knowing the object
  83 | that it takes itself to know
  84 | and generates a new conception of knowledge
  85 | and thereby generates a new conception
  86 | of the object of knowledge.
  87 | That's what experience is.
  88 | Okay.
  89 | Sorry, what?
  90 | Can you say it's true or there?
  91 | No, sorry.
  92 | Okay, in this exposition,
  93 | in this exposition of the course of experience,
  94 | there is a moment through which the exposition
  95 | seems not to correspond
  96 | with what is ordinarily understood by experience.
  97 | The transition, namely from the first object
  98 | and the knowing of it to the other object
  99 | about which one says that it is learned from experience
 100 | was specified in such a way
 101 | that the knowing of the first object
 102 | or the being for consciousness of the first in itself
 103 | is itself supposed to become the second object.
 104 | So Hegel's referring back to some stuff that I skipped,
 105 | so I'll just summarize it.
 106 | So Hegel's idea is if this is the first,
 107 | I'll just erase the thought bubble.
 108 | I'll erase the thought bubble
 109 | because the thought bubble is now just implied
 110 | in everything I said.
 111 | Everything that I, everything on the blackboard
 112 | until further notice is the name of the thought bubble
 113 | because the phenomenology is imminent to consciousness.
 114 | We're not talking about objects themselves.
 115 | We're talking about consciousness's conception of the object.
 116 | What consciousness says is the object of knowledge.
 117 | Not what we think the object is or what objects are.
 118 | Okay.
 119 | So Hegel has said, which he's now referring back to,
 120 | is that if this is the first shape of consciousness,
 121 | the new shape of consciousness
 122 | is that what consciousness knows,
 123 | the second object is the relationship
 124 | of the consciousness to the object in the first shape.
 125 | This relationship is what the object is.
 126 | I should actually probably know.
 127 | Okay.
 128 | Now why isn't it?
 129 | So let me give you an example.
 130 | Here's an example.
 131 | In Kant, the critique of theory is it begins
 132 | with what Kant thinks of as the natural presupposition.
 133 | I know things in themselves.
 134 | And I do throw through sensing.
 135 | That is, we're intuiting them.
 136 | The argument of the transcendental aesthetic
 137 | is that this does not relate you to things in themselves.
 138 | You don't know things in themselves.
 139 | You know their appearances to you.
 140 | So what you know is not this,
 141 | but how this relates to you
 142 | and how it relates to you in this way.
 143 | You know not this,
 144 | but how this appears to you in intuition.
 145 | So Hegel thinks when you find out that you don't know this,
 146 | that this is not a way of knowing this,
 147 | the next shape of consciousness is that what you know
 148 | is that things relating to you in this way.
 149 | So in the Kantian example,
 150 | this would be the appearance of things in themselves.
 151 | So you start out by claiming to know a certain object.
 152 | Your knowing isn't a way of knowing that object.
 153 | What it's a way of knowing
 154 | is how that object relates to you in that relation.
 155 | So that the second object is the relation
 156 | of the first object to consciousness in the first form.
 157 | Or it's the first relation of consciousness to the object.
 158 | By contrast, it ordinarily seems that we learn
 159 | from experience of the untruth of our first concept
 160 | in another object that we perhaps come across
 161 | serendipitously and extrinsically,
 162 | that the only thing that is left to us
 163 | is the pure grasping of what is in and for itself.
 164 | Ordinarily we assume that we think we know stuff
 165 | and then we come upon some other objects.
 166 | We go explore and we're like oh,
 167 | that's not what knowledge was,
 168 | but that's a merely empirical case
 169 | of undermining knowledge.
 170 | We're interested in a sort of categorical collapse
 171 | of an entire conception of knowledge,
 172 | not some particular things of knowledge.
 173 | That's like finding out that Fargo
 174 | is not the capital of North Dakota.
 175 | This observation of the matter is our addition,
 176 | whereby this series of, sorry,
 177 | however, based on the point of view given above,
 178 | the new object shows itself to have come to be
 179 | through a reversal of consciousness itself.
 180 | So this new object is, it comes to be
 181 | through the undermining of this shape of consciousness.
 182 | Then there's a kicker.
 183 | This observation of the matter,
 184 | namely that the object of the second shape of consciousness
 185 | is the first relation to the first object.
 186 | It's the appearing of things of themselves,
 187 | not things of themselves.
 188 | This observation of the matter is our addition,
 189 | whereby the series of experiences traversed
 190 | by consciousness is elevated into a scientific progression
 191 | and which is not there for the consciousness
 192 | that we are observing.
 193 | So this transition and the fact that the second object
 194 | is the first relation to the first object
 195 | is not, Hegel says, for consciousness.
 196 | It is for us.
 197 | What does that mean?
 198 | What that means is that if we draw the thought bubble,
 199 | this shape of consciousness conceives of itself
 200 | as knowing this object in this way,
 201 | but the fact that this object
 202 | is the first relation to the first object
 203 | is not something that it is in self-consciousness.
 204 | That is to say, the shape of consciousness
 205 | does not know that it arose from this.
 206 | It's not constitutive of this shape of consciousness
 207 | that it is aware of itself as the successor of this.
 208 | Because why would it be?
 209 | It's not constitutive to knowing this in this way
 210 | that you know that you arose from that.
 211 | This is our addition.
 212 | So there's a distinction in the phenomenology,
 213 | in every scene of the phenomenology,
 214 | between what is for us and what is for consciousness.
 215 | That is to say, there's a distinction between
 216 | what we say about consciousness
 217 | and what consciousness says about itself.
 218 | And what consciousness says about itself
 219 | has to always be imminently developed
 220 | from consciousness itself.
 221 | So the for us remarks can be preliminary
 222 | or they can indicate the shape of the science,
 223 | but they can't themselves be,
 224 | they can't include the undermining.
 225 | Otherwise, the imminence of the exposition would be.
 226 | So what we do scientifically is order these things
 227 | in this way.
 228 | But that, this thing undermines itself
 229 | is not something we do to it.
 230 | It does it to itself.
 231 | But we, what's sometimes referred to
 232 | as the phenomenological observer,
 233 | the reader and the author of the phenomenology,
 234 | we order these shapes of consciousness in this way.
 235 | And that generates a scientific development.
 236 | So now we have a principled reason
 237 | for the beginning, the order, and the end.
 238 | And in any Hegelian science,
 239 | you always have to ask yourself where it begins,
 240 | what the principle of movement of it is,
 241 | and where it ends.
 242 | Okay, reading a little bit further.
 243 | However, this is in fact also the same situation
 244 | already discussed above concerning the relation
 245 | of the exposition to skepticism.
 246 | Namely, that each and every result which emerges
 247 | from a non-truthful knowing should not coalesce
 248 | into an empty nothing,
 249 | but rather must necessarily be grasped
 250 | as a nothing of that of which it is the result.
 251 | A result which contains the truth
 252 | that the previous knowing has within itself.
 253 | So this result is not an abstract nothing.
 254 | It's not just the giving up on knowledge.
 255 | It's this determinant negation of this.
 256 | It's, there's something it isn't.
 257 | It isn't that.
 258 | It's for us specifically not that shape of consciousness
 259 | because that shape of consciousness undermined itself.
 260 | And this relation is what Hegel calls being the truth of.
 261 | So what that means is this,
 262 | when it thinks itself fully undermines itself,
 263 | and this is what resolves the problem in a principled way.
 264 | So this contains whatever was true in this.
 265 | Now that means truth is not on or off.
 266 | Things are not true or not.
 267 | Truth here is a relational notion,
 268 | being the truth of something else.
 269 | And so things can be more or less true.
 270 | This is the truth of that.
 271 | The third shape is the truth of the second shape.
 272 | As we do this, we get truer and truer.
 273 | Now truth for Hegel is gonna turn out to be
 274 | the agreement of something with its concept.
 275 | So what this is is,
 276 | knowledge becoming more and more
 277 | in agreement with its concept.
 278 | Now what is the concept of knowledge?
 279 | We don't know yet.
 280 | It's up to consciousness to say.
 281 | It's up to the exposition of the phenomenology
 282 | to unfold from consciousness what the concept
 283 | of knowledge is.
 284 | If we just said what the concept of knowledge is
 285 | from the beginning, we would be begging the question.
 286 | We would be falling into the second form
 287 | of the dilemma of the criteria.
 288 | Yeah.
 289 | Can you explain what it means for something
 290 | to contain the truth of something else?
 291 | In what sense does the thing on the left
 292 | contain the truth of it?
 293 | I mean in a certain way, this schematic diagram
 294 | is all that can be said about that.
 295 | What for something to contain the truth of something else
 296 | is for it to be the principled successor to that.
 297 | So X is the truth of Y if X is the principled successor
 298 | of Y in virtue of Y negating itself.
 299 | Yes.
 300 | Yes, I have a question.
 301 | You've been making a distinction between
 302 | what we say about consciousness
 303 | and what consciousness says for itself.
 304 | But anything we assert as consciousness says for itself,
 305 | we're saying it equals something.
 306 | Sorry, say that again?
 307 | Okay.
 308 | So there's the distinction between what we say
 309 | about consciousness, namely we order the past consciousness
 310 | and what consciousness says for itself.
 311 | But how can making this at all means
 312 | whatever the wire gets cut by others?
 313 | Yeah, okay.
 314 | So by consciousness, Hegel doesn't mean
 315 | like consciousness in general.
 316 | He means by a particular shape of consciousness.
 317 | Of course, we're conscious.
 318 | But when Hegel refers to something as consciousness,
 319 | he means it's consciousness and nothing more.
 320 | Not, and this goes back to a point from earlier,
 321 | not that it isn't in any way that further thing,
 322 | but it hasn't yet grasped itself as that further thing.
 323 | So Hegel won't call us consciousness,
 324 | although of course we're conscious,
 325 | because we are something more.
 326 | In particular, insofar as you are reading
 327 | the phenomenology of spirit,
 328 | you're always one step ahead of a shape of consciousness.
 329 | You always know something more than it about itself.
 330 | So you are not merely identical
 331 | with that shape of consciousness.
 332 | So one way of distinguishing this
 333 | is thinking about what a shape of consciousness
 334 | is implicitly and what it is explicitly.
 335 | All of these shapes of consciousness
 336 | are implicitly spirit.
 337 | They're implicitly absolute no.
 338 | Because they contain in themselves the imminent criteria,
 339 | which when thought through by themselves
 340 | will lead to absolute no.
 341 | But they are not explicitly absolute no.
 342 | So we are, I'm more than just implicitly consciousness.
 343 | I'm explicitly something more than consciousness.
 344 | And so Hegel won't refer to me
 345 | or himself as mere consciousness.
 346 | Yeah.
 347 | So choosing the successor of truth,
 348 | it's like, for example,
 349 | is there a absurd stage of consciousness?
 350 | That's the truth of the first stage of consciousness,
 351 | also preserved and disturbed in the system.
 352 | Yes, yes.
 353 | So the truth of is transitive.
 354 | So we're going to try to figure that out.
 355 | So you guys speak up.
 356 | Oh, we're going to be trying to figure that distinction
 357 | between consciousness as we felt a number more
 358 | and consciousness, what we can claim about it,
 359 | could be similar to how we can claim thought and object.
 360 | So we are making claims about consciousness
 361 | as it appears to us,
 362 | just to speak between us making a claim about consciousness
 363 | and consciousness as it's also looking more important.
 364 | Yes, except that our claims about consciousness
 365 | are not supposed to be one of the shapes of consciousness
 366 | in this sequence.
 367 | Thank you.
 368 | Okay, let me just, let me just,
 369 | let's just read a little bit further.
 370 | However, this is in fact also the same situation
 371 | already discussed above concerning the relation
 372 | of this exposition to skepticism,
 373 | namely that each and every result
 374 | which emerges from a non-truthful known
 375 | should not coalesce into an empty nothing.
 376 | So not just the rejection of knowledge,
 377 | but rather must be necessarily grasped
 378 | as the nothing of that of which it is the result,
 379 | or result which contains the truth
 380 | that the previous knowing has within itself.
 381 | Here it presents itself as follows.
 382 | Well, what at first appeared as the object
 383 | generating for consciousness into a knowing of the object,
 384 | and in itself becomes a being for consciousness
 385 | of the in itself, the latter is the new object,
 386 | the being of consciousness for the in itself.
 387 | That's this point.
 388 | The being of consciousness for the object is the new object.
 389 | The previous being of object,
 390 | being of the object for consciousness,
 391 | that's what this is, is the new object.
 392 | As a result, a new shape of consciousness comes on the scene
 393 | for which the essence is something different
 394 | from what was the essence for the preceding shape.
 395 | Okay, so let me just say something about the word essence.
 396 | Hegel has this, the word here is vesen.
 397 | So now vesen in German is more general
 398 | than essence in English.
 399 | It can be a being, like an entity can also be a vesen.
 400 | So what Hegel means by vesen is whatever the standard
 401 | of whatever it is that knowledge has to correspond to
 402 | in order to count as knowledge.
 403 | So you might think, well, isn't that just
 404 | what the object is?
 405 | Yes, at the beginning, but over the course
 406 | of the phenomenology, something other than the object
 407 | is going to come to count as the vesen.
 408 | So the progress of the phenomenology is that consciousness,
 409 | knowing something that's an object will turn out
 410 | to be incoherent.
 411 | And then the vesen will turn out to be the subject.
 412 | It will turn out to be that what the subject has to do
 413 | in order to know objects is come into an agreement
 414 | with itself.
 415 | But we're not going to actually read those sections
 416 | of phenomenology.
 417 | So just understand, vesen is like a functional term.
 418 | It means whatever is that which knowledge has to correspond
 419 | to or agree with in order to be knowledge.
 420 | But for now, the object is playing the vesen term.
 421 | And in fact, consciousness is more or less identified,
 422 | or identical for Hegel, with a conception of knowledge
 423 | with the object plays the role of vesen.
 424 | Okay, this is what's so great about only teaching
 425 | the easy parts of Hegel.
 426 | In case you're wondering, this is like the easiest
 427 | ten pages of Hegel.
 428 | Okay, as a result of, if you guys go,
 429 | oh, I don't know how I'm getting through this,
 430 | like you have no idea, like it won't get that bad
 431 | in this class, but it gets infinitely worse than this.
 432 | As a result, a new shape of consciousness comes on the scene,
 433 | you can already read that, is this circumstance
 434 | which guides the whole series of shapes of consciousness
 435 | in their necessity.
 436 | So that's super crucial.
 437 | The progression of the shapes of consciousness
 438 | has to be necessary.
 439 | There has to be no arbitrariness or contingency
 440 | in one shape of consciousness being the successor
 441 | to the previous one.
 442 | That's why the merely historical reading
 443 | of the phenomenology has to be wrong.
 444 | The fact that one shape of consciousness
 445 | historically succeeds another,
 446 | it does not by itself demonstrate any necessity.
 447 | So if all this were, were a super high level
 448 | philosophical account of intellectual history,
 449 | it would demonstrate nothing about necessity.
 450 | What it could be, so there's like the pure historical reading,
 451 | this is literally just a catalog of what happens in history
 452 | but described in terms of historical period
 453 | self conceptions, that can't be right.
 454 | What it could be right is it's a description, it's that,
 455 | plus each of those historically extant conceptions
 456 | of knowledge incoherently undermines itself
 457 | and necessitates the next one.
 458 | So that's a little bit better, still wrong because A,
 459 | Hegel explicitly says that it's false,
 460 | the book ends, Hegel says something that's completely
 461 | in the battle with that, which we will read.
 462 | And furthermore, the chronology is wrong.
 463 | In fact, Newtonian science occurred after the ancient Greeks.
 464 | So, sorry guys, okay.
 465 | There's very few pure historical readers
 466 | of the phenomenology of the spirit left
 467 | but I have like a bad reaction to this
 468 | because I survived my first Hegel class partly
 469 | by just ingesting Michael Forster's book
 470 | about the phenomenology of the spirit.
 471 | The first half of which is very good,
 472 | it's all about Hegel's response to skepticism
 473 | but the rest of which is just the pure intellectual
 474 | distribution of phenomenology, which is very,
 475 | which is bad in pernicious.
 476 | However, it is just this necessity itself
 477 | or the emergence of the new object
 478 | which presents itself to consciousness
 479 | without consciousness knowing how this happens to it.
 480 | So this consciousness is unaware of its own history.
 481 | Now at a certain point in the phenomenology,
 482 | that will change and a shape of consciousness
 483 | will become explicitly self-conscious
 484 | of its development out of logically prior
 485 | to self-consciousness.
 486 | But we're not there yet.
 487 | Through this, there enters into the movement
 488 | of consciousness a moment of the in itself
 489 | or of being for us.
 490 | So this is a different use of in itself.
 491 | So sometimes Hegel uses in itself to mean this.
 492 | Sometimes what Hegel means but in itself
 493 | is a contrast between what is in itself and for itself.
 494 | And that approximately means what something
 495 | implicitly is without grasping it.
 496 | And for itself, what explicitly it is
 497 | what it grasps itself as such.
 498 | So let me give you an example.
 499 | Let's use the standard bad movie, The Hero.
 500 | Luke Skywalker is the savior of the galaxy
 501 | and the savior of the Jedi in himself from the beginning.
 502 | But only in Return of the Jedi is he that form himself.
 503 | I shy away from Star Wars examples
 504 | because I find that they're one of the few pieces
 505 | of pop culture that I share, that I know,
 506 | that my students also know.
 507 | And so then I tend to use them too much.
 508 | And then people think that I'm way more into Star Wars.
 509 | So then I will try, I will try to use the Star Wars
 510 | reference experiment.
 511 | Theologically, Jesus is the son of God in himself
 512 | before he takes on or accepts that identity.
 513 | Then he is the son of God for himself.
 514 | It is this circumstance, however it is just this necessity.
 515 | So these shapes of consciousness are in themselves
 516 | gauges on the path to absolute nothing.
 517 | But they are not those for themselves
 518 | because consciousness is not aware of that.
 519 | And in the phenomenology, the in itself,
 520 | but not for itself, can be identified with what is for us
 521 | and not for consciousness.
 522 | So in the phenomenology we can identify these risks,
 523 | what is for us, and what is for consciousness.
 524 | Okay.
 525 | So just a note on Hegelian tactical terminology.
 526 | People, I've had this experience multiple times
 527 | that students would be like,
 528 | I've been reading the phenomenology on my own
 529 | and I totally get it.
 530 | Could you just tell me though what the in itself
 531 | and the for itself are?
 532 | And the reason that question is very hard to answer
 533 | and slightly frustrating to be asked
 534 | is the meaning of Hegel's tactical terminology,
 535 | like everything else, has to be developed
 536 | imminently over the course of the science.
 537 | So these are to some extent like my external remarks
 538 | because I've read this book many times helping you along.
 539 | But properly speaking, the meaning of the in itself
 540 | or the for itself is going to change
 541 | over the course of the phenomenology.
 542 | So the only thing that we can say
 543 | that's like genuinely true illuminating
 544 | is some kind of like general structural features
 545 | of how these terms are used.
 546 | And in particular, when we get to the logic,
 547 | I'll actually, the in itself is actually in the part
 548 | of the logic we want to talk about.
 549 | The logic develops in principle and purely imminently
 550 | the pure technical meaning of these terms.
 551 | Which does not present itself for the consciousness
 552 | which is itself comprehended in the experience itself.
 553 | However, the content of what emerges to us
 554 | is for consciousness.
 555 | And we comprehend only what is formal in it
 556 | or its pure emergence.
 557 | For consciousness, what is emerged is only as object.
 558 | That is to say, what's emerged is an object
 559 | that it claims to know.
 560 | For us, what is emerged is that the same time emerges
 561 | as movement and coming to be.
 562 | But we understand this as having come to be from that.
 563 | Well remember, movement is just the name
 564 | for this purely conceptual process
 565 | of one conception of knowledge undermining itself
 566 | and giving rise purely logically to another.
 567 | And this process and this movement
 568 | is not happening in time.
 569 | Okay, through this necessity, this path to science
 570 | is itself already science.
 571 | Earlier he said, this doesn't appear to be science,
 572 | but now he's telling you, this is actually science.
 573 | But we don't know what science is.
 574 | So that is a provisional remark for something
 575 | that will have to be proven by the end of the book.
 576 | In fact, in doing the science of logic,
 577 | sorry, the phonology of spirit,
 578 | we are actually doing science.
 579 | This is actually scientific now.
 580 | And according to its content, it is thereby the science
 581 | of the experience of consciousness.
 582 | Okay, now those of you who pay very close attention,
 583 | actually this may not have been in the reading,
 584 | but if you have a copy of the book,
 585 | you'll notice that the title page of this book
 586 | is Science of the Experience of Consciousness.
 587 | So if you look at this book, it has one title page
 588 | that says, Phenomenology of Spirit,
 589 | and then it has a preface and an introduction.
 590 | And then there's another title page saying,
 591 | Science of the Experience of Consciousness.
 592 | Why does this book have two titles?
 593 | The reason is that the original title of this book
 594 | was the Science of the Experience of Consciousness.
 595 | Halfway through the book, Hegel decided
 596 | that it needed a second half
 597 | and that it should bear the title,
 598 | Phenomenology of Spirit.
 599 | The problem is the first half of the book had been printed.
 600 | And in the early 19th century,
 601 | paper is very, very valuable.
 602 | So the printer was not gonna pulp half of a book.
 603 | So instead, they printed the rest of the book
 604 | with the original title page
 605 | and then just added another title page.
 606 | And you can in fact,
 607 | that card first has proven this
 608 | by examining the very most original first editions
 609 | of the Phenomenology of Spirit.
 610 | So here at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library,
 611 | we have one of the very early editions,
 612 | but there were even earlier ones.
 613 | This is maybe boring, but it's extremely interesting
 614 | to me, so I'm gonna bore you with it.
 615 | There was a practice.
 616 | So book publishers were also booksellers in,
 617 | sorry, printers were also booksellers
 618 | in the early 19th century.
 619 | So a publisher or a printer that was publishing a book,
 620 | you could subscribe to that book
 621 | and they would send you the parts of the book
 622 | as they were getting printed.
 623 | So an 18th century book is printed
 624 | on these gigantic pieces of paper
 625 | that are folded together and then they print off them.
 626 | You could subscribe and as those got printed,
 627 | they would send them to you.
 628 | And then when the whole thing was done,
 629 | you would send it back, they would bind it together
 630 | and then you'd have your book.
 631 | And so Eckhart first found one of these
 632 | of the Phenomenology of Spirit
 633 | and he proved on the basis of the folds of the page
 634 | that the original first fold of the Phenomenology of Spirit
 635 | has the title, Science of the Experience of Consciousness
 636 | and then when they asked for everybody's folds back,
 637 | they cut off a couple of pages
 638 | and then added the rest of it.
 639 | And he has a claim about these various pages
 640 | in Hegel's not lost the papers that were left
 641 | over his death about what those missing pages are.
 642 | This unfortunately is not something
 643 | we're gonna be able to cover in this class.
 644 | Now I realize that this may be very sad.
 645 | Okay, so why did he go from calling it
 646 | a science of the experience of consciousness
 647 | to the Phenomenology of Spirit?
 648 | Because the original plan of the book
 649 | is that it ends, so the book was originally supposed
 650 | to contain consciousness, self-consciousness,
 651 | and reason.
 652 | Spirit is where the, this is the original plan.
 653 | This is the original plan.
 654 | This is something called the Four Phenomenology.
 655 | This is where the second half of the book starts.
 656 | So the original plan of the book
 657 | didn't have the spirit section.
 658 | So then for some reason, Hegel decided
 659 | the book needed a second half
 660 | that includes spirit, religion, and absolute damage.
 661 | Yeah, spirit, religion, and absolute damage.
 662 | And he decided that what the whole thing is
 663 | is not just the science of the experience of consciousness
 664 | but the Phenomenology of Spirit.
 665 | So really, this is what was originally
 666 | the science of the experience of consciousness.
 667 | So now it's possible, and this is the kind of thing
 668 | that we would have to deal with
 669 | if we were doing a class of the whole Phenomenology,
 670 | that this description of the project of the Phenomenology
 671 | applies only to this.
 672 | And then, imminently, within the reason section,
 673 | we transition to a different project.
 674 | I don't think that's quite right, but regardless,
 675 | what does it mean that the whole thing
 676 | is a Phenomenology of Spirit?
 677 | Okay, so now this goes back to a question
 678 | that was asked earlier.
 679 | Who asked this question?
 680 | The meeting of Phenomenology.
 681 | Yes, Isaac, okay.
 682 | So Phenomenology, right, just linguistically,
 683 | means the logos of Phenomena.
 684 | Oh, this board is really messy, I apologize for that.
 685 | But it might just, you know, they do not need to,
 686 | they do not need to add weight for this.
 687 | Okay, Phenomenology.
 688 | This is the logos, or the rational account of Phenomena,
 689 | of Appearance.
 690 | So this is the science of the Appearance of Spirit.
 691 | So it's the scientific account of how Spirit appears
 692 | up until, or up and until, Spirit is fully
 693 | in and for itself.
 694 | It's fully explicit for itself that it's Spirit.
 695 | Now, what is the appearance of Spirit?
 696 | It's not like Spirit is, it's the appearance
 697 | of Spirit to Spirit.
 698 | It's the appearance of Spirit to consciousness.
 699 | Consciousness is ever more adequate conception
 700 | of itself as Spirit.
 701 | So this is what I was talking about before.
 702 | That means consciousness is ever more truthful,
 703 | ever more adequate conception of it not being
 704 | fundamentally different from anything else.
 705 | Of there not being anything that's radically distinct
 706 | from Spirit.
 707 | There's no outside to Spirit.
 708 | There are things that are distinct from Spirit,
 709 | but their fundamental structure is the same
 710 | as the structure of Spirit.
 711 | And so all of being, all of reality is in principle
 712 | transparent to Spirit.
 713 | It's in principle transparent to knowing.
 714 | Okay, so that means that this introduction
 715 | is not an introduction to the Phenomenology of Spirit.
 716 | It's an introduction to the science of the Experience
 717 | of Consciousness.
 718 | That's why there's no explanation of why it's called
 719 | a Phenomenology of Spirit.
 720 | Although there is an explanation of why it's the science
 721 | of the Experience of Consciousness.
 722 | And it means that something really important happened
 723 | because Hegel decided that the book could not end here.
 724 | So once again, in a complete account of the Phenomenology
 725 | of Spirit, we would have to,
 726 | this transition is really crucial.
 727 | Why does the book not end with reason?
 728 | Why does it move to Spirit?
 729 | And what is the particular nature of Spirit?
 730 | Okay, so let's just do the last paragraph.
 731 | The experience through which consciousness learns
 732 | about itself can, according to its concept,
 733 | comprehend within itself nothing less
 734 | than the whole system of consciousness.
 735 | Okay, so this is an obsession of German philosophy
 736 | between Kant and Hegel, the systematicity of science.
 737 | So we don't wanna just have science.
 738 | Science has to be a system.
 739 | However, Hegel hasn't imminently justified
 740 | the notion of system.
 741 | That he's gonna have to do.
 742 | So this is a provisional remark
 743 | for something that's gonna come.
 744 | And we'll talk about when we get to Hegel's system,
 745 | in what way it's systematic.
 746 | Nothing less than the whole system of consciousness
 747 | or the whole realm of the truth of spirit.
 748 | So the moments of truth present themselves
 749 | in this, their proper determinateness,
 750 | not as being abstract pure moments,
 751 | but rather in the way that they are for consciousness
 752 | or in the way that consciousness itself comes
 753 | on the scene in relation to that.
 754 | In this way, the moments of the whole
 755 | are shapes of consciousness.
 756 | So the moments of the whole are the individual aspects
 757 | or parts of this development
 758 | from natural consciousness to absolute known.
 759 | By consciousness carrying a word
 760 | on towards its true existence,
 761 | it will reach a point where it sets aside
 762 | its semblance of being burdened with what is alien.
 763 | So the end point of the phenomenology is willing to be
 764 | in part giving up what Hegel here describes
 765 | as a semblance, the idea that consciousness is burdened
 766 | with an object distinct from itself that it has to know.
 767 | Absolute knowing, as I said before,
 768 | is gonna involve some kind of getting rid
 769 | of the distinctness of the object
 770 | or a collapse of the subject and the object together
 771 | so that no possible distinction
 772 | between subject and object can arise
 773 | that would generate the skeptical problems
 774 | that undermine previous shapes of consciousness.
 775 | A point where the appearance becomes equal to the essence,
 776 | the essence being that which has to be known,
 777 | the appearance being its relationship to consciousness,
 778 | so that its own exposition coincides at this very point
 779 | with the genuine science of spirit
 780 | so that this exposition will itself also have been,
 781 | will turn out to be a scientific knowing of what spirit is.
 782 | Finally, while itself grasping this, its own essence,
 783 | consciousness will signify the nature
 784 | of absolute knowing itself.
 785 | So just to anticipate slightly spoiler alert,
 786 | this joke that people like to make on Twitter,
 787 | the real journey, the real destination
 788 | was the friends we made along the way.
 789 | This is in a certain way the key idea of Hegel.
 790 | Or the slightly less jokey version,
 791 | the journey is the destination.
 792 | That in a certain way, I'll try to justify this philosophically
 793 | over the course of this semester
 794 | and make this not sound so silly.
 795 | That in a certain way is the key idea of Hegel.
 796 | That actually, what absolute knowing is going to be,
 797 | is going to turn out to be what we've been doing all along.
 798 | So the end of the phenomenology of spirit,
 799 | the end of all of Hegel's books
 800 | have this weird, dissatisfying character.
 801 | You're like, wait, I wanted to know what absolute knowing was.
 802 | Why can't you tell me?
 803 | And the answer is, you've been owning absolutely all along.
 804 | But you've been absolutely knowing in itself.
 805 | At the end, you have absolute knowledge for itself.
 806 | You absolutely, you explicitly grasp
 807 | what you've been doing all along as absolute knowing.
 808 | And that is one of the reasons,
 809 | if the journey is the destination,
 810 | then the content of Hegel's philosophy,
 811 | the P in Hegel, is the way you get to the P.
 812 | They're inseparable.
 813 | Which means Hegel cannot cut to the chase.
 814 | That means there's no way for Hegel to communicate
 815 | the so-called content of Hegel's thought,
 816 | other than by you doing it yourself.
 817 | That is why the books are so hard to read.
 818 | You have to rethink every of Hegel's ideas
 819 | in order to understand every one of the claims.
 820 | There's no choice in reading Hegel,
 821 | but to recapitulate the thought of Hegel
 822 | in grasping the thought of Hegel.
 823 | If there was a distinction between form and content,
 824 | there could be P, and there could be my argument that P,
 825 | and those would be different things.
 826 | But for Hegel, they're one and the same.
 827 | Which means that they aren't a value of P.
 828 | Because P cannot be identical to an argument that P.
 829 | I mean, it's a very bad argument that P.
 830 | I mean, it's a value, right?
 831 | And for many values of P, it is sound as well.
 832 | But still, a very valid argument.
 833 | So in some sense, where the phenomenology of spirit
 834 | is going to end is that this has been absolute knowing
 835 | all along.
 836 | Sounds super weird, sounds kind of oaky,
 837 | sounds slightly new-agey.
 838 | But I hope that I will be able to false off and justify it
 839 | as not totally stupid over the course of this much.
 840 | Okay, we have some time.
 841 | I just want to say, those who have taken classes
 842 | with me before know that I tend not to keep to the syllabus,
 843 | I tend to slow down.
 844 | I think in my entire life,
 845 | I have never actually kept to a syllabus.
 846 | I think one time, I only was like one week behind,
 847 | or even like half a week behind.
 848 | It's possible that I will slow down from the syllabus.
 849 | But there is, I have in my mind,
 850 | a kind of condensed version where we can speed
 851 | through certain things,
 852 | and we'll still start at the beginning and get to the end.
 853 | So we'll see the big structure of Hegel's system,
 854 | even if we speed through certain things
 855 | or slow down on other things.
 856 | Questions?
 857 | Yes.
 858 | So when they say P is the right to get to the P,
 859 | so what's the meaning of experience?
 860 | Experience is, as Hegel says,
 861 | consciousness undermining one's conception of knowledge,
 862 | which gives rise to another conception of knowledge.
 863 | That's what experience is.
 864 | In a certain way, absolute knowing
 865 | is not the experience of consciousness,
 866 | but the science of the experience of consciousness.
 867 | It's that experience in its systematic totalitarian,
 868 | a principled beginning, a principled law of the series,
 869 | and a principled end.
 870 | Yeah.
 871 | So is consciousness here a proper noun,
 872 | like as you're referring to an entity,
 873 | or is it just a functional world,
 874 | like in point to that you're conscious of something
 875 | that's like a function, not like an entity by itself?
 876 | I mean, my inclination is to respond to you
 877 | by saying that that's a false dichotomy,
 878 | because functions are entities,
 879 | and consciousness is definitely a noun, just grammatically.
 880 | But I feel like there's something
 881 | that's more behind your question.
 882 | So what lies behind this question?
 883 | So what lies behind the question is that if consciousness
 884 | is just a functional world and just a status that I just,
 885 | that something is always cognizing,
 886 | or like conscious of something,
 887 | and that process is like constantly rebooting itself,
 888 | and it's not aware that it's even clear of itself,
 889 | so it's always for itself.
 890 | If consciousness is a proper noun,
 891 | as like you're referring to an entity,
 892 | then it can sort of like have passed and recognize
 893 | the always immediately present in the world.
 894 | Okay, so what I would say is,
 895 | we're talking about consciousness,
 896 | we're not talking about particular conscious subject.
 897 | Why are we doing that?
 898 | Because we're not interested in this conscious subject
 899 | or that conscious subject,
 900 | we're interested in what consciousness is.
 901 | Okay, now, so we're at one level
 902 | above individual conscious subject.
 903 | Furthermore, consciousness is relational.
 904 | Consciousness is consciousness of something else.
 905 | In fact, even consciousness will turn into self-consciousness,
 906 | which does not mean that consciousness is not self-conscious
 907 | in the ordinary sense from the beginning,
 908 | because as you see, consciousness has a conception
 909 | of itself as consciousness.
 910 | That is to say, in the ordinary sense, it's self-conscious.
 911 | So we're not gonna read in this class
 912 | the transition from consciousness to self-consciousness.
 913 | But there's this thing that people,
 914 | there's this reading that you sometimes hear
 915 | where somehow, human beings were not conscious
 916 | until they started fighting each other
 917 | and then they became self-conscious,
 918 | which is always very strict,
 919 | because animals manage to fight each other.
 920 | You look at them without being self,
 921 | put two babies together, they won't fight each other,
 922 | like wrestle with each other,
 923 | but that's not turned them into self,
 924 | makes them self-conscious.
 925 | Of self-consciousness as the second part
 926 | of the phenomenal energy of spirit
 927 | does not refer to self-consciousness
 928 | in the ordinary sense,
 929 | but the idea that what consciousness is of,
 930 | what knowledge is of,
 931 | the essence that makes knowledge knowledge
 932 | is consciousness is knowledge of itself.
 933 | So that consciousness,
 934 | it sort of speaks self-conscious knowledge of objects.
 935 | What it needs to know,
 936 | what it needs to match its representation to
 937 | is the object.
 938 | Self-consciousness is self-conscious knowledge of itself.
 939 | What it needs to match its representation to is itself,
 940 | including its representations of objects.
 941 | So consciousness for Hegel,
 942 | even self-consciousness is always relational,
 943 | even if it's a relation to itself.
 944 | So in that sense, maybe that's what you mean by functional.
 945 | Consciousness is not, so to speak, an intrinsic property.
 946 | Does your ever-subscribing impact on Hegel's ideal
 947 | implicit and explicit?
 948 | Yes.
 949 | Hegel says at the beginning of the philosophy of spirit
 950 | that the only thing worth reading about mind,
 951 | aside from, of course, him, is Aristotle's Diana.
 952 | Maybe not the only thing,
 953 | the best thing ever given by the mind is Diana.
 954 | So Hegel thinks of himself,
 955 | Hegel's attitude towards true philosophy,
 956 | which we will get to at the end of the course,
 957 | is that the history of philosophy is,
 958 | all of these things that we're gonna describe in Hegel,
 959 | so there is a, one of the many distorted ways
 960 | in which Hegel has been received
 961 | is to think of Hegel as fundamentally
 962 | a philosopher of history.
 963 | Hegel is a philosopher of history.
 964 | Maybe, probably the best,
 965 | deepest philosopher of history ever.
 966 | But the stuff that we're talking about is not historical.
 967 | The fundamental stuff in Hegel is not historical.
 968 | So the logic is not about history.
 969 | The logic is not about historical categories,
 970 | the development of the logic is not historical or temple.
 971 | It's eternal outside of time.
 972 | But Hegel thinks those eternal metaphysical logical
 973 | structures are realized over time
 974 | in human history in philosophy.
 975 | So what the history of philosophy is,
 976 | is the history of philosophers grasping
 977 | incompletely mutilated non-systematic parts
 978 | of the complete systematic self-development
 979 | of non-physical categories.
 980 | So once you have Hegel's logic on board,
 981 | you can then look back through the history of philosophy
 982 | and see aspects of it manifest themselves
 983 | in Parmenides, Heraclitus, Plato, Aristotle, et cetera.
 984 | Hegel is very dismissive of the medieval
 985 | in his lecture of the history of philosophy.
 986 | And then there were some medieval.
 987 | Let's ignore that.
 988 | Let's start up with Descartes, okay?
 989 | And really just get to the Germans as quickly as possible.
 990 | And so Hegel's, we're gonna end the class
 991 | by reading a little bit of Hegel's lectures
 992 | on the history of philosophy.
 993 | Hegel thinks to confirm this theory,
 994 | you have to go back through the history of philosophy
 995 | and see this self-developing system
 996 | of metaphysical structures, which is called the idea.
 997 | You have to see it present in the history of philosophy,
 998 | just as you have to see in the history of art,
 999 | you have to find in the history of art
1000 | the artistic presentation of the idea,
1001 | the presentation of the idea in pictures
1002 | and sculptures and music, et cetera.
1003 | And you have to find in the history of religion
1004 | the religious presentation of the idea,
1005 | the presentation of the idea in mythology,
1006 | in spiritual practice, in holy scriptures, et cetera.
1007 | Yeah?
1008 | What would be the tell-off of history?
1009 | Of what?
1010 | Of history?
1011 | No, of his system, like the ultimate.
1012 | The short answer is-
1013 | The historian says the ultimate form,
1014 | like the perfect open form.
1015 | Reason fully and entirely grasping,
1016 | that's all the best reason.
1017 | Yeah?
1018 | So when history uses phenomenology-
1019 | Oh, excellent, yeah, I didn't answer
1020 | the original question, yeah, thank you.
1021 | So yeah, so the phenomenology in Hegel
1022 | is just the science of how science appears,
1023 | that is to say, shapes of apparent claims
1024 | to knowledge that are not knowledge.
1025 | So the science of the experience of consciousness
1026 | could also be called the phenomenology of knowledge.
1027 | And the phenomenology of spirit is the logos,
1028 | the science of how spirit appears to itself
1029 | as things that are not yet spirit.
1030 | It's spirit in itself but not yet for itself.
1031 | It's the scientific exposition of the stages of spirit
1032 | in itself but not yet for itself
1033 | up to and including spirit in and for itself.
1034 | Phenomenology in Husserl is this idea
1035 | that what first philosophy should be,
1036 | the replacement for metaphysics should be a science
1037 | where you just bracket the question
1038 | of whether the objects of consciousness
1039 | have any being outside of consciousness,
1040 | and you study the pure structure of consciousness.
1041 | Now, Hegel just thinks, okay, that's cool,
1042 | but we've already, we've seen that movie before.
1043 | It was called early modern histology.
1044 | My general view on, so one of the things
1045 | that's frustrating about the Hegel reception
1046 | is a lot of people think, oh, you know,
1047 | Hegel's a dead dog, let's reject Hegel,
1048 | but the objections to Hegel are largely terrible.
1049 | And then what's really frustrating
1050 | is people think they're gonna do this other thing.
1051 | And it's like, okay, that view is already a sub-model
1052 | of the phenomenology of spirit.
1053 | Like, Hegel is fully aware of that as a possibility.
1054 | He foresaw it and he refuted it.
1055 | So what are we doing here, guys?
1056 | What are we doing here?
1057 | Yeah, someone else, yes.
1058 | I was gonna say, how would Hegel explain
1059 | the kind of experience that, like,
1060 | you just go, like, more and more wrong,
1061 | for example, like, if I choose the wrong path
1062 | of argument in an essay, well, I believe that's true.
1063 | And I just go, like, more and more wrong,
1064 | like, just the wrong, and.
1065 | It's logically independent or orthogonal
1066 | to what Hegel is doing in the phenomenology of spirit.
1067 | The phenomenology of spirit is not psychology.
1068 | This is not a claim of a human psychology
1069 | or what human psychology does in respect,
1070 | in the face of error.
1071 | It's a logical claim about the nature of consciousness.
1072 | So you might not care that you're wrong,
1073 | but consciousness has such ducts.
1074 | And that's why, in general, consciousness,
1075 | when it discovers an incoherence
1076 | in its own self-conception alters it.
1077 | And one way of seeing that,
1078 | although this is not the theme of the phenomenology,
1079 | is this story is played out in history,
1080 | but it's not the topic of the phenomenology.
1081 | The key thing is that in absolute knowing
1082 | at the end of the book,
1083 | Hegel says spirit releases itself into history,
1084 | which means that all of this does happen in history,
1085 | but it doesn't happen in this order.
1086 | And that is not the topic of this book.
1087 | So these shapes of consciousness
1088 | are historically real.
1089 | And historically, when human societies recognize
1090 | that their conception of their relationship
1091 | to the world is incoherent,
1092 | they change, not immediately.
1093 | Sometimes they persist in the contradiction.
1094 | And then the undoing of that contradiction
1095 | can involve massive historical change.
1096 | For instance, my country is founded on the idea
1097 | that all men are created equal.
1098 | It was also founded on economic side
1099 | and the exploitation of enslaved people.
1100 | That's a contradiction.
1101 | You can either think of that contradiction
1102 | as having worked out in the Civil War
1103 | as we're still not being worked out.
1104 | But that's a perfect example of a Hegelian contradiction
1105 | worked out historically.
1106 | Yeah.
1107 | Does consciousness know a symbol
1108 | of becoming spirit in its beginning?
1109 | No.
1110 | Or like, so it only goes to my guess.
1111 | It gets some anticipation later on.
1112 | Later on, it's like you can see in the distance this thing
1113 | and it's like, that would be really awesome.
1114 | Early on, consciousness, as we'll see next week
1115 | when we talk about the first shape of consciousness,
1116 | the first shape of consciousness knows one thing.
1117 | This.
1118 | What's the grounds of the movement itself?
1119 | The grounds of the movement itself is the
1120 | the self-reputation of consciousness.
1121 | Yeah.
1122 | What limits consciousness from knowing the being?
1123 | Nothing.
1124 | What limits consciousness from knowing the in itself
1125 | is all of its conceptions of the in itself and knowing
1126 | short of absolute no.
1127 | So one way of thinking about the relationship
1128 | between Hegel and Kant is Kant thinks
1129 | that at least theoretically things themselves
1130 | are unavailable to us.
1131 | Hegel thinks nothing is unavailable to us.
1132 | There might be facts that are unknowable to us,
1133 | there might be details of my particular objects,
1134 | but there's nothing that is structurally
1135 | or logically unknowable to us.
1136 | Everything is in principle available
1137 | or transparent to spirit.
1138 | Consciousness and science of consciousness
1139 | both are events?
1140 | No, because events happen in time.
1141 | None of these, the phenomenology of spirit
1142 | is not about any events, it's not about any times.
1143 | Hegel illustrates various shapes of consciousness
1144 | with historical references.
1145 | But people who focus on those things
1146 | and take the phenomenology to be about them
1147 | in the words of my friend Marcus Gabriel
1148 | are expositing Hegel's examples, not Hegel.
1149 | They are scholars of Hegel's metaphors,
1150 | not of the phenomenology of spirit.
1151 | Yeah, in the back.
1152 | Yes, last section, paragraph 26.
1153 | There's two instances I, well, we were talking about that
1154 | in the book, but I'm not going to emphasize
1155 | how different from a point of decision between science
1156 | or the knowledge, apparent knowledge,
1157 | what true knowledge that we declare,
1158 | because it's like both and I guess not.
1159 | But like in time, science declares-
1160 | Just could you just tell me where in some instances?
1161 | Yeah, science declares its beam to me its power,
1162 | but I'm sure knowing this as much as fuel
1163 | to the fact that it is, and it gives out the assurance
1164 | that science counts as nothing,
1165 | so what does it mean, the science declares its beam
1166 | on the standard and-
1167 | Oh, so the idea is science says I am science.
1168 | So I know stuff.
1169 | But the person who doesn't have science,
1170 | but thinks they have science, can say the same thing.
1171 | They can give the same little speech,
1172 | because they both are.
1173 | Yes.
1174 | This is for the study of study of the last question,
1175 | but does Hegel ever provide an explicit justification
1176 | of how we can be certain that the conditions
1177 | for this whole progression are all identical to success?
1178 | How does he know that nature sort of never intervenes
1179 | in the progression of consciousness,
1180 | and that can all just sort of contain
1181 | within consciousness itself?
1182 | Okay, so that would be a problem if this were a description
1183 | of a concrete process happening in reality.
1184 | This is a purely logical or conceptual account.
1185 | So the word about nature intervening
1186 | or nature not cooperating is no more a problem
1187 | than this for a logic textbook.
1188 | If you said, how do you know that if P
1189 | then Q, then Q, nature might intervene.
1190 | Nature might, just at the moment you're concluding
1191 | that Q of earth, queen, or meteor might happen.
1192 | That's not a problem here.
1193 | That might be a problem for Hegel's theory of history.
1194 | When you get to Hegel's history,
1195 | Hegel's theory of history might have the problem
1196 | that well a meteor could come and not wipe out humanity.
1197 | I don't think it does have that problem,
1198 | but it is standardly read as having that problem.
1199 | Yeah.
1200 | Just from that hour or on science stuff,
1201 | a word is mentioned in the time that I don't understand,
1202 | it's the word imitation.
1203 | What's that?
1204 | Is that something like a reference to your way
1205 | of understanding the world?
1206 | Imitation is just something that pretends
1207 | to be something that it isn't.
1208 | So, you know, there's imitation cheese,
1209 | which is not cheese.
1210 | It's like made out of non-dairy products.
1211 | There's imitation crab, which is not crab.
1212 | It's all of the most repulsive,
1213 | inedible parts of some fish that's been reformed
1214 | to make it look like crab and die.
1215 | What is intimation?
1216 | Oh, intimation, sorry.
1217 | Oh, intimation.
1218 | Yeah, so an intimation is like when you kind of vaguely
1219 | sense that something is gonna happen,
1220 | but you can't really say exactly what.
1221 | So many of you have an intimation
1222 | that this class is gonna become
1223 | completely incomprehensible.
1224 | That's more than an intimation,
1225 | because I've more or less told you that that's gonna happen.
1226 | Yeah?
1227 | I'll ask you a question.
1228 | What is the word natural at to natural?
1229 | Good question.
1230 | I think what it means,
1231 | I think it's supposed to justify
1232 | why we start with the shape of consciousness
1233 | that we've given.
1234 | Namely, it's the most immediate
1235 | or least sophisticated possible shape of consciousness.
1236 | On the other hand, I mean, sorry,
1237 | I didn't ignore that, that's wrong.
1238 | What it means by calling that natural consciousness
1239 | is that that is the position
1240 | of philosophically untrue to common sense.
1241 | That's the natural starting point to think about knowledge.
1242 | I have a being, there's some other beings,
1243 | they're distinct from me.
1244 | I've gotta know about them.
1245 | How do I do that?
1246 | That leads you into the whole problem.
1247 | Yeah?
1248 | So, sorry, I'm trying to find a way to frame the phone.
1249 | So is there a sort of an original point of,
1250 | so the being for, the being in itself,
1251 | it seems to me it's for Hegel.
1252 | It's already at any rate sort of being schematized
1253 | already by the consciousness
1254 | so that it can make its presence into,
1255 | you know, a relationship in knowing.
1256 | So, which it's sort of,
1257 | a schematization is already a sort of,
1258 | a sort of derivation from the original being in itself.
1259 | So what you're right about is being in itself here
1260 | is the in itself of the object of knowledge,
1261 | or the object of consciousness,
1262 | which means that the in itself,
1263 | insofar as we cannot be conscious of it,
1264 | is not on the table.
1265 | But remember, the topic here is, what can we know?
1266 | So the in itself, insofar as we can't be conscious of it,
1267 | is definitely not a topic for epistemology.
1268 | Secondly, knowledge here, I just, I keep trying to,
1269 | knowledge is extremely general.
1270 | It's what, it is the relationship of consciousness
1271 | to a topic.
1272 | So if we can't be conscious of it,
1273 | this in itself that isn't even,
1274 | isn't the in itself of the object of consciousness.
1275 | If the in itself,
1276 | that can't even be an object of consciousness,
1277 | how do we even talk about it?
1278 | So it's just not relevant.
1279 | So the starting point, the original point of,
1280 | of dialect is when you take a little movement,
1281 | it's already in a mode of knowing, sort of.
1282 | Exactly, it's all of this is within a thought.
1283 | We're not talking,
1284 | the phenomena does not start with beings.
1285 | It starts with the relationship of consciousness to beings.
1286 | In particular, it starts with the relationship
1287 | of consciousness to beings as conceived by consciousness.
1288 | Everything is within a thought.
1289 | I'll see you next week.

[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE][PRE-LECTURE]

<thinking>
1. Have now reviewed both lecture transcripts which provide crucial context:
   - The original title was "Science of the Experience of Consciousness"
   - Important distinction between what is "for consciousness" vs "for us"
   - Experience as dialectical movement, not empirical experience
   - Nature of absolute knowing as journey/process
2. Need to update analyses to reflect these insights
3. Will start with reading analysis, then conceptual map

<content># Pre-Lecture Reading: Phenomenology of Spirit - Introduction

## Basic Information
- **Author**: G.W.F. Hegel
- **Date/Period**: 1807
- **Assigned For**: January 7, 2025
- **Pages/Sections**: Introduction (§73-89)

## Initial Engagement
Originally titled "Science of the Experience of Consciousness", this introduction sets up the methodological framework for examining how consciousness develops through necessary stages toward scientific knowing. The text challenges traditional epistemological assumptions while establishing a unique approach to philosophical investigation.

## Key Passages
```
It is a natural assumption that in philosophy, before we start to deal with its proper subject-matter, viz. the actual cognition of what truly is, one must first of all come to an understanding about cognition, which is regarded either as the instrument to get hold of the Absolute, or as the medium through which one discovers it.
```
**Significance**: Sets up traditional epistemological assumptions to be challenged, particularly the view that we must first understand cognition before using it.

```
Consciousness provides its own criterion from within itself, so that the investigation becomes a comparison of consciousness with itself
```
**Significance**: Establishes the immanent nature of the investigation - consciousness examines itself using its own standards.

## Central Concepts
1. **Experience (Erfahrung)**: Not empirical experience but the dialectical movement where consciousness discovers inadequacies in its conception of knowledge
2. **Natural Consciousness**: Initial, unreflective form of knowing that serves as starting point
3. **For Consciousness vs For Us**: Distinction between what appears to consciousness itself versus what we as observers understand about its development
4. **Dialectical Movement**: Self-generated progression where each shape of consciousness undermines itself necessarily

## Potential Arguments
1. The investigation must be immanent - standards come from consciousness itself
2. The progression must be necessary, not contingent
3. Each shape of consciousness contains the truth of the previous one through determinate negation

## Historical Context
Originally conceived as introduction to "Science of Experience of Consciousness" before Hegel expanded scope to full "Phenomenology of Spirit". Responds to traditional epistemological approaches while establishing new philosophical method.

## Difficult Sections
```
This observation of the matter is our addition, whereby the series of experiences traversed by consciousness is elevated into a scientific progression
```
**Difficulty**: Complex relationship between what consciousness experiences and how we understand its development
**Potential Interpretation**: While consciousness undergoes its own development, we observe and understand it scientifically, though this scientific understanding is not available to consciousness itself

## Questions for Lecture
1. How exactly does a shape of consciousness undermine itself through its own criteria?
2. What makes each transition necessary rather than contingent?
3. What is the relationship between the original project (Science of Experience of Consciousness) and final work (Phenomenology of Spirit)?
4. How does Hegel avoid both horns of the criterion dilemma?

## Hypotheses about Lecture Content
1. Lecture will establish methodological framework before examining specific shapes of consciousness
2. Will need to clarify relationship between logical and temporal aspects of development
3. Important to understand how this introduction relates to rest of Phenomenology

## Connections to Previous Materials
As first lecture, establishes foundational concepts and methodology.

[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE][PRE-LECTURE]

<thinking>
1. You're correct - according to the mode rules, we should prepare a handoff to philosophy-class-analysis mode once pre-lecture analysis is complete
2. We have completed:
   - Reading analysis
   - Questions document
   - Conceptual hypotheses 
   - Temporary conceptual map
   - Review of lecture transcripts
3. Will prepare handoff package and switch modes

<content># Pre-Lecture to Class Analysis Handoff

## Analysis Status
- Completed pre-lecture analysis of Phenomenology of Spirit Introduction
- Analyzed both lecture transcripts from January 7
- Established conceptual framework and key questions

## Key Insights
1. **Methodological Framework**
   - Investigation must be immanent to consciousness
   - Progression must be necessary, not contingent
   - Distinction between "for consciousness" and "for us"

2. **Central Concepts**
   - Experience as dialectical movement
   - Natural consciousness as starting point
   - Science as both goal and process
   - Determinate negation as mechanism of progress

3. **Critical Questions for Class Analysis**
   - How does consciousness undermine itself through its own criteria?
   - What makes each transition necessary rather than contingent?
   - How does dialectical movement relate to historical development?

## Materials Included
- Reading analysis: analysis_workspace/readings/pre_lecture/current.md
- Questions: analysis_workspace/questions/upcoming_lecture.md
- Conceptual development: analysis_workspace/hypotheses/conceptual_development.md
- Conceptual map: analysis_workspace/temporary_conceptual_map/index.md
- Chronological status: analysis_workspace/analysis_logs/chronological_index.md

## Next Steps for Class Analysis
1. Examine how lecture presentation handled key methodological issues
2. Track development of central concepts through lecture discussion
3. Compare pre-lecture hypotheses with actual lecture content
4. Integrate insights from class discussion with initial framework

## Notes for Integration
- Pay special attention to professor's emphasis on imminent development
- Note distinction between historical and logical progression
- Track how introduction's methodology plays out in concrete analysis</content>

<content># Class Analysis: January 7 Lecture - Introduction to PhS

## Lecture Overview
- Introduction to course structure and Hegel's system
- Analysis of PhS Introduction
- Discussion of methodology and key concepts

## Course Framework Insights
1. Teaching approach:
   - Focus on complete system rather than just Phenomenology
   - Balance between detailed reading and systematic overview
   - Emphasis on understanding rather than historical chronology

2. Course Structure:
   - First 2 weeks: Phenomenology
   - Weeks 3-6: Logic
   - Remaining weeks: Philosophy of Nature, Spirit, Right, Art, Religion

## Key Methodological Points
1. **Imminent Development**
   - Philosophy must develop from itself without presuppositions
   - Cannot rely on external standards or criteria
   - "We must purely look on" at consciousness's self-examination

2. **Science vs. Appearance**
   - Phenomenology both appears as science and is science
   - Distinction between what is "for consciousness" vs "for us"
   - Science comes on scene but must justify itself

3. **Experience (Erfahrung)**
   - Not empirical experience but dialectical movement
   - Consciousness undergoes necessary development
   - Each stage contains truth of previous one

## Conceptual Development

### Original Project vs Final Form
- Initially "Science of Experience of Consciousness"
- Expanded to "Phenomenology of Spirit"
- Shift indicates broader scope and deeper ambition

### Consciousness & Spirit
1. Natural Consciousness
   - Initial unreflective form
   - Has conception of knowledge and truth
   - Contains own criterion within itself

2. Development Toward Spirit
   - Movement through necessary stages
   - Each stage more adequate than last
   - Final unity of consciousness and object

### Truth & Knowledge
1. Traditional Problems
   - Instrument/medium problem
   - Subject-object division
   - Criterion dilemma

2. Hegelian Resolution
   - Truth as process not fixed state
   - Knowledge develops through necessary stages
   - Final unity overcomes traditional problems

## Key Clarifications
1. **Not Historical Development**
   - Logical/conceptual necessity not temporal
   - Historical examples illustrate but don't determine
   - System exists outside time

2. **Nature of Dialectic**
   - Self-undermining of consciousness
   - Determinate negation produces new content
   - Movement is necessary not contingent

3. **Role of Phenomenology**
   - Introduction to system
   - Science of spirit's appearance
   - Both path to and embodiment of science

## Questions Raised/Addressed
1. How does consciousness examine itself without presuppositions?
2. What makes transitions necessary rather than contingent?
3. How does phenomenology relate to complete system?

## Notable Quotes
"The journey is the destination" - capturing key insight that absolute knowing is process not endpoint

## Pedagogical Insights
- Importance of careful reading vs high-level summary
- Balance between accessibility and rigor
- Connection between method and content

## Next Steps
1. Track how these methodological principles play out in practice
2. Watch for development of key concepts
3. Pay attention to relationship between part and whole
4. Note how introduction's framework guides later analysis</content>

 1 | ## A. CONSCIOUSNESS
 2 | ### I. SENSE-CERTAINTY: OR THE ‘THIS’ AND ‘MEANING’ [MEINEN]
 3 | 90. The knowledge or knowing which is at the start or is immediately our object cannot be anything else but immediate knowledge itself, a knowledge of the immediate or of what simply is. Our approach to the object must also be immediate or receptive; we must alter nothing in the object as it presents itself. In apprehending it, we must refrain from trying to comprehend it.
 4 | 
 5 | 91. Because of its concrete content, sense-certainty immediately appears as the richest kind of knowledge, indeed a knowledge of infinite wealth for which no bounds can be found, either when we reach out into space and time in which it is dispersed, or when we take a bit of this wealth, and by division enter into it. Moreover, sense-certainty appears to be the truest knowledge; for it has not as yet omitted anything from the object, but has the object before it in its perfect entirety. But, in the event, this very certainty proves itself to be the most abstract and poorest truth. All that it says about what it knows is just that it is; and its truth contains nothing but the sheer being of the thing [Sache]. Consciousness, for its part, is in this certainty only as a pure ‘I’; or I am in it only as a pure ‘This’, and the object similarly only as a pure ‘This’. I, this particular I, am certain of this particular thing, not because I, qua consciousness, in knowing it have developed myself or thought about it in various ways; and also not because the thing of which I am certain, in virtue of a host of distinct qualities, would be in its own self a rich complex of connections, or related in various ways to other things. Neither of these has anything to do with the truth of sense-certainty: here neither I nor the thing has the significance of a complex process of mediation; the ‘I’ does not have the significance of a manifold imagining or thinking; nor does the ‘thing’ signify something that has a host of qualities. On the contrary, the thing is, and it is, merely because it is. It is; this is the essential point for sense-knowledge, and this pure being, or this simple immediacy, constitutes its truth. Similarly, certainty as a connection is an immediate pure connection: consciousness is ‘I’, nothing more, a pure ‘This’; the singular consciousness knows a pure ‘This’, or the single item.
 6 | 
 7 | 92. But when we look carefully at this pure being which constitutes the essence of this certainty, and which this certainty pronounces to be its truth, we see that much more is involved. An actual sense-certainty is not merely this pure immediacy, but an instance of it. Among the countless differences cropping up here we find in every case that the crucial one is that, in sense-certainty, pure being at once splits up into what we have called the two ‘Thises’, one ‘This’ as ‘I’, and the other ‘This’ as object. When we reflect on this difference, we find that neither one nor the other is only immediately present in sense-certainty, but each is at the same time mediated: I have this certainty through something else, viz. the thing; and it, similarly, is in sense-certainty through something else, viz. through the ‘I’.
 8 | 
 9 | 93. It is not just we who make this distinction between essence and instance, between immediacy and mediation; on the contrary, we find it within sense-certainty itself, and it is to be taken up in the form in which it is present there, not as we have just defined it. One of the terms is posited in sense-certainty in the form of a simple, immediate being, or as the essence, the object; the other, however, is posited as what is unessential and mediated, something which in sense-certainty is not in itself but through [the mediation of] an other, the ‘I’, a knowing which knows the object only because the object is, while the knowing may either be or not be. But the object is: it is what is true, or it is the essence. It is, regardless of whether it is known or not; and it remains, even if it is not known, whereas there is no knowledge if the object is not there.
10 | 
11 | 94. The question must therefore be considered whether in sense-certainty itself the object is in fact the kind of essence that sense-certainty proclaims it to be; whether this notion of it as the essence corresponds to the way it is present in sense-certainty. To this end, we have not to reflect on it and ponder what it might be in truth, but only to consider the way in which it is present in sense-certainty.
12 | 
13 | 95. It is, then, sense-certainty itself that must be asked: ‘What is the This?’ If we take the ‘This’ in the twofold shape of its being, as ‘Now’ and as ‘Here’, the dialectic it has in it will receive a form as intelligible as the ‘This’ itself is. To the question: ‘What is Now?’, let us answer, e.g. ‘Now is Night.’ In order to test the truth of this sense-certainty a simple experiment will suffice. We write down this truth; a truth cannot lose anything by being written down, any more than it can lose anything through our preserving it. If now, this noon, we look again at the written truth we shall have to say that it has become stale.
14 | 
15 | 96. The Now that is Night is preserved, i.e. it is treated as what it professes to be, as something that is; but it proves itself to be, on the contrary, something that is not. The Now does indeed preserve itself, but as something that is not Night; equally, it preserves itself in face of the Day that it now is, as something that also is not Day, in other words, as a negative in general. This self-preserving Now is, therefore, not immediate but mediated; for it is determined as a permanent and self-preserving Now through the fact that something else, viz. Day and Night, is not. As so determined, it is still just as simply Now as before, and in this simplicity is indifferent to what happens in it; just as little as Night and Day are its being, just as much also is it Day and Night; it is not in the least affected by this its other-being. A simple thing of this kind which is through negation, which is neither This nor That, a not-This, and is with equal indifference This as well as That—such a thing we call a universal. So it is in fact the universal that is the true [content] of sense-certainty.
16 | 
17 | 97. It is as a universal too that we utter what the sensuous [content] is. What we say is: ‘This’, i.e. the universal This; or, ‘it is’, i.e. Being in general. Of course, we do not envisage the universal This or Being in general, but we utter the universal; in other words, we do not strictly say what in this sense-certainty we mean to say. But language, as we see, is the more truthful; in it, we ourselves directly refute what we mean to say, and since the universal is the true [content] of sense-certainty and language expresses this true [content] alone, it is just not possible for us ever to say, or express in words, a sensuous being that we mean.
18 | 
19 | 98. The same will be the case with the other form of the ‘This’, with ‘Here’. ‘Here’ is, e.g., the tree. If I turn round, this truth has vanished and is converted into its opposite: ‘No tree is here, but a house instead’. ‘Here’ itself does not vanish; on the contrary, it abides constant in the vanishing of the house, the tree, etc., and is indifferently house or tree. Again, therefore, the ‘This’ shows itself to be a mediated simplicity, or a universality.
20 | 
21 | 99. Pure being remains, therefore, as the essence of this sense-certainty, since sense-certainty has demonstrated in its own self that the truth of its object is the universal. But this pure being is not an immediacy, but something to which negation and mediation are essential; consequently, it is not what we mean by ‘being’, but is ‘being’ defined as an abstraction, or as the pure universal; and our ‘meaning’, for which the true [content] of sense-certainty is not the universal, is all that is left over in face of this empty or indifferent Now and Here.
22 | 
23 | 100. When we compare the relation in which knowing and the object first came on the scene, with the relation in which they now stand in this result, we find that it is reversed. The object, which was supposed to be the essential element in sense-certainty, is now the unessential element; for the universal which the object has come to be is no longer what the object was supposed essentially to be for sense-certainty. On the contrary, the certainty is now to be found in the opposite element, viz. in knowing, which previously was the unessential element. Its truth is in the object as my object, or in its being mine [Meinen]; it is, because I know it. Sense-certainty, then, though indeed expelled from the object, is not yet thereby overcome, but only driven back into the ‘I’. We have now to see what experience shows us about its reality in the ‘I’.
24 | 
25 | 101. The force of its truth thus lies now in the ‘I’, in the immediacy of my seeing, hearing, and so on; the vanishing of the single Now and Here that we mean is prevented by the fact that I hold them fast. ‘Now’ is day because I see it; ‘Here’ is a tree for the same reason. But in this relationship sense-certainty experiences the same dialectic acting upon itself as in the previous one. I, this ‘I’, see the tree and assert that ‘Here’ is a tree; but another ‘I’ sees the house and maintains that ‘Here’ is not a tree but a house instead. Both truths have the same authentication, viz. the immediacy of seeing, and the certainty and assurance that both have about their knowing; but the one truth vanishes in the other.
26 | 
27 | 102. What does not disappear in all this is the ‘I’ as universal, whose seeing is neither a seeing of the tree nor of this house, but is a simple seeing which, though mediated by the negation of this house, etc., is all the same simple and indifferent to whatever happens in it, to the house, the tree, etc. The ‘I’ is merely universal like ‘Now’, ‘Here’, or ‘This’ in general; I do indeed mean a single ‘I’, but I can no more say what I mean in the case of ‘I’ than I can in the case of ‘Now’ and ‘Here’. When I say ‘this Here’, ‘this Now’, or a ‘single item’, I am saying all Thises, Heres, Nows, all single items. Similarly, when I say ‘I’, this singular ‘I’, I say in general all ‘Is’; everyone is what I say, everyone is ‘I’, this singular ‘I’. When Science is faced with the demand—as if it were an acid test it could not pass—that it should deduce, construct, find a priori, or however it is put, something called ‘this thing’ or ‘this one man’, it is reasonable that the demand should say which ‘this thing’, or which ‘this particular man’ is meant; but it is impossible to say this.
28 | 
29 | 103. Sense-certainty thus comes to know by experience that its essence is neither in the object nor in the ‘I’, and that its immediacy is neither an immediacy of the one nor of the other; for in both, what I mean is rather something unessential, and the object and the ‘I’ are universals in which that ‘Now’ and ‘Here’ and ‘I’ which I mean do not have a continuing being, or are not. Thus we reach the stage where we have to posit the whole of sense-certainty itself as its essence, and no longer only one of its moments, as happened in the two cases where first the object confronting the ‘I’, and then the ‘I’, were supposed to be its reality. Thus it is only sense-certainty as a whole which stands firm within itself as immediacy and by so doing excludes from itself all the opposition which has hitherto obtained.
30 | 
31 | 104. This pure immediacy, therefore, no longer has any concern with the otherness of the ‘Here’, as a tree which passes over into a ‘Here’ that is not a tree, or with the otherness of the ‘Now’ as day which changes into a ‘Now’ that is night, or with another ‘I’ for which something else is object. Its truth preserves itself as a relation that remains self-identical, and which makes no distinction of what is essential and what is unessential, between the ‘I’ and the object, a relation therefore into which also no distinction whatever can penetrate. I, this ‘I’, assert then the ‘Here’ as a tree, and do not turn round so that the Here would become for me not a tree; also, I take no notice of the fact that another ‘I’ sees the Here as not a tree, or that I myself at another time take the Here as not-tree, the Now as not-day. On the contrary, I am a pure [act of] intuiting; I, for my part, stick to the fact that the Now is day, or that the Here is a tree; also I do not compare Here and Now themselves with one another, but stick firmly to one immediate relation: the Now is day.
32 | 
33 | 105. Since, then, this certainty will no longer come forth to us when we direct its attention to a Now that is night, or to an ‘I’ to whom it is night, we will approach it and let ourselves point to the Now that is asserted. We must let ourselves point to it; for the truth of this immediate relation is the truth of this ‘I’ which confines itself to one ‘Now’ or one ‘Here’. Were we to examine this truth afterwards, or stand at a distance from it, it would lose its significance entirely; for that would do away with the immediacy which is essential to it. We must therefore enter the same point of time or space, point them out to ourselves, i.e. make ourselves into the same singular ‘I’ which is the one who knows with certainty. Let us, then, see how that immediate is constituted that is pointed out to us.
34 | 
35 | 106. The Now is pointed to, this Now. ‘Now’; it has already ceased to be in the act of pointing to it. The Now that is, is another Now than the one pointed to, and we see that the Now is just this: to be no more just when it is. The Now, as it is pointed out to us, is Now that has been, and this is its truth; it has not the truth of being. Yet this much is true, that it has been. But what essentially has been [gewesen ist] is, in fact, not an essence that is [kein Wesen]; it is not, and it was with being that we were concerned.
36 | 
37 | 107. In this pointing-out, then, we see merely a movement which takes the following course: (1) I point out the ‘Now’, and it is asserted to be the truth. I point it out, however, as something that has been, or as something that has been superseded; I set aside the first truth. (2) I now assert as the second truth that it has been, that it is superseded. (3) But what has been, is not; I set aside the second truth, its having been, its supersession, and thereby negate the negation of the ‘Now’, and thus return to the first assertion, that the ‘Now’ is. The ‘Now’, and pointing out the ‘Now’, are thus so constituted that neither the one nor the other is something immediate and simple, but a movement which contains various moments. A This is posited; but it is rather an other that is posited, or the This is superseded: and this otherness, or the setting-aside of the first, is itself in turn set aside, and so has returned into the first. However, this first, thus reflected into itself, is not exactly the same as it was to begin with, viz. something immediate; on the contrary, it is something that is reflected into itself, or a simple entity which, in its otherness, remains what it is: a Now which is an absolute plurality of Nows. And this is the true, the genuine Now, the Now as a simple day which contains within it many Nows—hours. A Now of this sort, an hour, similarly is many minutes, and this Now is likewise many Nows, and so on. The pointing-out of the Now is thus itself the movement which expresses what the Now is in truth, viz. a result, or a plurality of Nows all taken together; and the pointing-out is the experience of learning that Now is a universal.
38 | 
39 | 108. The Here pointed out, to which I hold fast, is similarly a this Here which, in fact, is not this Here, but a Before and Behind, an Above and Below, a Right and Left. The Above is itself similarly this manifold otherness of above, below, etc. The Here, which was supposed to have been pointed out, vanishes in other Heres, but these likewise vanish. What is pointed out, held fast, and abides, is a negative This, which is negative only when the Heres are taken as they should be, but, in being so taken, they supersede themselves; what abides is a simple complex of many Heres. The Here that is meant would be the point; but it is not: on the contrary, when it is pointed out as something that is, the pointing-out shows itself to be not an immediate knowing [of the point], but a movement from the Here that is meant through many Heres into the universal Here which is a simple plurality of Heres, just as the day is a simple plurality of Nows.
40 | 
41 | 109. It is clear that the dialectic of sense-certainty is nothing else but the simple history of its movement or of its experience, and sense-certainty itself is nothing else but just this history. That is why the natural consciousness, too, is always reaching this result, learning from experience what is true in it; but equally it is always forgetting it and starting the movement all over again. It is therefore astonishing when, in face of this experience, it is asserted as universal experience and put forward, too, as a philosophical proposition, even as the outcome of Scepticism, that the reality or being of external things taken as Thises or sense-objects has absolute truth for consciousness. To make such an assertion is not to know what one is saying, to be unaware that one is saying the opposite of what one wants to say. The truth for consciousness of a This of sense is supposed to be universal experience; but the very opposite is universal experience. Every consciousness itself supersedes such a truth, as e.g. Here is a tree, or, Now is noon, and proclaims the opposite: Here is not a tree, but a house; and similarly, it immediately again supersedes the assertion which set aside the first so far as it is also just such an assertion of a sensuous This. And what consciousness will learn from experience in all sense-certainty is, in truth, only what we have seen viz. the This as a universal, the very opposite of what that assertion affirmed to be universal experience.
42 | 
43 | With this appeal to universal experience we may be permitted to anticipate how the case stands in the practical sphere. In this respect we can tell those who assert the truth and certainty of the reality of sense-objects that they should go back to the most elementary school of wisdom, viz. the ancient Eleusinian Mysteries of Ceres and Bacchus, and that they have still to learn the secret meaning of the eating of bread and the drinking of wine. For he who is initiated into these Mysteries not only comes to doubt the being of sensuous things, but to despair of it; in part he brings about the nothingness of such things himself in his dealings with them, and in part he sees them reduce themselves to nothingness. Even the animals are not shut out from this wisdom but, on the contrary, show themselves to be most profoundly initiated into it; for they do not just stand idly in front of sensuous things as if these possessed intrinsic being, but, despairing of their reality, and completely assured of their nothingness, they fall to without ceremony and eat them up. And all Nature, like the animals, celebrates these open Mysteries which teach the truth about sensuous things.
44 | 
45 | 110. But, just as our previous remarks would suggest, those who put forward such an assertion also themselves say the direct opposite of what they mean: a phenomenon which is perhaps best calculated to induce them to reflect on the nature of sense-certainty. They speak of the existence of external objects, which can be more precisely defined as actual, absolutely singular, wholly personal, individual things, each of them absolutely unlike anything else; this existence, they say, has absolute certainty and truth. They mean ‘this’ bit of paper on which I am writing—or rather have written—‘this’; but what they mean is not what they say. If they actually wanted to say ‘this’ bit of paper which they mean, if they wanted to say it, then this is impossible, because the sensuous This that is meant cannot be reached by language, which belongs to consciousness, i.e. to that which is inherently universal. In the actual attempt to say it, it would therefore crumble away; those who started to describe it would not be able to complete the description, but would be compelled to leave it to others, who would themselves finally have to admit to speaking about something which is not. They certainly mean, then, this bit of paper here which is quite different from the bit mentioned above; but they say ‘actual things’, ‘external or sensuous objects’, ‘absolutely singular entities’ [Wesen] and so on; i.e. they say of them only what is universal. Consequently, what is called the unutterable is nothing else than the untrue, the irrational, what is merely meant [ but is not actually expressed].
46 | 
47 | If nothing more is said of something than that it is ‘an actual thing’, an ‘external object’, its description is only the most abstract of generalities and in fact expresses its sameness with everything rather than its distinctiveness. When I say: ‘a single thing’, I am really saying what it is from a wholly universal point of view, for everything is a single thing; and likewise ‘this thing’ is anything you like. If we describe it more exactly as ‘this bit of paper’, then each and every bit of paper is ‘this bit of paper’, and I have only uttered the universal all the time. But if I want to help out language—which has the divine nature of directly reversing the meaning of what is said, of making it into something else, and thus not letting what is meant get into words at all—by pointing out this bit of paper, experience teaches me what the truth of sense-certainty in fact is: I point it out as a ‘Here’, which is a Here of other Heres, or is in its own self a ‘simple togetherness of many Heres’; i.e. it is a universal. I take it up then as it is in truth, and instead of knowing something immediate I take the truth of it, or perceive it.8

<content># Pre-Lecture Reading: Phenomenology of Spirit - Sense-Certainty

## Basic Information
- **Author**: G.W.F. Hegel
- **Date/Period**: 1807
- **Assigned For**: January 14, 2025
- **Pages/Sections**: §90-110
- **Part**: A. Consciousness, I. Sense-Certainty

## Initial Engagement
First shape of consciousness in the Phenomenology, examining the most immediate form of knowledge - sensuous certainty. The text analyzes how this seemingly richest and truest form of knowledge proves to be the most abstract and poorest truth.

## Key Passages
```
The knowledge or knowing which is at the start or is immediately our object cannot be anything else but immediate knowledge itself, a knowledge of the immediate or of what simply is.
```
**Significance**: Establishes starting point of phenomenological investigation with most basic form of knowledge.

```
Because of its concrete content, sense-certainty immediately appears as the richest kind of knowledge... But, in the event, this very certainty proves itself to be the most abstract and poorest truth.
```
**Significance**: Sets up key dialectical movement from apparent richness to demonstrated poverty.

## Central Concepts
1. **Sense-Certainty**
   - Immediate knowledge
   - Knowledge of "what simply is"
   - Seems richest but proves poorest

2. **The 'This'**
   - Now and Here
   - Immediate particulars
   - Universal through negation

3. **Mediation**
   - Emerges in seemingly immediate
   - Through I and object relation
   - Essential to knowledge

## Potential Arguments
1. Sense-certainty's self-undermining through:
   - Now becoming then
   - Here becoming there
   - This becoming that

2. Language reveals universality:
   - Cannot say the particular
   - Only express the universal
   - Truth of sense-certainty

3. Development toward perception:
   - Through failure of immediacy
   - Necessity of mediation
   - Movement to universal

## Historical Context
First concrete shape of consciousness following Introduction's methodological framework. Shows how method works in practice through analysis of most basic form of knowledge.

## Difficult Sections
```
The Now that is Night is preserved... This self-preserving Now is, therefore, not immediate but mediated; for it is determined as a permanent and self-preserving Now through the fact that something else, viz. Day and Night, is not.
```
**Difficulty**: Complex movement from immediate to mediated
**Potential Interpretation**: Shows how apparent immediacy contains implicit mediation through relation to what it is not

## Questions for Lecture
1. How does this shape exemplify method from Introduction?
2. What makes transition to Perception necessary?
3. What role does language play in revealing truth?
4. How does the dialectic of Now/Here work?

## Hypotheses about Lecture Content
1. Will demonstrate concrete application of phenomenological method
2. Focus on dialectical movement from immediate to mediated
3. Show necessity of movement to perception
4. Connect to broader themes of consciousness's development

## Connections to Previous Materials
1. Methodology from Introduction now applied
2. First example of:
   - Dialectical movement
   - Determinate negation
   - Necessary development

## Personal Reflections
The text demonstrates remarkable philosophical depth in analyzing what seems most simple and obvious. Shows how phenomenological method reveals complexity in apparent simplicity.</content>

<content># Conceptual Development Hypotheses - Sense-Certainty

## Methodological Application

### Framework from Introduction
1. **Immanent Development**
   - How consciousness examines itself
   - Standards internal to sense-certainty
   - Self-undermining through own criteria

2. **For Us vs For Consciousness**
   - What appears to sense-certainty
   - What we observe in its development
   - Relationship between perspectives

3. **Necessary Progression**
   - Why movement to Perception necessary
   - How dialectic generates new shape
   - Role of determinate negation

## Key Concepts

### This/Here/Now

<content># Temporary Conceptual Map - Sense-Certainty

## Core Structure

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Sense-Certainty] -->|appears as| B[Richest Knowledge]
    A -->|proves to be| C[Poorest Truth]
    A -->|examines| D[This/Here/Now]
    D -->|reveals| E[Universal]
    F[Immediate] -->|becomes| G[Mediated]
    H[Particular] -->|transforms into| I[Universal]
```

## Key Relationships

### Methodological Framework
1. **Consciousness-Object**
   - Initial immediate relation
   - Internal mediation
   - Dialectical development

2. **For Us-For Consciousness**
   - What appears
   - What develops
   - Scientific observation

3. **Truth-Development**
   - Through experience
   - Via negation
   - Toward perception

## Movement Structure

### First Movement: This
1. Initial Stage
   - Immediate certainty
   - Direct relation
   - Pure being

2. Dialectical Process
   - Here/Now analysis
   - Temporal/spatial change
   - Universal emergence

3. Result
   - Mediated knowledge
   - Universal character
   - Negation of immediacy

### Second Movement: I
1. Starting Point
   - Subject certainty
   - Individual knowing
   - Pure immediacy

2. Development
   - Multiple subjects
   - Various perspectives
   - Universal I

3. Outcome
   - Mediated subjectivity
   - Universal knowing
   - New problems

### Third Movement: Unity
1. Initial Unity
   - Whole of sense-certainty
   - Immediate relation
   - Simple truth

2. Process
   - Internal examination
   - Self-undermining
   - Necessary development

3. Resolution
   - Transition to perception
   - New shape emerging
   - Higher unity

## Conceptual Transformations

### Immediacy to Mediation
- Through internal development
- Via necessary moments
- Toward systematic structure

### Particular to Universal
- Through language
- Via negation
- Toward truth

### Simple to Complex
- Through experience
- Via dialectic
- Toward richer knowledge

## Key Points for Lecture

### Methodological
1. Application of Introduction
   - Immanent development
   - Necessary progression
   - Scientific observation

2. Dialectical Movement
   - Internal critique
   - Determinate negation
   - Systematic advance

3. Language Role
   - Universal expression
   - Truth revelation
   - Mediation demonstration

### Conceptual
1. Knowledge Development
   - From immediate to mediate
   - From particular to universal
   - From simple to complex

2. Truth Process
   - Through experience
   - Via negation
   - Toward system

3. Consciousness Structure
   - Subject-object relation
   - Internal development
   - Systematic progression

## Integration Points

### With Previous Work
- Method application
- Systematic development
- Truth emergence

### With Future Development
- Perception preparation
- System building
- Knowledge enrichment</content>

<content># Class Analysis to Pre-Lecture Handoff

## Completed Analysis
- January 7 lecture analysis complete
- Concept development tracked
- Integration with pre-lecture materials documented
- Secondary literature questions recorded

## Key Outcomes
1. **Methodological Framework**
   - Importance of immanent development
   - Role of for-us vs for-consciousness distinction
   - Nature of dialectical movement

2. **Conceptual Development**
   - Experience as dialectical process
   - Natural consciousness to scientific knowing
   - Truth through necessary stages

3. **Integration Points**
   - Connection of method to content
   - Relationship of parts to whole
   - System development

## Recommendations for Pre-Lecture Analysis
1. Focus on application of established methodology
2. Track how Introduction's framework applies to first shape
3. Note connections between general method and specific content

## Reason for Mode Switch
Need to begin pre-lecture analysis of Sense-Certainty chapter following established methodological framework. January 7 analysis provides foundation for understanding how method applies to concrete shapes of consciousness.</content>

 2 | 
 3 | ## Analysis Status
 4 | - Completed pre-lecture analysis of Phenomenology of Spirit Introduction
 5 | - Analyzed both lecture transcripts from January 7
 6 | - Established conceptual framework and key questions
 7 | 
 8 | ## Key Insights
 9 | 1. **Methodological Framework**
10 |    - Investigation must be immanent to consciousness
11 |    - Progression must be necessary, not contingent
12 |    - Distinction between "for consciousness" and "for us"
13 | 
14 | 2. **Central Concepts**
15 |    - Experience as dialectical movement
16 |    - Natural consciousness as starting point
17 |    - Science as both goal and process
18 |    - Determinate negation as mechanism of progress
19 | 
20 | 3. **Critical Questions for Class Analysis**
21 |    - How does consciousness undermine itself through its own criteria?
22 |    - What makes each transition necessary rather than contingent?

 1 | # Class Analysis: January 7 Lecture - Introduction to PhS
 2 | 
 3 | ## Lecture Overview
 4 | - Introduction to course structure and Hegel's system
 5 | - Analysis of PhS Introduction
 6 | - Discussion of methodology and key concepts
 7 | 
 8 | ## Course Framework Insights
 9 | 1. Teaching approach:
10 |    - Focus on complete system rather than just Phenomenology
11 |    - Balance between detailed reading and systematic overview
12 |    - Emphasis on understanding rather than historical chronology
13 | 
14 | 2. Course Structure:
15 |    - First 2 weeks: Phenomenology
16 |    - Weeks 3-6: Logic
17 |    - Remaining weeks: Philosophy of Nature, Spirit, Right, Art, Religion
18 | 
19 | ## Key Methodological Points
20 | 1. **Imminent Development**
21 |    - Philosophy must develop from itself without presuppositions
22 |    - Cannot rely on external standards or criteria
23 |    - "We must purely look on" at consciousness's self-examination
24 | 
25 | 2. **Science vs. Appearance**
26 |    - Phenomenology both appears as science and is science
27 |    - Distinction between what is "for consciousness" vs "for us"
28 |    - Science comes on scene but must justify itself
29 | 
30 | 3. **Experience (Erfahrung)**
31 |    - Not empirical experience but dialectical movement
32 |    - Consciousness undergoes necessary development
33 |    - Each stage contains truth of previous one
34 | 
35 | ## Conceptual Development
36 | 
37 | ### Original Project vs Final Form
38 | - Initially "Science of Experience of Consciousness"
39 | - Expanded to "Phenomenology of Spirit"
40 | - Shift indicates broader scope and deeper ambition
41 | 
42 | ### Consciousness & Spirit
43 | 1. Natural Consciousness
44 |    - Initial unreflective form
45 |    - Has conception of knowledge and truth
46 |    - Contains own criterion within itself
47 | 
48 | 2. Development Toward Spirit
49 |    - Movement through necessary stages
50 |    - Each stage more adequate than last
51 |    - Final unity of consciousness and object
52 | 
53 | ### Truth & Knowledge
54 | 1. Traditional Problems
55 |    - Instrument/medium problem
56 |    - Subject-object division
57 |    - Criterion dilemma
58 | 
59 | 2. Hegelian Resolution
60 |    - Truth as process not fixed state
61 |    - Knowledge develops through necessary stages
62 |    - Final unity overcomes traditional problems
63 | 
64 | ## Key Clarifications
65 | 1. **Not Historical Development**
66 |    - Logical/conceptual necessity not temporal
67 |    - Historical examples illustrate but don't determine
68 |    - System exists outside time
69 | 
70 | 2. **Nature of Dialectic**
71 |    - Self-undermining of consciousness
72 |    - Determinate negation produces new content
73 |    - Movement is necessary not contingent
74 | 
75 | 3. **Role of Phenomenology**
76 |    - Introduction to system
77 |    - Science of spirit's appearance
78 |    - Both path to and embodiment of science
79 | 
80 | ## Questions Raised/Addressed
81 | 1. How does consciousness examine itself without presuppositions?
82 | 2. What makes transitions necessary rather than contingent?
83 | 3. How does phenomenology relate to complete system?
84 | 
85 | ## Notable Quotes
86 | "The journey is the destination" - capturing key insight that absolute knowing is process not endpoint
87 | 
88 | ## Pedagogical Insights
89 | - Importance of careful reading vs high-level summary
90 | - Balance between accessibility and rigor
91 | - Connection between method and content
92 | 
93 | ## Next Steps
94 | 1. Track how these methodological principles play out in practice
95 | 2. Watch for development of key concepts
96 | 3. Pay attention to relationship between part and whole
97 | 4. Note how introduction's framework guides later analysis

<content># Class Analysis to Pre-Lecture Handoff

## Completed Analysis Components
1. **Lecture Analysis**
   - Course structure and methodology established
   - Key concepts identified and analyzed
   - Pedagogical approach documented

2. **Concept Development**
   - Experience (Erfahrung) progression traced
   - Dialectical movement explained
   - Natural consciousness to scientific knowing mapped

3. **Integration Analysis**
   - Pre-lecture/lecture connections established
   - Methodological clarity achieved
   - Systematic context understood

## Key Outcomes
1. Methodological Framework
   - Immanent development principle
   - Necessity of progression
   - For-us vs for-consciousness distinction

2. Conceptual Understanding
   - Experience as dialectical movement
   - Truth as process
   - Science as both path and goal

3. Systematic Context
   - Relationship to complete system
   - Connection of parts to whole
   - Integration of form and content

## Transition Requirements
1. **Completed Materials**
   - Jan 7 lecture analysis
   - Concept development tracking
   - Integration analysis
   - Secondary literature questions

2. **Verification**
   - All analysis components reviewed
   - Content completeness confirmed
   - Systematic connections established

3. **Next Phase**
   - Pre-lecture analysis of Sense-Certainty
   - Application of established methodology
   - Connection to broader system

## Handoff Notes
1. **Methodological Application**
   - Use established framework for Sense-Certainty
   - Track dialectical development
   - Note systematic connections

2. **Conceptual Development**
   - Follow progression from immediate to mediated
   - Track emergence of universality
   - Note necessary transitions

3. **Integration Points**
   - Connect Introduction to first shape
   - Apply methodological insights
   - Maintain systematic perspective

## Mode Switch Justification
Ready to transition to pre-lecture analysis having completed comprehensive analysis of January 7 lecture with all context transfer files verified and completed.</content>
