## Major Argumentative Movements

### 1. From Object to Subject
- Initial focus on immediate object (§6.a-c)
- Transition through mediation (§6.d-e)
- Shift to intention and I (§7.a-b)
- Resolution in non-differentiation (§7.b)

### 2. From Immediacy to Mediation
- Pure immediacy examined (§6.a-c)
- Internal differences emerge (§6.d-e)
- Mediation revealed as essence (§7.a-b)
- Transformed through absolute knowing (§7.c)

### 3. From Hegel to Being-Question
- Initial methodological framework (§6.a)
- Development of absolvent knowing (§7.c)
- Historical interpretation (§7.d)
- Fundamental ontological concerns (§7.d)

## Key Developmental Threads

### 1. Methodological
- From pure observation to absolvent knowing
- From description to reconstruction
- From phenomenology to fundamental ontology

### 2. Conceptual
- From this to universal
- From intention to non-differentiation
- From logos to being-question

### 3. Historical
- From Hegel's phenomenology
- Through Western metaphysics
- To question of being

## Integration Points with Course
1. Connection to Sense-Certainty chapter
2. Relationship to Introduction's method
3. Transition to perception
4. Framework for understanding dialectic

## Next Steps
1. Compare with Pippin's interpretation
2. Connect to primary Hegel text
3. Integrate into course progression
4. Consider implications for later chapters
