## Concept Relationships
1. Intention → Non-Differentiation (through analysis of immediacy)
2. Absolvent Knowledge → Logos (through historical analysis)
3. Logos → Being-Question (through Heidegger's interpretation)
4. Non-Differentiation → Absolvent Knowledge (through experience)

## Key Transformations
1. From intention to original unity
2. From experience to absolvent knowledge
3. From logos to being-question
4. From Hegel to fundamental ontology

## Notes
- Section shows Heidegger's distinctive interpretation emerging
- Being-question becomes central to reading of Hegel
- Absolvent knowledge offers new way to understand dialectic
