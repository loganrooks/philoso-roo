Date Processed: March 6, 2025
Target Course Date: January 14, 2025

## Core Concepts Map

### 1. Immediacy
- **Definition**: The initial mode of knowing that takes its object as simply present
- **Development**:
  - First appears as pure receptivity (§6.a)
  - Revealed as containing mediation (§6.d)
  - Transformed through temporal analysis (§6.e)
- **Locations**: §6.a, §6.c, §6.d, §6.e
- **Cross-references**: Hegel PhS §90-91, Pippin Ch.2

### 2. Being (Pure Being)
- **Definition**: The truth that sense certainty expresses about its object
- **Development**:
  - Initial appearance as simple presence (§6.c)
  - Split into being-in-itself and being-for-it (§6.b)
  - Revealed as universal through mediation (§6.e)
- **Locations**: §6.b, §6.c, §6.e
- **Cross-references**: Hegel PhS §91-92

### 3. The This (das Diese)
- **Definition**: The immediate object of sense certainty
- **Development**:
  - First appears as pure particular (§6.a)
  - Revealed as example structure (§6.d)
  - Shows universal character (§6.e)
- **Locations**: §6.a, §6.d, §6.e
- **Cross-references**: Hegel PhS §95-97

### 4. Spirit
- **Definition**: The framework within which sensibility appears
- **Development**:
  - Introduced as methodological principle (§6.a)
  - Shows role in transforming sensibility (§6.c)
  - Revealed as true subject of experience (§6.e)
- **Locations**: §6.a, §6.c
- **Cross-references**: Pippin Ch.2

### 5. Mediation
- **Definition**: The process of self-differentiation within immediacy
- **Development**:
  - Emerges through analysis of this (§6.d)
  - Revealed in temporal structure (§6.e)
  - Shows necessity in knowledge (§6.b)
- **Locations**: §6.b, §6.d, §6.e
- **Cross-references**: Hegel PhS §92-93

## Concept Relationships
1. Immediacy → Mediation (through internal differentiation)
2. This → Universal (through exemplification)
3. Pure Being → Spirit (through phenomenological analysis)
4. Particular → Universal (through temporal structure)

## Key Transformations
1. From pure receptivity to mediated knowing
2. From particular this to universal structure
3. From immediate presence to temporal mediation
4. From sensibility to spiritual framework

## Notes
- The concept development shows consistent movement from immediate to mediated structures
- Spirit emerges as the fundamental framework for understanding all other concepts
- Temporal analysis proves crucial for revealing universal structures
