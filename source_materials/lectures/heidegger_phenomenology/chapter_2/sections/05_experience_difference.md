## Content
```
Critical analysis of how difference appears within sense certainty:

"We make the distinction between the essence and the example, between immediacy and mediation. But Hegel says explicitly: 'It is not just we who make this distinction ... rather, we find it within sense certainty itself.'"

Key development of the now:
"The now gets shown; this now. Now... In saying 'now,' it is already past. It belongs to the now no longer to exist even as it exists. Thus, the now is what has already been."

Crucial emergence of universality:
"The now is what is absolutely many nows—it is universal."
```

## Key Topics
1. The internal emergence of difference
2. Temporal structure of the now
3. Movement from immediacy to universality

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Usage | Significance |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Found distinction | How difference appears | Not externally imposed |
| Now structure | Temporal dialectic | Shows internal negation |
| Universality | Result of movement | Emerges from particular |

## Arguments
| Argument | Structure | Evaluation |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Internal difference | P1: Distinction appears in sense certainty<br>P2: Not imposed by observers<br>C: Mediation inherent in immediacy | Key methodological point |
| Now's self-negation | P1: Now is immediately present<br>P2: In saying "now" it becomes past<br>P3: This structure is constant<br>C: Now is universal through negation | Core dialectical movement |

## Important Passages
| Passage | Context | Significance |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| "It is not just we..." | Analysis of distinction | Shows phenomenological method |
| "The now gets shown..." | Analysis of temporal structure | Key dialectical moment |

## Cross-References
| Reference | Material | Connection |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| Hegel PhS §96-97 | Analysis of Now | Direct textual basis |
| Pippin Ch.2 | Role of negation | Alternative view of temporality |

## Notes
This section reveals how the dialectical structure emerges from within sense certainty's own experience, not from external philosophical reflection.
