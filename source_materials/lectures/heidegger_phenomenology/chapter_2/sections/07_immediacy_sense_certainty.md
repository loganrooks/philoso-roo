## Content
```
Critical analysis of undifferentiated immediacy:

"What is the outcome of the preceding discussion? The immediacy of sense certainty consists neither in the immediacy of the this nor in the immediacy of intending. Neither of these moments of sense certainty is exclusively and explicitly what is immediate: neither the object in itself nor intending for itself."

Key development:
"Object and intending together mean that sense certainty as a whole knowing does not admit into itself any opposition between object and modes of knowing... Sense certainty is totally immersed in immediacy and absorbs it completely into itself and itself into it."
```

## Key Topics
1. Unity prior to differentiation
2. Wholeness of sense certainty
3. Nature of pre-reflective experience

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Usage | Significance |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Non-differentiation | Original state | Shows starting point |
| Wholeness | Character of immediacy | Prior to subject-object split |
| Immersion | Mode of experience | Complete absorption in immediate |

## Arguments
| Argument | Structure | Evaluation |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Nature of original unity | P1: Neither object nor I is primary<br>P2: Both together in immediacy<br>C: Original non-differentiation | Shows true starting point |
| Structure of immersion | P1: No opposition admitted<br>P2: Complete absorption<br>C: True character of immediacy | Key phenomenological insight |

## Important Passages
| Passage | Context | Significance |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| "The immediacy of sense certainty..." | Summary statement | Shows true nature of immediacy |
| "Sense certainty is totally immersed..." | Analysis of immersion | Key methodological insight |

## Cross-References

| §6.a | Initial immediacy | Shows development |

## Notes
This section reveals the deeper structure of immediacy as prior to the distinctions analyzed in §6, showing how the dialectic must be understood from within this original unity.
