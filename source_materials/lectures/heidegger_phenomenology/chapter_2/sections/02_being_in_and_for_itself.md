## Content
```
Key development of the threefold structure of the object:
1. The object in itself (as immediate for consciousness)
2. The being-for-it of the in-itself
3. The being-for-us of what is being-for-itself

Critical passage: "The object for us, who know the science, is always a knowledge. In this objectified knowledge lies knowledge's own relation to its known: the object for it. However, for it, for immediate knowledge, the object is at first and immediately not yet for it, but is in itself."
```

## Key Topics
1. Triple structure of the object in phenomenology
2. Relationship between absolute and immediate knowledge
3. Role of scientific observers ("us")

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Usage | Significance |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| In-itself | Initial moment of object | How object appears to immediate consciousness |
| For-it | Second moment | How object is for consciousness |
| For-us | Third moment | Scientific perspective on whole relation |

## Arguments
| Argument | Structure | Evaluation |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Necessity of threefold structure | P1: Object appears immediately<br>P2: This appearance is for consciousness<br>P3: This whole relation is for us<br>C: Three essential moments required | Foundational for phenomenological method |
| Role of absolute knowing | P1: We observe from scientific standpoint<br>P2: We see both object and relation to consciousness<br>C: Absolute perspective necessary for phenomenology | Key methodological insight |

## Important Passages
| Passage | Context | Significance |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| "The object for us..." | Definition of phenomenological observation | Establishes scientific viewpoint |
| "For it, for immediate knowledge..." | Analysis of immediate consciousness | Shows limitation of immediacy |
