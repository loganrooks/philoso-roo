Critical development of the this and exemplification:

"Pure being, the true immediacy, is therefore a sense certainty which in each case exemplifies. The 'I' too is in each case exemplified just as the this, which has the character of being a this [das Diesige]."

Key argument about differentiation:
"Both are differentiated, and both constitute a difference which has to be addressed as a 'principal difference.' As long as we are guided by what has fallen out of pure being, we do not have the immediate in its immediacy."
```

## Key Topics
1. The structure of exemplification
2. Emergence of differentiation in immediacy
3. The "principal difference" between I and this

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Usage | Significance |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Exemplification | Structure of sense certainty | Shows how universality emerges |
| Principal difference | Differentiation in immediacy | Key dialectical moment |
| Pure being | What breaks apart | Source of mediation |

## Arguments
| Argument | Structure | Evaluation |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Necessity of exemplification | P1: Each this is an example<br>P2: Examples show universal structure<br>C: Immediacy necessarily exemplifies | Shows internal mediation |
| Emergence of difference | P1: Pure being splits into I and this<br>P2: Split is "principal"<br>C: Mediation inherent in immediacy | Core dialectical movement |

## Important Passages
| Passage | Context | Significance |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| "Pure being, the true immediacy..." | Analysis of exemplification | Shows universality in particularity |
| "Both are differentiated..." | Discussion of principal difference | Key dialectical moment |

## Cross-References
| Reference | Material | Connection |

## Notes
Heidegger's emphasis on exemplification provides crucial insight into how universality emerges from particularity in sense certainty's development.
