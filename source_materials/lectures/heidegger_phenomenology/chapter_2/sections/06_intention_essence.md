## Content
```
Critical analysis of intention's role:

"Sense certainty, then, though indeed expelled from the object, is not yet thereby sublated, but only driven back into the I. We now have to see what experience shows us about this (its) reality."

Key development:
"The force of its truth thus lies now in the 'I,' in the immediacy of my seeing, hearing, and so on... Since in seeing and hearing, each I 'intends' and takes into its own only what it has seen, each I comports itself quite immediately, without letting itself be disturbed by anything other than what is seen."
```

## Key Topics
1. Shift from object to I
2. Role of intention in immediacy
3. Structure of intending consciousness

## Key Concepts
| Concept | Usage | Significance |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Intention | Mode of immediate consciousness | New center of analysis |
| I | Subject of intention | Shift from object focus |
| Immediacy | Now in subject rather than object | Transformation of problem |

## Arguments
| Argument | Structure | Evaluation |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| Necessity of shift to I | P1: Object proves mediated<br>P2: Truth moves to intending<br>C: Must examine I's role | Key dialectical movement |
| Structure of intention | P1: Each I intends immediately<br>P2: Takes only what it sees<br>C: New form of immediacy in subject | Shows transformation of problem |

## Important Passages
| Passage | Context | Significance |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| "Sense certainty, then..." | Transition to new phase | Shows dialectical movement |
| "The force of its truth..." | Analysis of intention | Key methodological shift |
