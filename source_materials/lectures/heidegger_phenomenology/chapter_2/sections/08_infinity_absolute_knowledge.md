Critical development of infinity and absolvent knowledge:

"Thus, if we said, over against a sense certainty that was earlier shown to us, that 'the now is not day but night,' then sense certainty would not get involved at all with this question, provided that sense certainty is really taken as what is immediate..."

Key methodological insight:
"To undergo an experience means to look at and follow what remains in the presence of the grinding away of the absolvent. Here, then, one must initially inquire whether in truth the reality of sense certainty is the 'intention' and not the 'this.'"
