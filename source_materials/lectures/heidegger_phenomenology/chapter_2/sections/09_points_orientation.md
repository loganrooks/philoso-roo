Critical development of the being-question:

"Our confrontation with Hegel arrives at this crossing which is located between finitude and infinity, as crossroads, which is not the same as the opposition of two points of view."

Key methodological insight:
"For Hegel, as the completion of Western metaphysics, the entire dimension of the problem of being is oriented toward the λόγος. But for Hegel λέγειν is not the simple proposition or one-sided general statement 'S is P.' Rather, λέγειν has already become διαλέγεσθαι."
