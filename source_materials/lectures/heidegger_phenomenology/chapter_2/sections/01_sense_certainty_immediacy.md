a) Immediate knowledge as the first necessary object for us who know absolutely
[The opening discussion establishing the methodological framework]

Hegel begins by saying: "The knowledge which is at first or is immediately our object cannot be anything else but immediate knowledge itself, a knowledge of the immediate or of a being. Our approach to the object must also be immediate or receptive; we must alter nothing in the object as it presents itself. In apprehending it, we must refrain from trying to comprehend it."
