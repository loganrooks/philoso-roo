Critical analysis of "pure being" and presence:

"What along with Hegel we call sense certainty appears as a cognition. We are not told further what this cognition is, but what is understood thereby is the way in which something becomes manifest according to some specific point of view as to what it is and how it is."

Key development: Hegel's interpretation of sensibility entirely in terms of spirit:
"What is unprecedented about Hegel's interpretation of sensibility is that he understands it entirely in terms of spirit and in spirit—as shown in the very posing of the problem. It is in spirit and for spirit that sensibility appears."
