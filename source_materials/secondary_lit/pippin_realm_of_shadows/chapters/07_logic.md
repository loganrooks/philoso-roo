## Section Information

## Key Claims

### 1. Nature of Hegelian Logic
- **Distinction**: Not formal or symbolic logic
- **Focus**: Rendering intelligible
- **Scope**: Conditions of determinacy
- **Method**: Self-development of thought

### 2. Relationship to Traditional Logic
1. **Term Logic**:
   - Not traditional subject-predicate form
   - Transformed understanding of judgment
   - New conception of conceptual content

2. **Beyond Formal Logic**:
   - Not mere rules of inference
   - Not truth-functional relations
   - Focused on conceptual necessity

### 3. Transformation of Kantian Logic
- **General Logic**: Reconceived as inherently content-related
- **Transcendental Logic**: Expanded beyond finite subjectivity
- **Unity**: Integration of general and transcendental logic

## Key Arguments

### 1. Against Traditional Understanding
1. **Rejection of Formalism**:
   - Not calculable operations
   - Not symbolic manipulation
   - Not content-indifferent

2. **New Understanding of Judgment**:
   - Activity rather than form
   - Self-conscious determination
   - Unity of form and content

### 2. Beyond Kant
1. **Content Generation**:
   - Self-determination of thought
   - No need for pure intuition
   - Internal development

2. **Objective Validity**:
   - Not restricted to appearances
   - Universal conditions
   - Inherent necessity

## Core Concepts

### Logical Content
- **Nature**: Self-determining
- **Source**: Pure thinking
- **Development**: Through negation
- **Structure**: Systematic unity

### Judgment
- **Role**: Basic unit of intelligibility
- **Nature**: Active determination
- **Structure**: Self-conscious
- **Function**: Truth-bearing

### Logical Necessity
- **Type**: Not formal
- **Source**: Conceptual development
- **Scope**: Universal conditions
- **Ground**: Self-determination

## Important Quotations

> "The concept is not intuited by the senses, is not represented in imagination; it is only subject matter, the product and content of thought."

> "What has been called objective logic here would correspond in part to what for him [Kant] is transcendental logic."
