Pick ONE of the two following questions to address in your essay.

Question 1: Explain Hegel’s reasons for thinking that the shape of consciousness he calls ‘Sensuous Certainty’ is inadequate and evaluate those reasons. Can Sensuous Certainty survive Hegel’s critique?

In the course of answering this primary question, your essay should address the following issues, but in continuous prose (not in numbered sections):

1. Explain what a ‘shape of consciousness’ is and Hegel’s method (in the Introduction) for showing that an individual such shape is inadequate. (Don’t feel you need to address the larger method of the PhS, e.g. constructing a complete terminating sequence of such shapes.). What does ‘inadequate’ mean here? What does this method show, if successful? What is Hegel entitled to assume in his argument with Sensuous Certainty? What is he not entitled to assume?

2. Explain what Sensuous Certainty is, as a shape of consciousness.

3. Identify what you think is Hegel’s most fundamental reason for thinking Sensuous Certainty is inadequate (according to your account of what the adequacy and inadequacy of such shapes amounts to). You do not need to go through every single ‘movement’ within Sensuous Certainty (but you should think about them).

4. Does the Hegelian criticism of Sensuous Certainty you identified as part of 3 meet the standards of Hegel’s method you identified in 1?

5. Could Sensuous Certainty effectively respond to these criticisms? Would those responses require it to become something different (to become a different shape)? Why or why not? Could Hegel counter those responses, compatible with his method (as you identified it in 1)?

6. Quote and appropriately cite Hegel’s text throughout to support your interpretation. (Cite the Phenomenology by paragraph number and by page number in the Pinkard translation provided on Quercus.)

Question 2: Explain Hegel’s reasons for claiming in the Science of Logic both that Being is Nothing and that Being is not Nothing.

In the course of answering this primary question, your essay should address the following issues, but in continuous prose (not in numbered sections):

1. Situate your answer within an account of Hegel’s project in the Science of Logic and what ‘rules’ it obeys, i.e., what Hegel is entitled to assume, and why he is not entitled to assume.

2. Is Hegel entitled to start the Logic with Being? Why? Make sure you answer to 1 coheres with your answer to 1.

3. What are we talking about when we talk about ‘Being’ and ‘Nothing’? Concepts, representations, entities, words, etc.? Make sure your answer coheres with your answer to 1.

4. Explain what Being is, and what Nothing is. (Again, this should cohere with your answer to 2)

5. How does Hegel ‘get from’ Being to Nothing? Does it cohere with the ‘rules’ of the Logic you specified in 1?

6. Why is Being Nothing? Why is Being not Nothing? Does Hegel have convincing reasons for making both claims? Why or why not?

7. You should consider and address at least briefly what role this contradiction (Being is Nothing and Being is not Nothing) plays in the larger project of the Science of Logic (from 1).

8. Quote and appropriately cite Hegel’s text throughout to support your interpretation. (Cite the Science of Logic by page number in the di Giovanni translation provided on Quercus.)

Note about style:

Your essay should be written so it can be understood by a mildly (but not brilliantly) intelligent person who knows nothing about Hegel and should make the philosophical issues apparent to that person.
For that reason, you should not write in ‘Hegel-ese’! On the other hand, you need to relate your interpretation to Hegel’s own puzzling language (6). So you must find some way to balance fidelity to Hegel’s text with explaining his ideas in less foreign terminology. This is the agony (and the ecstasy) of writing about Hegel. Enjoy.
Your essay should be 5–7 pages in length; it is due on Sunday Feb. 23 at 11:59 pm. You must submit an electronic version through Quercus as well as a printed-out hard copy to me in person (e.g. in class) or to my mailbox in the Philosophy Department (Jackman Humanities Building, 4th floor). (You can take a few extra days to get me the printed version; although the sooner everyone hands theirs in, the sooner everyone gets their marks.) Your essay should not include your name in the body of the text, but only your student number, so that I can mark them anonymously.
