      1. For lecture analysis, verify:

         - Each major concept includes direct quote via extraction marker
         - Each argument includes quoted premises/conclusion
         - Complex interpretations note confidence level
         - Alternative readings are documented where appropriate
         - Key philosophical terms have both positive and negative determinations
         - Potentially ambiguous terms are explicitly disambiguated
         - Verify analyses is extensive, detailed, substantive, well-supported and coherent
