I have decided to choose Question 2.

Question 2: Explain Hegel’s reasons for claiming in the Science of Logic both that Being is Nothing and that Being is not Nothing.

In the course of answering this primary question, your essay should address the following issues, but in continuous prose (not in numbered sections):

1. Situate your answer within an account of Hegel’s project in the Science of Logic and what ‘rules’ it obeys, i.e., what Hegel is entitled to assume, and why he is not entitled to assume.

2. Is Hegel entitled to start the Logic with Being? Why? Make sure you answer to 1 coheres with your answer to 1.

3. What are we talking about when we talk about ‘Being’ and ‘Nothing’? Concepts, representations, entities, words, etc.? Make sure your answer coheres with your answer to 1.

4. Explain what Being is, and what Nothing is. (Again, this should cohere with your answer to 2)

5. How does Hegel ‘get from’ Being to Nothing? Does it cohere with the ‘rules’ of the Logic you specified in 1?

6. Why is Being Nothing? Why is Being not Nothing? Does Hegel have convincing reasons for making both claims? Why or why not?

7. You should consider and address at least briefly what role this contradiction (Being is Nothing and Being is not Nothing) plays in the larger project of the Science of Logic (from 1).

8. Quote and appropriately cite Hegel’s text throughout to support your interpretation. (Cite the Science of Logic by page number in the di Giovanni translation provided on Quercus.)

Note about style:

Your essay should be written so it can be understood by a mildly (but not brilliantly) intelligent person who knows nothing about Hegel and should make the philosophical issues apparent to that person.
For that reason, you should not write in ‘Hegel-ese’! On the other hand, you need to relate your interpretation to Hegel’s own puzzling language (6). So you must find some way to balance fidelity to Hegel’s text with explaining his ideas in less foreign terminology. This is the agony (and the ecstasy) of writing about Hegel. Enjoy.
Your essay should be 5–7 pages in length; it is due on Sunday Feb. 23 at 11:59 pm. You must submit an electronic version through Quercus as well as a printed-out hard copy to me in person (e.g. in class) or to my mailbox in the Philosophy Department (Jackman Humanities Building, 4th floor). (You can take a few extra days to get me the printed version; although the sooner everyone hands theirs in, the sooner everyone gets their marks.) Your essay should not include your name in the body of the text, but only your student number, so that I can mark them anonymously.
