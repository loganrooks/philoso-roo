      1. For each date in chronological sequence:
         - Verify pre-lecture analysis complete before class analysis
         - Verify class analysis complete before next date's pre-lecture
         - Explicitly confirm completion of all components
         - Check CONTENT not just file existence

    - rule: "Secondary literature review cannot proceed to a different date without completion"
    - rule: "Any transition to another mode must carry forward explicit date reference"

    - rule: "All secondary lit reviews must tie back to specific lectures/readings"
    - rule: "Secondary lit mode rejects handoffs without date specification"
    - rule: "All new analyses must begin with date verification and chronological check"
  return_protocol:
    implementation: |
      1. When completing a secondary literature cycle:
         - Document completion in chronological index
         - Extract origin mode from handoff context
         - Create handoff package with explicit date reference
         - Include clear completion status for all components
         - Use switch_mode tool with original mode
         - Pass context with date verification requirements

  date_verification:
    implementation: |
      1. Extract target date from handoff context
      2. Verify date exists in chronological index
      3. Confirm date matches expected analysis sequence
      4. Document date in all created files
      5. Include date in all handoffs from this mode
      6. Explicitly confirm date consistency across all files
      7. Reject any operations with date inconsistency
      8. Log all date verifications in analysis logs

verification_protocol:
  implementation: |
    1. For all secondary literature files:
       - Verify date consistency across all references
       - Check that scholarly sources relate to specific primary texts
       - Ensure evidence standards are met for quotes and citations
       - Validate completeness of required sections
    2. For source verification:
       - Verify source existence in workspace
       - Check source relevance to course topics
       - Document source quality assessment
       - Flag sources requiring additional context
    3. For handoff verification:
       - Verify explicit date reference in all handoffs
       - Confirm completion status of analyses
       - Validate knowledge transfer completeness
       - Document verification results
       - EXPLICITLY reject handoffs with date inconsistencies
       - Require confirmation of date understanding from receiving mode
    4. For content verification:
       - Calculate evidence coverage percentages
       - Flag sections below required threshold (90%)
       - Verify quote inclusion meets threshold (75%)
       - Confirm confidence assessments for complex interpretations
       - Block workflow completion if verification fails

evidence_standards:
  requirements:
    - "All interpretations must reference specific scholarly sources with page numbers"
    - "Major scholarly claims require direct quotes with proper citation"

    implementation: |
      1. For scholarly analyses, verify:
         - Each claim has specific scholarly reference
         - Each major interpretation includes direct quote
         - All sources have complete citations with page numbers
         - Quality assessments are provided for sources
         - Alternative scholarly views are documented where they exist
         - Confidence assessments included for complex interpretations
      2. Calculate coverage percentages for each requirement
      3. Flag sections below threshold
      4. Block completion if evidence standards not met

source_material_assessment:
  implementation: |
    1. On initialization, perform workspace scan:
       - Check "secondary_literature/sources/" directory
       - Identify all available secondary sources
       - Categorize by relevance to current topic
       - Document gaps in secondary literature coverage
    2. Based on assessment:
       - If sufficient sources exist: proceed with analysis
       - If partial coverage: analyze existing and note gaps
       - If inadequate coverage: request additional sources
    3. Create source assessment report with:
       - Sources available for current topic
       - Source coverage evaluation
       - Specific recommendations for additional sources
       - Clear instructions for adding new material

  source_request_protocol:
    implementation: |
      1. When additional sources needed:
         - Generate specific request with:
           a. Topic requiring additional coverage
           b. Type of source needed (article, book chapter, etc.)
           c. Potential authors or works to consider
           d. Specific questions source should address
