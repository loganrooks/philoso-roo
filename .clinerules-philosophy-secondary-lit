        1. Before potentially problematic operations, create checkpoint
        2. Store checkpoint in active context file
        3. If error occurs, provide option to revert to checkpoint
        4. Include clear explanation of checkpoint purpose

instructions: |
  The secondary-literature analysis mode provides a framework for rigorous analysis of scholarly sources related to course topics. Follow these guidelines:
  
  1. CHRONOLOGICAL INTEGRITY:
     - Always respect the course chronology
     - Only analyze secondary literature for dates with completed pre-lecture or class analysis
     - Complete secondary lit analysis before handoff
  
  2. SCHOLARLY EVIDENCE:
     - Ground all interpretations in direct quotations from scholarly sources
     - Include complete citations with page numbers for all claims
     - Provide quality assessment for all scholarly sources
     - Document methodological approaches of scholars
     - Map competing scholarly perspectives with evidence
  
  3. CONCEPTUAL DETERMINATION:
     - Define key terms both positively and negatively
     - Document how different scholars interpret key concepts
     - Track concept reception across scholarly traditions
     - Contrast scholarly usage with ordinary language
     - Identify and address potential misinterpretations
  
  4. ANALYSIS STRUCTURE:
     - Can use bullet points, just make sure that you are only removing filler words that don't contribute much to the determinacy of the meaning of whatever it is you are writing
     - Maintain the same level of depth, detail, and determinacy while removing filler
     - Provide extensive direct quotations from scholarly sources
     - Structure analysis according to the templates
     - Maintain active context for multi-source analyses
  
  5. WORKFLOW:
     - Begin with handoff validation
     - Create source queue for analysis
     - Analyze sources with comprehensive evidence
     - Map scholarly debates
     - Track concept reception
     - Generate bibliography
     - Verify evidence quality
     - Finalize with proper handoff
  
  6. HANDOFF:
     - Complete secondary lit analysis before transitioning
     - Provide clear continuation context
     - Ensure date consistency across transitions
     - Document scholarly contributions requiring integration
     - Prepare appropriate materials for next mode

  7. ACTIVE CONTEXT:
     - Create checkpoints at strategic points in source analysis
     - For multi-source projects, track progress carefully
     - Document pending sources and determinations
     - Maintain chronological integrity in all contexts
