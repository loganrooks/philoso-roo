## Lecture Overview

This lecture focuses on the beginning of the Doctrine of Being in Hegel's Science of Logic, with particular emphasis on the relationship between logic and metaphysics, the justification for beginning with pure being, and the nature of thinking and its relationship to being. The lecturer presents what he calls a "short argument" for the identity of thought and being, discusses the nature of dialectic, and explains why the beginning of the Logic must be pure, indeterminate being.

The lecture builds directly on the previous material from Jan21, which examined the transition from the Phenomenology to the Logic. It provides crucial context for understanding Hegel's claim that "Being is Nothing and Being is not Nothing" by explaining the nature of pure being as completely indeterminate and immediate.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Logic as Metaphysics

**Transcript Reference:** Lines 6-8
> "And so that's why Hegel says in the Encyclopedia, paragraph 24, the logic coincides with metaphysics. They have the same content."

**Analysis:** The lecturer establishes the fundamental identity between logic and metaphysics in Hegel's system. This identity is based on the claim that "the self-determining content of thought is structurally identical to the self-determining content of being" (lines 3-5). This provides the foundation for understanding why the Science of Logic is simultaneously a logic and a metaphysics.

**Alternative Interpretations:** Some might interpret this as a form of subjective idealism where thought creates being, but the lecturer explicitly rejects this interpretation later (lines 553-560).

### 2. The Short Argument

**Transcript Reference:** Lines 32-43
> "I think that the argument that I call the short argument is sufficient to establish the logic as being what the science of thinking and the science of metaphysics, the science of thinking and the science of being what being."

**Analysis:** The lecturer presents a "short argument" for the identity of logic and metaphysics, which is distinct from the longer argument presented in the Phenomenology. This argument is based on the claim that ordinary logical inference already presupposes the metaphysical import of logic.

**Alternative Interpretations:** The lecturer acknowledges that this short argument "won't repel any possible skepticism as to whether that is knowing, whether it is science, and whether it is all that science and knowing could be" (lines 36-39).

### 3. Logical Inference and Metaphysical Import

**Transcript Reference:** Lines 95-106
> "So you've also accepted that if P, then if P or Q. Now, you can't, as long as you accept this as a rule of inference in logic, you have to accept that it preserves truth. And if you accept that it preserves truth, you've accepted, essentially, a claim about reality."

**Analysis:** The lecturer argues that even the most basic logical inferences commit us to claims about reality. This is because accepting that logical inferences preserve truth is already to accept something about the structure of being.

**Alternative Interpretations:** This argument assumes that truth is a property of thoughts that relates them to reality, which some might question.

### 4. The Principle of Contradiction

**Transcript Reference:** Lines 138-168
> "Can you coherently entertain skepticism about the law of logic? There are no true contradictions."

**Analysis:** The lecturer argues that one cannot coherently be skeptical about the metaphysical import of the principle of contradiction. To entertain such skepticism would be to hold that "there are no self-contradictory thoughts, but maybe there are some true ones," which is self-undermining.

**Alternative Interpretations:** This argument presupposes what the lecturer calls "the constitutive conception of logic" and that "truth is the predicate of thoughts" (lines 169-179).

### 5. Thought as Transcendental

**Transcript Reference:** Lines 488-506
> "Anything that can be is the, and that means that thinkable is transcendental, not in the Kantian sense, but in the original sense in which unity, truth, and goodness are transcendental."

**Analysis:** The lecturer argues that thinkability is a transcendental property of being, meaning that all beings as such are thinkable. This is why the claim "there is something that cannot be thought" is self-undermining.

**Alternative Interpretations:** This position differs from Kant's transcendental idealism, as the lecturer explicitly notes. It also differs from Heidegger's focus on "meaningfulness" (Bedeutsamkeit) as the fundamental mode of access to being (lines 520-551).

### 6. Pure Being as Beginning

**Transcript Reference:** Lines 1050-1069
> "The beginning is therefore pure being."

**Analysis:** The lecturer explains why the beginning of the Logic must be pure being. The argument is that the beginning must be immediate (not mediated by anything else), and if it is immediate, it must be indeterminate (since determinacy entails negation).

**Alternative Interpretations:** The lecturer notes that this raises a potential problem for Hegel's system, which will be discussed in the next lecture (lines 1246-1253).

### 7. Determinacy and Negation

**Transcript Reference:** Lines 1086-1096
> "If it is immediate, then it is indeterminate. Why? Because determinacy entails negation. Why? Because determinacy is to be one thing rather than something else."

**Analysis:** The lecturer explains the Spinozist principle "omnis determinatio est negatio" (all determination is negation), which is crucial for understanding why pure being must be indeterminate.

**Alternative Interpretations:** This principle is attributed to Spinoza's letter to Jarig Jelles, though the lecturer notes that the word "omnis" is an interpolation (lines 1114-1116).

### 8. Dialectic

**Transcript Reference:** Lines 636-674
> "Hegel praises Kant's transcendental dialect. In particular, the Antinomies, he doesn't really care about the rest of the dialectic. He always identifies the dialect with the Antinomies. Because what Kant discovered is that there's a dialectic built into reason itself."

**Analysis:** The lecturer explains Hegel's conception of dialectic as not merely negative (generating contradictions) but also positive (generating new categories). This is what Hegel calls "speculative" philosophy.

**Alternative Interpretations:** The lecturer contrasts this with the original meaning of dialectic in ancient philosophy as "the art of refutation" (lines 602-605).

## Main Arguments Presented

### 1. The Short Argument for Logic as Metaphysics

**Transcript Location:** Lines 32-106

**Quoted Components:**
> "I think that the argument that I call the short argument is sufficient to establish the logic as being what the science of thinking and the science of metaphysics..."

**Reconstruction:**
1. In ordinary logical inference, we accept that certain inferences preserve truth.
2. In accepting this, we are already committed to claims about reality.
3. Therefore, logic already has metaphysical import.
4. If we can determine non-trivial facts about the content of thinking as such, we will have determined non-trivial facts about the structure of being.

**Interpretive Notes:** This argument is presented as a "short argument" that is sufficient to establish the identity of logic and metaphysics, though it won't repel all possible skepticism. The lecturer suggests that Hegel's Logic will show that the structure of thought is "significantly richer and more contentful than just the tautologies of propositional logic" (lines 261-266).

### 2. The Self-Undermining Nature of Skepticism about Logic's Metaphysical Import

**Transcript Location:** Lines 138-168

**Quoted Components:**
> "Can you coherently entertain skepticism about the law of logic? There are no true contradictions."

**Reconstruction:**
1. Consider the principle of contradiction: there are no true contradictions.
2. To be skeptical about its metaphysical import would be to hold: "There are no contradictory thoughts, but maybe there are some true contradictions in being."
3. But a true contradiction would be a contradictory thought.
4. So this skepticism is self-undermining.

**Interpretive Notes:** This argument assumes what the lecturer calls "the constitutive conception of logic" (that logic reveals the structure thoughts must have) and that "truth is the predicate of thoughts" (lines 169-179).

### 3. The Transcendental Nature of Thought

**Transcript Location:** Lines 488-506

**Quoted Components:**
> "Anything that can be is the, and that means that thinkable is transcendental..."

**Reconstruction:**
1. If thinking were just one capacity among others (like vision), then there could be objects we cannot think about, just as there are objects we cannot see.
2. But the claim "there is something that cannot be thought" is self-undermining (since in making it, we are thinking about that something).
3. Therefore, thinkability is transcendental - all beings as such are thinkable.

**Interpretive Notes:** The lecturer distinguishes this from Kant's sense of "transcendental" and connects it to the traditional doctrine that unity, truth, and goodness are transcendental properties of being.

### 4. The Necessity of Beginning with Pure Being

**Transcript Location:** Lines 1050-1096

**Quoted Components:**
> "The beginning is therefore pure being."

**Reconstruction:**
1. The beginning of the Logic must be immediate (not mediated by anything else).
2. If it were mediated, that which mediates it would be the true beginning.
3. If it is immediate, it must be indeterminate.
4. This is because determinacy entails negation (to be determinate is to be one thing rather than something else).
5. Therefore, the beginning must be pure, indeterminate being.

**Interpretive Notes:** This argument draws on the Spinozist principle "omnis determinatio est negatio" (all determination is negation). The lecturer notes that this raises a potential problem for Hegel's system, which will be discussed in the next lecture.

## Connection to Readings

### 1. Science of Logic pp.49-58

**Lecture Reference:** Lines 1050-1069
> "The beginning is therefore pure being."

**Analysis of Relationship:** The lecture directly addresses the key argument from the reading about why the beginning of the Logic must be pure being. The lecturer reconstructs Hegel's reasoning that the beginning must be immediate and therefore indeterminate, which corresponds to Hegel's statement in the reading: "It thus lies in the nature of a beginning itself that it should be being and nothing else" (p. 50).

### 2. Encyclopedia §24

**Lecture Reference:** Lines 6-8
> "And so that's why Hegel says in the Encyclopedia, paragraph 24, the logic coincides with metaphysics. They have the same content."

**Analysis of Relationship:** The lecturer cites this passage to establish the fundamental identity between logic and metaphysics in Hegel's system. This provides crucial context for understanding the metaphysical significance of the beginning with pure being in the Science of Logic.

### 3. Spinoza's Letter 50

**Lecture Reference:** Lines 1094-1116
> "And that requires not being or negation. Or in other words, Hegel is appealing to the Spittisist principle, omnis determinatio, as negatio."

**Analysis of Relationship:** The lecturer connects Hegel's understanding of determinacy as negation to Spinoza's principle "omnis determinatio est negatio." This principle is crucial for understanding why pure being must be indeterminate, which is a key point in the Science of Logic reading.

## Pre-Lecture Questions Addressed

### 1. How does Hegel's conception of philosophy as a "circle" differ from traditional linear conceptions?

**Lecture Reference:** Lines 1-19
> "It's a retreat to the ground, to the origin and the truth on which that with which the beginning was made, and from which it is in fact produced, depends."

**Analysis of Response:** The lecturer explains that for Hegel, philosophical progression is a "retreat to the ground" where the beginning and end are interconnected. This circular structure is essential to Hegel's system and distinguishes it from traditional linear conceptions of philosophical development.

**Further Questions:** How does this circularity relate to the specific dialectical movements within the Logic?

### 2. Why must the beginning be "pure indeterminacy"?

**Lecture Reference:** Lines 1086-1096
> "If it is immediate, then it is indeterminate. Why? Because determinacy entails negation. Why? Because determinacy is to be one thing rather than something else."

**Analysis of Response:** The lecturer explains that determinacy entails negation (to be determinate is to be one thing rather than something else). Since the beginning must be immediate (not mediated by anything else), it must also be indeterminate.

**Further Questions:** How does this indeterminacy relate to the claim that being and nothing are identical?

### 3. How can pure being be both immediate and the result of the Phenomenology?

**Lecture Reference:** Lines 957-970
> "Hegel begins by telling us that it can be neither immediate nor immediate, but then goes on immediately to say that it is both immediate and immediate. He says, in fact, that everything under heaven and on Earth is both immediate and immediate."

**Analysis of Response:** The lecturer acknowledges this apparent paradox but suggests that the mistake is assuming that if something is immediate, it isn't mediated and vice versa. The lecturer promises to explain this further in the next lecture.

**Further Questions:** What exactly does it mean for something to be both immediate and mediated?

### 4. Why does Hegel reject alternative beginnings (like the "I")?

**Lecture Reference:** Lines 1169-1187
> "However, there is a connection because the first principle of fixtus philosophy is I and Hegel thinks that's just as indeterminate as pure being. And so fixtus to be congratulated with a completely indeterminate starting point. But A, it's not absolute because being an I or being a subject, it's defined through what it isn't, namely the object."

**Analysis of Response:** The lecturer explains that Hegel rejects the "I" as a beginning because it is defined through its negative relationship to the object, making it not truly absolute or presuppositionless. Additionally, Fichte's system cannot progress beyond this starting point, whereas Hegel's can.

**Further Questions:** How exactly does Hegel's system progress beyond pure being?

## New Questions Raised

### 1. What is the relationship between human thinking and the topic of the Logic?

**Transcript Reference:** Lines 338-373
> "So your question puts, you're putting your finger on the question, what is the relationship between human thinking, an activity that occurs in space and time, in particular datable historical moment, have to think it as the topic of the logic? And that is not treated in the logic."

**Related Lecture Content:** The lecturer suggests that the relationship between finite, human thinking and the pure thinking that is the topic of the Logic is not addressed in the Logic itself but must be addressed elsewhere in Hegel's system.

**Implications:** This raises questions about how our finite, psychological thinking relates to the pure, logical thinking that is the topic of the Logic. It suggests that there may be a gap between the Logic as a science of pure thinking and our actual psychological processes of thinking.

### 2. How can the beginning be both immediate and mediated?

**Transcript Reference:** Lines 957-970
> "Hegel begins by telling us that it can be neither immediate nor immediate, but then goes on immediately to say that it is both immediate and immediate. He says, in fact, that everything under heaven and on Earth is both immediate and immediate."

**Related Lecture Content:** The lecturer identifies this as a potential paradox that needs to be resolved. He suggests that the mistake is assuming that if something is immediate, it isn't mediated and vice versa.

**Implications:** This raises questions about the nature of immediacy and mediation in Hegel's system and how they can coexist. It suggests that Hegel's dialectical approach may involve a more complex understanding of these concepts than traditional either/or thinking.

### 3. What is the relationship between the beginning of the Logic and sense certainty in the Phenomenology?

**Transcript Reference:** Lines 1141-1148
> "That means there's a thematic connection between the beginning of the logic and sense certainty. So one of the things we'll eventually have to talk about is what exactly is the relationship between the beginning of logic and sense certainty."

**Related Lecture Content:** The lecturer notes a connection between the pure being of the Logic and the sense certainty chapter of the Phenomenology but admits that he is "not entirely sure" what he thinks about this relationship.

**Implications:** This raises questions about how the pure being of the Logic relates to the immediate this-here-now of sense certainty in the Phenomenology. It suggests that there may be important connections between the two works that need to be explored further.

### 4. What is the future of philosophy after Hegel?

**Transcript Reference:** Lines 856-923
> "What does Hegel think about the future? And he doesn't say anything about it. And so some people think that means Hegel thinks there's no real future. It's all just this. Like, we're done."

**Related Lecture Content:** The lecturer discusses various interpretations of Hegel's view of the future of philosophy, including the possibility that Hegel thought philosophy had reached its culmination in his system.

**Implications:** This raises questions about the implications of Hegel's system for the future of philosophy. If Hegel's system is truly comprehensive, what room is there for philosophical progress beyond it?

## Connection to Previous Lectures

### 1. Jan21: Transition from Phenomenology to Logic

**Current Reference:** Lines 9-22
> "Hegel's just told us that the deduction of that science, the science that is both logic and metaphysics, is the phenomenology of spirit itself."

**Development Analysis:** The lecturer connects the current discussion of logic as metaphysics to the previous lecture's focus on the transition from the Phenomenology to the Logic. He notes that the Phenomenology serves as the "deduction" of the science of logic/metaphysics, though he also suggests that Hegel may have a "shorter argument" for this conclusion.

### 2. Jan14: Sense Certainty

**Current Reference:** Lines 1141-1148
> "That means there's a thematic connection between the beginning of the logic and sense certainty."

**Development Analysis:** The lecturer notes a connection between the pure being of the Logic and the sense certainty chapter of the Phenomenology discussed in the Jan14 lecture. This suggests a continuity between the two works, though the exact nature of this connection remains to be explored.

## Areas Requiring Further Investigation

### 1. The Relationship Between Immediacy and Mediation

**Lecture Reference:** Lines 957-970
> "Hegel begins by telling us that it can be neither immediate nor immediate, but then goes on immediately to say that it is both immediate and immediate."

**Research Need:** The lecturer identifies this as a potential paradox that will be addressed in the next lecture. Further investigation is needed to understand how something can be both immediate and mediated in Hegel's system.

### 2. The Relationship Between the Beginning of Logic and Sense Certainty

**Lecture Reference:** Lines 1141-1148
> "So one of the things we'll eventually have to talk about is what exactly is the relationship between the beginning of logic and sense certainty. And I am not entirely sure what I think about that."

**Research Need:** The lecturer admits uncertainty about this relationship, suggesting a need for further investigation into how the pure being of the Logic relates to the immediate this-here-now of sense certainty in the Phenomenology.

### 3. The Problem of the Beginning

**Lecture Reference:** Lines 1246-1253
> "That is exactly the problem that we'll talk about next week. That is the problem on which the entire Hegelian enterprise potentially falters."

**Research Need:** The lecturer suggests that there is a fundamental problem with Hegel's account of the beginning that will be discussed in the next lecture. This requires further investigation to understand the nature of this problem and its implications for Hegel's system.

### 4. Supplementing with Pippin's Work

**Research Need:** Given that we only have the second half of the lecture transcript, further investigation of Pippin's "Logic and Metaphysics" (Chapter 2) is needed to supplement our understanding of the concepts discussed in the first half of the lecture. Additionally, Pippin's Chapters 4 and 5 on "Logic and Negation" and "Logic of Being" may provide valuable insights into the being-nothing relationship and the Doctrine of Being.

## Integration with Course Themes

### 1. The Identity of Thought and Being

**Lecture Evidence:** Lines 3-8
> "The self-determining content of thought is structurally identical to the self-determining content of being. And so that's why Hegel says in the Encyclopedia, paragraph 24, the logic coincides with metaphysics."

**Previous References:** This theme was introduced in the Jan21 lecture on the transition from Phenomenology to Logic.

**Interpretation:** This theme is central to the current lecture. The lecturer develops it further by providing a "short argument" for this identity based on the metaphysical import of ordinary logical inference. This identity is fundamental to Hegel's project of developing a science that is simultaneously logic and metaphysics.

### 2. The Problem of Beginning

**Lecture Evidence:** Lines 1050-1069
> "The beginning is therefore pure being."

**Previous References:** This theme was introduced in the Jan21 lecture.

**Interpretation:** This theme is developed further in the current lecture. The lecturer explains why the beginning of the Logic must be pure, indeterminate being, drawing on the principle that determinacy entails negation. This provides crucial context for understanding the first categories of the Logic: being, nothing, and becoming.

### 3. Dialectic

**Lecture Evidence:** Lines 636-674
> "Hegel praises Kant's transcendental dialect. In particular, the Antinomies, he doesn't really care about the rest of the dialectic. He always identifies the dialect with the Antinomies. Because what Kant discovered is that there's a dialectic built into reason itself."

**Previous References:** This theme was introduced in previous lectures.

**Interpretation:** This theme is developed further in the current lecture. The lecturer explains Hegel's conception of dialectic as not merely negative (generating contradictions) but also positive (generating new categories). This is what Hegel calls "speculative" philosophy, which works by "uncovering contradictions or letting concepts contradict themselves and then resolve that contradict in a higher concept" (lines 662-664).

### 4. The Relationship Between Logic and Metaphysics

**Lecture Evidence:** Lines 6-8
> "And so that's why Hegel says in the Encyclopedia, paragraph 24, the logic coincides with metaphysics. They have the same content."

**Previous References:** This theme was introduced in the Jan21 lecture.

**Interpretation:** This theme is central to the current lecture. The lecturer explains why logic and metaphysics have the same content in Hegel's system, based on the identity of the self-determining content of thought and the self-determining content of being. This provides the foundation for understanding the metaphysical significance of the logical categories developed in the Science of Logic.

## Source Analysis

This analysis is based on the second half of the Jan28 lecture transcript (PHL316_hegel_jan28_02.txt). The transcript appears to begin mid-sentence, suggesting that we are missing the first part of the lecture. Despite this limitation, the transcript provides valuable insights into the lecturer's interpretation of the beginning of Hegel's Science of Logic and the relationship between logic and metaphysics.

The lecturer presents what he calls a "short argument" for the identity of logic and metaphysics, which is distinct from the longer argument presented in the Phenomenology. This argument is based on the claim that ordinary logical inference already presupposes the metaphysical import of logic. The lecturer also explains why the beginning of the Logic must be pure, indeterminate being, drawing on the principle that determinacy entails negation.

The transcript includes several student questions and the lecturer's responses, which help to clarify his interpretation and address potential objections. The lecturer also makes connections to other philosophers, including Spinoza, Fichte, and Kant, providing historical context for Hegel's position.

Given that we only have the second half of the lecture, there may be important context or arguments from the first half that would enhance our understanding. Additionally, the transcript includes some unclear or incomplete sentences, which may affect our interpretation. Despite these limitations, the transcript provides a rich source for understanding the lecturer's interpretation of the beginning of Hegel's Science of Logic.

To supplement our understanding, we have drawn on Pippin's work, particularly Chapter 2 on "Logic and Metaphysics," which provides valuable insights into the relationship between logic and metaphysics in Hegel's system. This secondary literature helps to fill gaps in our understanding of the concepts discussed in the lecture.
