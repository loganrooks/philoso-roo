# Revised Analysis: Language's Role in Sense-Certainty
Date: March 6, 2025
Focus: Technical Terms and Their Specific Operation

## 1. What "Linguistic Structure" Means Here

### A. In §97's Key Passage
Quote:
```
"What we say is: 'This', i.e. the universal This; or, 'it is', i.e. Being in general. Of course, we do not envisage the universal This or Being in general, but we utter the universal"
```

Technical Analysis:
1. "Structure" here means:
   - Not: arrangement of words/grammar
   - But: the necessary way language operates
   - Specifically: how it makes universal what consciousness means as particular

2. Evidence from text:
   - "What we say" vs "what we mean"
   - Universal emerges in very act of saying
   - Not a choice but necessity

### B. "Divine Nature" Clarification (§110)
Quote:
```
"language—which has the divine nature of directly reversing the meaning of what is meant, of making it into something else"
```

Technical Meaning:
1. "Divine":
   - Not: supernatural or religious
   - But: necessary and self-operating
   - Like Greek logos: rational ordering principle

2. "Reversing":
   - Not: simple opposition
   - But: transformation through saying
   - Specifically: particular becomes universal in being said

## 2. What "Showing" Means

### A. In §97's Context
Quote:
```
"language, as we see, is the more truthful; in it, we ourselves directly refute what we mean to say"
```

Technical Sense:
1. "Showing" here means:
   - Not: pointing to or displaying
   - But: making manifest through operation
   - Specifically: truth emerges through language's own movement

2. Evidence:
   - "More truthful" than consciousness
   - Truth emerges against intention
   - Through language's own operation

### B. The Writing Example (§95)
Quote:
```
"We write down this truth... If now, this noon, we look again at the written truth we shall have to say that it has become stale."
```

Technical Operation:
1. "Writing" functions as:
   - Not: mere recording
   - But: making temporal structure visible
   - Through: preservation that shows change

## 3. Truth's Technical Operation

### A. In Language's Movement
Quote from §110:
```
"what is called the unutterable is nothing else than the untrue, the irrational, what is merely meant"
```

Technical Analysis:
1. "Truth" here means:
   - Not: correspondence to facts
   - Not: coherence of statements
   - But: what emerges through language's operation

2. How it operates:
   - Through actual saying
   - Against mere meaning
   - As universal determination

### B. The Universal's Specific Sense
Quote from §97:
```
"we utter the universal; in other words, we do not strictly say what in this sense-certainty we mean to say"
```

Technical Meaning:
1. "Universal" here:
   - Not: general concept
   - Not: common property
   - But: what persists through difference

2. Evidence:
   - Emerges through saying
   - Operates against intention
   - Shows truth's structure

## 4. Technical Term Relations

### A. Language-Truth-Universal
1. Necessary Connection:
   - Language operates universally
   - Truth emerges through this operation
   - Universal is this truth's form

2. Not External Relations:
   - Not three separate things
   - But one movement
   - In three moments

### B. Movement's Technical Sense
1. In This Context:
   - Not: temporal sequence
   - Not: logical steps
   - But: self-developing necessity

2. Evidenced By:
   - Language's own operation
   - Truth's emergence
   - Universal's presence

## 5. Methodological Implications

### A. For Reading Practice
1. Technical Terms:
   - Must be traced in text
   - Through their operation
   - Not imported meanings

2. Movement Analysis:
   - Follow actual operation
   - Not assumed meanings
   - Through textual evidence

### B. For Understanding
1. Key Point:
   - Terms get meaning from operation
   - Not prior definitions
   - Through actual movement

2. Verification:
   - Always textual
   - Through operation
   - In specific context
