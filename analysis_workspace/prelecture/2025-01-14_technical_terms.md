# Technical Term Analysis: Movement and Necessity in Sense-Certainty
Date: March 6, 2025
Focus: Precise Technical Operation

## 1. "Movement" in §107

### A. Textual Definition
Quote:
```
"In this pointing-out, then, we see merely a movement which takes the following course: (1) I point out the 'Now', and it is asserted to be the truth. I point it out, however, as something that has been, or as something that has been superseded; I set aside the first truth. (2) I now assert as the second truth that it has been, that it is superseded. (3) But what has been, is not; I set aside the second truth, its having been, its supersession, and thereby negate the negation of the 'Now', and thus return to the first assertion, that the 'Now' is."
```

Technical Analysis:
1. What Movement IS NOT:
   - Not physical motion
   - Not mere logical steps
   - Not psychological process
   - Not temporal sequence

2. What Movement IS:
   - The self-developing operation of thought
   - Through its own determinations
   - By internal necessity
   - As one unified process

### B. Evidence from Operation
Quote:
```
"this first, thus reflected into itself, is not exactly the same as it was to begin with, viz. something immediate; on the contrary, it is something that is reflected into itself"
```

Technical Features:
1. Movement's Structure:
   - Self-reflection
   - Through determinate negation
   - Returning differently

## 2. "Necessity" in §97

### A. Textual Operation
Quote:
```
"language, as we see, is the more truthful; in it, we ourselves directly refute what we mean to say, and since the universal is the true [content] of sense-certainty and language expresses this true [content] alone, it is just not possible for us ever to say, or express in words, a sensuous being that we mean"
```

Technical Analysis:
1. What Necessity IS NOT:
   - Not causal determination
   - Not logical entailment
   - Not natural law
   - Not subjective compulsion

2. What Necessity IS:
   - The internal self-determination of thought
   - Through its own operation
   - As revealed in language
   - Against our intention

### B. Evidence in Operation
Quote:
```
"it is just not possible for us ever to say..."
```

Technical Features:
1. Necessity's Structure:
   - Not external constraint
   - But internal impossibility
   - Through actual operation

## 3. The Unity of Movement and Necessity

### A. In Language's Operation
Quote:
```
"language—which has the divine nature of directly reversing the meaning of what is meant, of making it into something else"
```

Technical Analysis:
1. Unified Operation Shows:
   - Movement AS necessity
   - Necessity IN movement
   - Both through language

2. How This Works:
   - Language operates
   - Operation shows necessity
   - Through its own movement

### B. In Truth's Emergence
Quote:
```
"The 'Now', and pointing out the 'Now', are thus so constituted that neither the one nor the other is something immediate and simple, but a movement which contains various moments"
```

Technical Features:
1. Truth Emerges Through:
   - Movement's necessity
   - Necessary movement
   - As one operation

## 4. Methodological Implications

### A. For Reading
1. We Must:
   - Follow actual operation
   - Not import categories
   - Let text show necessity

2. This Means:
   - Tracing movement in detail
   - Seeing how it operates
   - Understanding its necessity

### B. For Understanding
1. Key Points:
   - Movement shows itself
   - Through its operation
   - As necessary

2. Verification:
   - In text's operation
   - Through actual movement
   - Not external criteria

## 5. Relation to Other Terms

### A. With Language
1. Language Shows:
   - Movement's necessity
   - Necessary movement
   - In actual operation

2. Through:
   - Its own operation
   - Against intention
   - In truth's emergence

### B. With Truth
1. Truth Emerges:
   - Through necessary movement
   - In movement's necessity
   - As one operation

2. Verified By:
   - Actual operation
   - In language
   - Through movement
