# Reading Questions: Hegel's Science of Logic - Being, Nothing, and Becoming

## Introduction

These questions are designed to guide your reading of Hegel's Science of Logic, pp. 59-82, which covers the beginning of the Logic with the categories of Being, Nothing, and Becoming. The questions focus on key passages and concepts, helping you to engage critically with Hegel's text and prepare for class discussion.

## Section A: Being

1. Hegel defines Being as "pure being â€“ without further determination" and as "indeterminate immediacy" (p. 59). What does he mean by these terms? Why does he characterize Being in this way?

2. Hegel claims that Being "has no difference within it, nor any outwardly" (p. 59). Why is this lack of difference important for understanding Being as the beginning of the Logic?

3. Hegel states that Being is "pure indeterminateness and emptiness" and that "there is nothing to be intuited in it" (p. 59). How can we think about something that has no content? Is this even possible?

4. At the end of the section on Being, Hegel makes the startling claim that Being "is in fact nothing, and neither more nor less than nothing" (p. 59). What leads him to this conclusion? Is this a logical error or a profound insight?

## Section B: Nothing

5. Hegel defines Nothing as "simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, complete absence of determination and content; lack of all distinction within" (p. 59). How does this definition parallel his definition of Being? What does this parallelism suggest?

6. Hegel notes that "To intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning; the two are distinguished and so nothing is (concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking" (p. 59). What paradox is Hegel pointing to here? How can Nothing "exist" in our thinking?

7. At the end of the section on Nothing, Hegel claims that Nothing is "the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being" (p. 59). What does this tell us about the relationship between Being and Nothing?

## Section C: Becoming

8. Hegel begins this section with the claim: "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same" (p. 59). Given the definitions he has provided, why does he think Being and Nothing are the same? Do you find this claim convincing?

9. Hegel immediately complicates this claim by adding: "But the truth is just as much that they are not without distinction; it is rather that they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable" (p. 60). How can Being and Nothing be both the same and "absolutely distinct"? What kind of logic is at work here?

10. Hegel claims that the truth of Being and Nothing is "this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming" (p. 60). What does he mean by this? How does Becoming resolve the contradiction between the identity and difference of Being and Nothing?

11. Hegel emphasizes that Being "has passed over" into Nothing and Nothing into Being, not that one "passes over" into the other (p. 59). What is the significance of this distinction? Why does Hegel insist on the past tense?

12. Hegel describes Becoming as "doubly determined" with two directions: coming-to-be (Nothing passing over into Being) and ceasing-to-be (Being passing over into Nothing) (p. 60). How do these two directions relate to each other? Why are both necessary for understanding Becoming?

## Section D: Sublation and Determinate Being

13. Hegel claims that Becoming "collects itself in quiescent unity" and that this unity is Determinate Being (p. 83). What does he mean by this? How does Becoming resolve itself into Determinate Being?

14. Hegel introduces the concept of "sublation" (Aufheben) as "one of the most important concepts of philosophy" (p. 81). What is the double meaning of this term, and why is it so important for understanding Hegel's dialectical method?

15. Hegel states that "What is sublated does not thereby turn into nothing" but is rather "something mediated" (p. 81). How does this help us understand the relationship between Being, Nothing, Becoming, and Determinate Being?

16. Hegel notes that in Determinate Being, Being and Nothing "no longer are being and nothing but possess a different determination" (p. 82). What is this different determination? How have Being and Nothing been transformed in Determinate Being?

## Remark 1: Historical Context

17. Hegel discusses the views of Parmenides (who held that "only being is") and Heraclitus (who held that "all is becoming") (p. 60). How does Hegel's own view relate to these historical positions? Does he side with one over the other, or does he offer a synthesis?

18. Hegel criticizes the proposition "Ex nihilo, nihil fit" ("From nothing comes nothing") as "a barren tautology" (p. 61). Why does he reject this principle? How does his own view of the relationship between Being and Nothing challenge it?

19. Hegel claims that those who hold that "nothing is just nothing" are "subscribing to the abstract pantheism of the Eleatics and essentially also to that of Spinoza" (p. 61). What does he mean by this? How is the separation of Being and Nothing related to pantheism?

## Remark 2: The Paradox of Unity

20. Hegel acknowledges that the proposition "being and nothing are one and the same" seems paradoxical (p. 67). Why does this proposition seem paradoxical to common sense? How does Hegel defend it?

21. Hegel argues that the proposition "being and nothing are one and the same" contains a contradiction that "turns out to vanish spontaneously" (p. 68). What is this contradiction, and how does it vanish?

22. Hegel claims that "the form of a judgment" is "not adept to express speculative truths" (p. 68). Why does he think this? What limitations of the judgment form is he pointing to?

23. Hegel suggests that the term "unity" is problematic because it "designates a subjective reflection" and suggests "a connection that arises from comparison" (p. 68). Why is this problematic for understanding the relationship between Being and Nothing? What alternative does he suggest?

## Remark 3: The Inseparability of Being and Nothing

24. Hegel argues that Being and Nothing have "no subsistence on their own but are only in becoming" (p. 70). What does he mean by this? How does this challenge the common view that Being and Nothing are separate concepts?

25. Hegel criticizes those who try to hold Being and Nothing "as protected against transition" (p. 70). Why does he think this attempt is misguided? What consequences does it have for understanding Becoming?

26. Hegel challenges those who insist on the distinction between Being and Nothing to "state in what the distinction consists" (p. 69). Why does he think this is impossible? What does this impossibility reveal about the nature of Being and Nothing?

## Remark 4: The Dialectic of Becoming

27. Hegel discusses a dialectic that claims to prove that "a beginning of the world or of anything is not possible" (p. 91). What is this dialectic, and how does it relate to Hegel's own view of the relationship between Being and Nothing?

28. Hegel criticizes this dialectic as resting on "fixing the opposition of being and nothing" (p. 91). Why does he think this is problematic? How does his own view of Being and Nothing as moments of Becoming offer a different perspective?

29. Hegel distinguishes between "sophistry" and "dialectic" (p. 92). What is the difference between these two forms of argumentation according to Hegel? Why does he consider his own approach dialectical rather than sophistical?

## General Questions

30. How does the movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming exemplify Hegel's dialectical method? What does this first triad tell us about how the rest of the Logic will develop?

31. Hegel claims that the unity of Being and Nothing in Becoming is "the first truth" and will "stand once and for all as foundation" for the rest of the Logic (p. 62). Why is this first triad so foundational? How does it set the pattern for the development of all the categories that follow?

32. Hegel's treatment of Being and Nothing challenges traditional logic, which is based on the principles of identity (A = A) and non-contradiction (not both A and not-A). How does Hegel's dialectical logic differ from traditional logic? Is he rejecting these principles or reinterpreting them?

33. Hegel's claim that Being and Nothing are the same seems to violate common sense. Is Hegel simply being provocative, or is there a deeper philosophical insight here? How might we make sense of this claim in a way that doesn't simply dismiss it as nonsense?

34. Hegel's Logic begins with the most abstract, indeterminate concepts and progressively develops more concrete, determinate ones. Why does he take this approach? What advantages does it have over beginning with concrete, determinate concepts?

35. How does Hegel's treatment of Being and Nothing relate to his overall philosophical project? What does it tell us about his view of the relationship between thought and reality, logic and metaphysics?
