## Overview and Context

This analysis examines the beginning of the Doctrine of Being in Hegel's Science of Logic (pp.49-58), focusing on the circular nature of Hegel's system, the justification for beginning with pure being, the relationship between being and nothing, and the nature of quality as the first determination of being. This reading follows directly from the Jan21 material, which examined the transition from the Phenomenology to the Logic.

The current reading is particularly significant as it:
1. Elaborates on the circular structure of Hegel's philosophical system
2. Provides a detailed justification for why the Logic must begin with pure being
3. Introduces the dialectical relationship between being and nothing
4. Establishes quality as the first determination of being

This analysis will pay special attention to the relationship between being and nothing, as this is directly relevant to the essay prompt: "Explain Hegel's reasons for claiming in the Science of Logic both that Being is Nothing and that Being is not Nothing."

## 1. Circularity in Hegel's System

### Key Passage Analysis

> "Essential to science is not so much that a pure immediacy should be the beginning, but that the whole of science is in itself a circle in which the first becomes also the last, and the last also the first." (p. 49)

This passage reveals a fundamental aspect of Hegel's philosophical method: the circular structure of his system. Unlike traditional linear conceptions of philosophical development, Hegel envisions philosophy as a self-enclosed circle where the beginning and end are interconnected.

### Positive Determination of Circularity

Hegel's circularity is:

1. **Self-Grounding**: The system justifies itself through its own development rather than appealing to external foundations
   
2. **Teleological**: The beginning contains within itself the principle of its development toward the end
   
3. **Retrospective**: The end reveals the truth of the beginning, showing that what appeared immediate was actually mediated
   
4. **Self-Enclosed**: The system forms a complete whole where each moment is necessary for the others
   
5. **Self-Referential**: The system reflects on its own conditions of possibility

As Hegel states: "It must be admitted that it is an essential consideration – one which will be found elaborated again within the logic itself – that progression is a retreat to the ground, to the origin and the truth on which that with which the beginning was made, and from which it is in fact produced, depends" (p. 49).

### Negative Determination of Circularity

Hegel's circularity is NOT:

1. **Viciously Circular**: Not a logical fallacy where the conclusion is assumed in the premises
   
2. **Merely Repetitive**: Not a simple return to the same point without development
   
3. **Arbitrary**: Not a subjective choice of arrangement but a necessary structure of thought itself
   
4. **Closed to External Reality**: Not a self-contained system divorced from concrete experience
   
5. **Merely Formal**: Not an empty methodological principle but the very movement of content itself

### The Beginning-Result Relationship

Hegel elaborates on this circular structure by explaining the relationship between beginning and result:

> "Conversely, it follows that it is just as necessary to consider as result that into which the movement returns as to its ground. In this respect, the first is just as much the ground, and the last a derivative; since the movement makes its start from the first and by correct inferences arrives at the last as the ground, this last is result." (p. 49)

This passage reveals a dialectical understanding of the beginning-result relationship:

1. The beginning (pure being) appears immediate but is actually the result of the Phenomenology's development
2. The result (the Absolute Idea) appears as the end but is actually the ground of the beginning
3. The movement from beginning to result is simultaneously a "retreat to the ground"

### Implications for Presuppositionlessness

This circular structure has important implications for Hegel's claim that the Logic is presuppositionless:

1. The beginning is presuppositionless in the sense that it does not rely on external foundations
2. Yet it is not absolutely presuppositionless, as it emerges from the development of consciousness in the Phenomenology
3. The circularity allows the beginning to be both immediate (when viewed in isolation) and mediated (when viewed in relation to the whole)

As Hegel states: "But for this reason, because it is as absolute ground that the result finally emerges, the progression of this cognition is not anything provisory, still problematic and hypothetical, but must be determined through the nature of the matter at issue and of the content itself" (p. 49-50).

## 2. Pure Being as Beginning

### Key Passage Analysis

> "It thus lies in the nature of a beginning itself that it should be being and nothing else. There is no need, therefore, of other preparations to enter philosophy, no need of further reflections or access points." (p. 50)

This passage presents Hegel's central claim that philosophy must begin with pure being. This is not an arbitrary choice but follows from the very nature of what a beginning must be.

### Positive Determination of Pure Being as Beginning

Pure being as the beginning is:

1. **Absolutely Immediate**: Without mediation or determination by anything else
   
2. **Completely Abstract**: Devoid of any specific content or determination
   
3. **Universally Presuppositionless**: Not dependent on any particular presupposition
   
4. **Self-Justifying**: Justified by the very nature of what a beginning must be
   
5. **Necessary**: Not an arbitrary choice but the only possible beginning for philosophy

As Hegel explains: "Here, at the beginning, where the fact itself is not yet at hand, philosophy is an empty word, a received and yet unjustified notion. Pure knowledge yields only this negative determination, namely that the beginning ought to be abstract" (p. 50).

### Negative Determination of Pure Being as Beginning

Pure being as the beginning is NOT:

1. **Determinate**: Not a specific, concrete entity or concept
   
2. **Empirical**: Not derived from sensory experience
   
3. **Subjective**: Not dependent on the particular consciousness of the thinker
   
4. **Representational**: Not a mental image or representation
   
5. **Foundational**: Not a secure foundation on which the system is built externally

### The Immediacy-Mediation Paradox

Hegel addresses the apparent paradox that pure being must be both immediate and the result of the Phenomenology's development:

> "Being is what makes the beginning here; it is presented indeed as originating through mediation, but a mediation which at the same time sublates itself, and the presupposition is of a pure knowledge which is the result of finite knowledge, of consciousness." (p. 49)

This passage reveals that:

1. Pure being originates through mediation (the development of consciousness in the Phenomenology)
2. Yet this mediation "sublates itself," allowing being to appear as immediate
3. The presupposition is "pure knowledge," which is itself the result of the Phenomenology

This complex relationship allows Hegel to maintain both that:
- The Logic has a presuppositionless beginning (when viewed internally)
- The Logic emerges from the Phenomenology (when viewed in the context of the whole system)

### Rejection of Alternative Beginnings

Hegel explicitly rejects alternative beginnings for philosophy, particularly the "I" proposed by Fichte:

> "The 'I,' this immediate consciousness of the self, appears from the start to be both itself an immediate something and something with which we are acquainted in a much deeper sense than with any other representation... But the 'I' is, as such, at the same time also a concrete, or rather, the 'I' is the most concrete of all things – the consciousness of itself as an infinitely manifold world." (p. 53)

Hegel rejects the "I" as a beginning because:

1. It is concrete rather than abstract
2. It contains a multiplicity of determinations
3. It presupposes the subject-object distinction
4. It appears immediate but actually contains mediation
5. It would require an "absolute act" to purify it to the level of abstraction needed for a beginning

## 3. Quality as Determinateness

### Key Passage Analysis

> "Being is determined, first, as against another in general; secondly, it is internally self-determining; thirdly, as this preliminary division is cast off, it is the abstract indeterminateness and immediacy in which it must be the beginning." (p. 57)

This passage outlines the three determinations of being, with quality as the first determination. It shows how being, which begins as abstract indeterminateness, develops into determinate being through quality.

### Positive Determination of Quality

Quality as the first determination of being is:

1. **Immediate Identity with Being**: Quality is not separate from being but constitutes its immediate determinateness
   
2. **Boundary-Setting**: Quality establishes the boundary between a being and what it is not
   
3. **Affirmative Determinateness**: Quality is the positive character of a being
   
4. **Inherent to Being**: Quality is not external to being but constitutes what it is
   
5. **Prerequisite for Quantity**: Quality must be established before quantity can be determined

As Hegel states: "Qualitative determinateness is on the contrary one with its being, it neither transcends it nor stays within it but is its immediate restrictedness" (p. 56-57).

### Negative Determination of Quality

Quality is NOT:

1. **Separable from Being**: Not an attribute added to being but constitutive of it
   
2. **Quantitative**: Not a matter of degree or magnitude
   
3. **Relational**: Not primarily defined by external relations
   
4. **Subjective**: Not imposed by the observer but inherent in being itself
   
5. **Mediated**: Not the result of a complex process of mediation (at this stage)

### Quality vs. Quantity

Hegel explicitly addresses why quality precedes quantity in his system:

> "It is clear from a comparison of quality with quantity that the former is by nature first. For quantity is quality which has already become negative; magnitude is the determinateness which, no longer one with being but already distinguished from it, is the sublated quality that has become indifferent." (p. 56-57)

This passage reveals that:

1. Quality is "by nature first" because it is immediately one with being
2. Quantity emerges only when quality is "sublated" and becomes "indifferent"
3. Quantity presupposes quality, but quality does not presuppose quantity
4. The transition from quality to quantity is a movement from immediate identity to mediated difference

### The Three Moments of Being

Hegel outlines three moments in the development of being:

1. **Being as Determinateness (Quality)**: Being determined against another
2. **Being as Magnitude (Quantity)**: Being as sublated determinateness
3. **Being as Measure**: Being as qualitatively determined quantity

This structure reveals that being is not static but develops through these moments, with quality as the necessary first moment.

## 4. Being-Nothing-Becoming

### Key Passage Analysis

> "As yet there is nothing, and something is supposed to become. The beginning is not pure nothing but a nothing, rather, from which something is to proceed; also being, therefore, is already contained in the beginning. Therefore, the beginning contains both, being and nothing; it is the unity of being and nothing, or is non-being which is at the same time being, and being which is at the same time non-being." (p. 51)

This passage directly addresses the relationship between being and nothing, showing that they are both distinct and identical in the beginning.

### Positive Determination of Being-Nothing Relationship

The relationship between being and nothing is:

1. **Dialectical Unity**: Being and nothing form a unity of opposites
   
2. **Mutual Implication**: Each implies and contains the other
   
3. **Dynamic**: Their relationship is not static but generates movement
   
4. **Necessary**: Not contingent but following from the nature of pure thought
   
5. **Productive**: Their unity produces becoming as the first concrete category

As Hegel states: "The opposites, being and non-being, are therefore in immediate union in it; or the beginning is their undifferentiated unity" (p. 51).

### Negative Determination of Being-Nothing Relationship

The relationship between being and nothing is NOT:

1. **External Opposition**: Not two separate entities standing outside each other
   
2. **Formal Contradiction**: Not a logical error to be avoided
   
3. **Arbitrary Association**: Not a contingent connection
   
4. **Static Identity**: Not a fixed equation that "being = nothing"
   
5. **Merely Conceptual**: Not just a matter of how we think about them but inherent in their nature

### The Identity and Difference of Being and Nothing

Hegel's claim that being both is and is not nothing can be understood through this passage:

> "Further, being and nothing are present in the beginning as distinguished; for the beginning points to something other – it is a non-being which refers to an other; that which begins, as yet is not; it only reaches out to being. The being contained in the beginning is such, therefore, that it distances itself from non-being or sublates it as something which is opposed to it." (p. 51)

This passage reveals that:

1. Being and nothing are distinguished (being is not nothing)
2. Yet they are also in "immediate union" (being is nothing)
3. Their distinction lies in their directional sense:
   - Being points toward determination
   - Nothing points toward indetermination
4. Their identity lies in their complete indeterminacy:
   - Pure being has no determinations
   - Pure nothing has no determinations
   - Therefore, they are indistinguishable in content

### Becoming as Their Unity

The unity of being and nothing produces becoming:

> "An analysis of the beginning would thus yield the concept of the unity of being and non-being – or, in a more reflected form, the concept of the unity of differentiated and undifferentiated being – or of the identity of identity and non-identity." (p. 51-52)

This passage shows that:

1. Becoming is the first concrete category that emerges from the dialectic
2. Becoming contains both being and nothing as moments
3. Becoming resolves the contradiction between being and nothing
4. Becoming is the truth of both being and nothing

## Integration with Previous Material

### Connection to Jan21 Analysis

The current reading builds directly on the Jan21 analysis of the transition from the Phenomenology to the Logic:

1. **Absolute Knowing to Pure Being**: The Jan21 analysis showed how Absolute Knowing overcomes the subject-object opposition, creating the possibility for the pure thinking of the Logic. The current reading shows how this pure thinking begins with pure being.

2. **Presuppositionlessness**: The Jan21 analysis introduced the concept of a presuppositionless beginning. The current reading elaborates on this concept, showing how pure being can be both presuppositionless and the result of the Phenomenology.

3. **Circularity**: The Jan21 analysis suggested that Hegel's system is circular rather than linear. The current reading explicitly confirms this, stating that "the whole of science is in itself a circle in which the first becomes also the last, and the last also the first."

4. **Immediacy and Mediation**: The Jan21 analysis explored the relationship between immediacy and mediation. The current reading develops this theme, showing how pure being is both immediate in itself and mediated through the Phenomenology.

### Connection to Pippin's Analysis

Pippin's analysis of "Logic and Metaphysics" (Chapter 2) provides valuable context for understanding the current reading:

1. **Logic as Metaphysics**: Pippin explains that for Hegel, logic is metaphysics because the forms of thought are the forms of being. This helps us understand why Hegel begins the Logic with pure being rather than with a subjective category like the "I."

2. **The Emancipatory Dimension**: Pippin highlights the emancipatory dimension of Hegel's logic, which is implicit in the current reading's emphasis on the self-determining nature of thought.

3. **The Identity of Thought and Being**: Pippin's analysis of the identity of thought and being helps us understand why Hegel can claim that pure being, as a category of thought, is also a category of reality.

4. **The Problem of Beginning**: Pippin discusses the problem of beginning in philosophy, which is a central theme in the current reading.

## Essay Preparation

### The Rules of Hegel's Logic

The current reading provides insights into the "rules" that govern Hegel's Logic:

1. **What Hegel is entitled to assume**:
   - The results of the Phenomenology (as sublated)
   - The necessity of a presuppositionless beginning
   - The self-determining nature of thought

2. **What Hegel is not entitled to assume**:
   - Specific empirical content
   - Subjective representations
   - External foundations or principles
   - Determinate concepts at the beginning

3. **How these rules govern the movement from being to nothing**:
   - The movement must be immanent, not imposed from outside
   - The movement must follow from the nature of pure being itself
   - The movement must be necessary, not contingent
   - The movement must be dialectical, not linear

### The Nature of Being and Nothing

The reading clarifies what Hegel means by "being" and "nothing":

1. **What they are**:
   - Categories of pure thought
   - Moments in the dialectical development
   - Completely indeterminate
   - Mutually implicated

2. **Whether they are concepts, representations, entities, etc.**:
   - They are pure thought-determinations, not representations
   - They are logical categories, not entities
   - They are moments in the development of the Concept, not subjective ideas

3. **How they are both identical and different**:
   - Identical in their complete indeterminacy
   - Different in their directional sense
   - Identical in content but different in form
   - Both necessary moments in the dialectic

### The Movement from Being to Nothing

The reading explains how Hegel "gets from" being to nothing:

1. **The immanent development**:
   - Pure being, as completely indeterminate, has no content
   - This lack of content makes it indistinguishable from nothing
   - The very attempt to think pure being reveals it as nothing

2. **The necessity of this movement**:
   - Not a contingent association but a necessary development
   - Follows from the nature of pure being itself
   - Cannot be otherwise without introducing determinations

3. **Conformity to the "rules" of the Logic**:
   - The movement is immanent, not imposed
   - The movement is necessary, not contingent
   - The movement is dialectical, not linear

### The Role of Contradiction

The reading illuminates the role of the contradiction that being both is and is not nothing:

1. **Why being both is and is not nothing**:
   - Is nothing: Both are completely indeterminate
   - Is not nothing: They have different directional sense

2. **How this contradiction drives the dialectical movement**:
   - The contradiction cannot remain static
   - It generates becoming as its resolution
   - Becoming contains both being and nothing as moments

3. **The role of this contradiction in Hegel's larger project**:
   - Demonstrates the dialectical nature of thought
   - Shows that contradictions are productive rather than merely negative
   - Establishes the pattern for the entire Logic

## Questions for Further Investigation

1. **On Circularity**:
   - How does the circular nature of Hegel's system affect our understanding of its truth claims?
   - Can a circular system be truly presuppositionless?
   - How does the circularity of the system relate to the specific dialectical movements within it?

2. **On Pure Being**:
   - What exactly does it mean for pure being to be "indeterminate immediacy"?
   - How can we think pure being without introducing determinations?
   - What is the relationship between pure being in the Logic and ordinary conceptions of existence?

3. **On Quality**:
   - How does quality as the first determination of being relate to our ordinary understanding of qualities?
   - What is the precise relationship between quality and determinateness?
   - How does the transition from quality to quantity occur?

4. **On the Being-Nothing Relationship**:
   - How can we understand the claim that being and nothing are both identical and different?
   - What exactly is the "directional sense" that distinguishes them?
   - How does their unity in becoming resolve their contradiction?

5. **On the Larger Project**:
   - How does the beginning of the Logic set the pattern for its entire development?
   - What implications does the being-nothing dialectic have for Hegel's understanding of contradiction in general?
   - How does the Logic's beginning relate to its end in the Absolute Idea?
