## Integration with Course Themes
| Theme | Current Text Evidence | Previous Course Reference | Interpretive Connection |
|-------|----------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Systematic Philosophy | First actual shape shows systematic development | Introduction's emphasis on system | Shows necessity of development |

| Necessity of System | Internal development of consciousness | Why philosophy must be systematic | Demonstrates systematic nature |

## Personal Reflections
Initial framework established from Introduction will be tested in this first actual shape of consciousness. Particularly interested in seeing how the methodological principles work in practice.

## Next Steps
1. Read assigned text carefully with focus on:
   - Initial claims of sense-certainty
   - Structure of its experience
   - Movement to next shape
2. Apply methodological insights from Introduction
3. Track relationship between particular and universal
4. Note connections to broader systematic goals
