# Essay Outline: Why Hegel Claims Both That Being Is Nothing and Being Is Not Nothing

## Introduction
- Introduce the paradoxical claim in Hegel's Science of Logic that Being is Nothing and Being is not Nothing
- Briefly situate this claim within Hegel's larger project in the Science of Logic
- Thesis statement: Hegel's seemingly contradictory claims about Being and Nothing are not logical errors but the first instance of the dialectical movement that drives his entire logical system, revealing that pure indeterminacy is unstable and must give way to determination

## I. Hegel's Project in the Science of Logic and Its Rules

### A. The Science of Logic as a science of pure thinking
- Logic investigates the conditions of possibility for any determinate thought
- Logic is not merely formal but also metaphysical - it studies "the forms without which a thing could not be intelligible as what it is"
- Key quotation from Pippin: "The Science of Logic is the science of pure thinking. Pure thinking's object is itself, what it is to be thinking (where this must also include, at an a priori level, what it is for thought to have objects at all), and is pure in the sense that it is not aided by empirical experience."

### B. The rules Hegel's Logic obeys
- Must begin without substantial presuppositions about the content of thought
- Can only rely on what emerges from the immanent development of thought itself
- Must be self-determining, not guided by external criteria
- Key quotation from Hegel: "But if no presupposition is to be made, if the beginning is itself to be taken immediately, then the only determination of this beginning is that it is to be the beginning of logic, of thought as such. There is only present the resolve, which can also be viewed as arbitrary, of considering thinking as such." (SL 21.56)

## II. Why Hegel Begins with Being

### A. Being as the most minimal starting point
- Being is the most minimal, indeterminate concept possible - the thought of anything at all
- This starting point follows from the requirement of presuppositionlessness
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Being, pure being â€“ without further determination." (SL 59)

### B. The historical context of beginning with Being
- Connection to Parmenides and the beginning of Western metaphysics
- Hegel's response to the Parmenidean problem of how to think not-being
- Key quotation from Pippin: "We begin in effect at the beginning of philosophy, with 'Father Parmenides' and so with the beginning of Western rationalism."

## III. What We're Talking About When We Talk About 'Being' and 'Nothing'

### A. Concepts, not entities
- Being and Nothing are concepts or thought-determinations (Denkbestimmungen), not entities
- They are moments in the development of pure thinking, not objects of empirical experience
- Key quotation from Pippin: "The forms of thought studied by philosophy are the forms without which a thing could not be intelligible as what it is."

### B. The apperceptive character of these concepts
- Being and Nothing are moments in the self-determination of thought
- They reflect the apperceptive character of judgment - thought's relation to itself
- Key quotation from Pippin: "The apperceptive character of judging is what accounts for this characterization of the judging act itself as having the status of something inherently 'negative' as well as positive."

## IV. What Being and Nothing Are

### A. Being as pure, indeterminate immediacy
- Being is the thought of anything at all in its immediate indeterminacy
- It lacks any determination that would make it something specific
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Being is the indeterminate immediate." (SL 59)

### B. Nothing as the absence of all determination
- Nothing is not a separate entity but the same indeterminacy viewed from a different perspective
- It is the absence of all determination, just as Being is
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Nothing, pure nothing: it is simply equality with itself, complete emptiness, absence of all determination and content." (SL 59)

## V. How Hegel 'Gets From' Being to Nothing

### A. The failure of the attempt to think pure Being
- The attempt to think pure, indeterminate Being fails because there is nothing determinate to think
- This failure itself reveals that Being is Nothing
- Key quotation from Pippin: "The thought of anything at all in its immediate indeterminacy is not the thought of anything; the object of such thought is nothing."

### B. Not a temporal or deductive process
- The movement from Being to Nothing is not temporal or deductive
- It is a reflection on what happens when we try to think pure Being
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same." (SL 59)

## VI. Why Being Is Nothing and Why Being Is Not Nothing

### A. Why Being is Nothing
- Both are completely indeterminate - there is no content to distinguish them
- As pure indeterminacy, Being lacks any determination that would differentiate it from Nothing
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same." (SL 59)

### B. Why Being is not Nothing
- They are different moments or perspectives on indeterminacy
- Being is positive indeterminacy, Nothing is negative indeterminacy
- Key quotation from Hegel: "But the truth is just as much that they are not without distinction; it is rather that they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable, and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite." (SL 60)

### C. The unity of identity and difference in Becoming
- The contradiction between Being and Nothing resolves itself into Becoming
- Becoming is the first concrete category of the Logic
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Their truth is therefore this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming, a movement in which the two are distinguished, but by a distinction which has just as immediately dissolved itself." (SL 60)

## VII. The Role of This Contradiction in the Larger Project of the Science of Logic

### A. The dialectical movement of the Logic
- The contradiction between Being and Nothing is the first instance of the dialectical movement
- This pattern of contradiction and resolution continues throughout the Logic
- Key quotation from Pippin: "What is self-contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into abstract nothingness, but essentially only into the negation of its particular content."

### B. The necessity of contradiction for development
- Contradiction is not a logical error but the engine of conceptual development
- It reveals the inadequacy of each category and drives the movement to more adequate ones
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Something is therefore alive only insofar as it contains contradiction within itself, and is that force which can both comprehend and endure contradiction." (SL 439)

## Conclusion
- Summarize why Hegel claims both that Being is Nothing and Being is not Nothing
- Emphasize that this contradiction is not a logical error but the first instance of the dialectical movement
- Reflect on the significance of this contradiction for understanding Hegel's philosophical method
- Final thought: Hegel's treatment of Being and Nothing reveals that pure indeterminacy is unstable and must give way to determination, setting the pattern for the development of all the categories that follow
