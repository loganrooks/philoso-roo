## Overview

This analysis examines Martin Heidegger's confrontation with Hegel's concept of negativity, focusing particularly on the relationship between being, nothing, and negativity in Hegel's Logic. Heidegger's approach represents a fundamental questioning of Hegel's understanding of negativity and nothing, revealing what Heidegger sees as the unquestioned presuppositions of Hegel's system and Western metaphysics more broadly. This analysis is particularly relevant for understanding the beginning of Hegel's Science of Logic, where being and nothing are presented as identical yet different.

## Key Concepts in Heidegger's Analysis

### 1. The Questionlessness of Negativity in Hegel

Heidegger argues that negativity in Hegel's system is fundamentally "questionless" - its origin and essential structure are not treated as questionworthy:

> "Hegel's negativity is not a question for him; the 'origin,' and that means at the same time: the essential structure of that which this term comprises, does not become questionworthy and questionable because negativity is already posited with the 'domain' of its inquiry that is presupposed by it—posited with thinking: 'I represent something in general'—in its 'concept,' in its 'thoughtness,' as the thought."

For Heidegger, this questionlessness stems from the fact that negativity is already presupposed in Hegel's understanding of thinking itself. Negativity is the "energy" of unconditioned thinking, the essence of absolute subjectivity. Specifically, Heidegger identifies Hegel's negativity as "the threefold difference of immediate, mediated, unconditioned consciousness."

### 2. Hegel's Concept of Being and Nothing

Heidegger examines Hegel's understanding of being as "indeterminacy and immediacy." He notes that for Hegel, being and nothing are the same precisely because both are completely indeterminate and immediate:

> "Being 'is' also not a being and 'is' never a being; it is therefore the un-determined and un-mediated. Being conceived of as beingness is indeterminacy and immediacy."

Heidegger argues that Hegel's understanding of being is derived from a "dismantling" of absolute actuality - being is the "most unconditioned and the pure other of absolute actuality." This means that being is not differentiated from nothing in Hegel's system because both are equally indeterminate.

### 3. The Ontological Difference

A crucial aspect of Heidegger's critique is his identification of what he calls the "ontological difference" - the difference between being and beings - which he argues is presupposed but not questioned in Hegel's system:

> "This renunciation of the all-grounding difference expresses itself in Hegel's claim that the distinction between being and nothing is none. But this grounding difference is what in Being and Time we called 'ontological difference.'"

Heidegger suggests that Hegel's system depends on a "renunciation" of this fundamental difference, which allows for the unconditioned thinking of absolute idealism but leaves unquestioned the relationship between being and beings.

### 4. The Nothing as A-byss

In contrast to Hegel's understanding of nothing as mere indeterminacy, Heidegger proposes a more radical understanding of the nothing as the "a-byss" (Ab-grund):

> "The nothing as the a-byss, beyng itself. But here beyng not in a metaphysical sense, not in orientation toward and from beings, but from out of its truth."

For Heidegger, the nothing is not simply the negation of beings or the absence of determination, but rather the "abyssal counterpart" to beings, the "heaviest thing" that makes possible the clearing (Lichtung) in which beings can appear. The nothing "nihilates" - it makes room for beings to be by refusing to be a ground in the traditional sense.

### 5. Hegel's Negativity as Not Truly Negative

Heidegger argues that Hegel's negativity is not truly negative because it never takes the "not" and the "nihilating" seriously:

> "Hegel's negativity is not a negativity because it never takes seriously the not and the nihilating,—it has already sublated the not into the 'yes.'"

In Hegel's system, negativity is always already incorporated into the positive movement of the absolute idea. The negative is always already on its way to being sublated (aufgehoben) into a higher unity. For Heidegger, this means that Hegel never truly confronts the nothing in its nihilating power.

## Heidegger's Alternative Approach

### 1. Beyng and Nothing as "Fundamentally Different"

In contrast to Hegel's identification of being and nothing, Heidegger proposes that "beyng" (Seyn, his archaic spelling to distinguish his concept from traditional metaphysical "being") and nothing are both "one and yet 'fundamentally' different":

> "Beyng 'is' the 'nothing,'—not because each is equally as undetermined and unmediated as the other, but because they are one and yet 'fundamentally' different! They are that which first opens up a 'decision.'"

This relationship is not one of identity through indeterminacy, but rather a more complex relationship where the nothing is the "essential occurrence of beyng itself as that which nihilates a-byssally-abyssfully."

### 2. The Clearing as the "Between"

Heidegger introduces the concept of the "clearing" (Lichtung) as the "between" or "in-between" that makes possible the representation of something as something:

> "This clearing cannot be explained from beings; it is the 'between' [Zwischen] and in-between [Inzwischen] (in the time-spatial sense of the originary time-space). The 'of,' 'as,' the 'in the light of' are not beings, they are nothing and yet not null and naught; on the contrary: they are totally 'important' [wichtig], of the heaviest weight [Gewicht], the proper heavyweight and the only thing in which everything that is a being as a being 'is.'"

This clearing is not a being itself, but rather the opening or space in which beings can appear as beings. It is the "a-byss as ground," the "nihilating counterpart to all that is."

### 3. Da-sein as Standing in the Clearing

Heidegger redefines the essence of human being as "Da-sein" - standing in the clearing:

> "Standing in the clearing—man is in the ground of Da-sein. But insistence originarily: mood."

This standing in the clearing is not a property of human beings but rather the "essential ground" for human beings. It is a way of being that is characterized by an openness to the truth of beyng and a recognition of the nihilating power of the nothing.

## Implications for Understanding Hegel's Logic

### 1. The Beginning of the Logic Reconsidered

Heidegger's analysis suggests that the beginning of Hegel's Logic with pure being and nothing needs to be reconsidered in light of the unquestioned presuppositions that make this beginning possible. The identity of being and nothing in Hegel is not simply a matter of their shared indeterminacy, but rather depends on a specific understanding of being as the beingness of beings that remains unquestioned.

### 2. The Role of Negativity in Dialectical Movement

Heidegger's critique also challenges the understanding of negativity as the driving force of dialectical movement in Hegel's system. For Heidegger, Hegel's negativity is always already incorporated into the positive movement of the absolute idea, which means that it never truly confronts the nihilating power of the nothing.

### 3. The Question of the Origin of Negativity

Perhaps most importantly, Heidegger raises the question of the origin of negativity, which he argues remains unasked in Hegel's system:

> "Where is the origin of negativity? Where can it be grasped in the purest form? In the beginning? In being and nothing? But that is not a difference."

This question points to what Heidegger sees as the fundamental limitation of Hegel's system: its inability to question the origin of the negativity that drives its dialectical movement.

## Critical Assessment

### Strengths of Heidegger's Analysis

1. **Depth of Questioning**: Heidegger's analysis goes beyond a mere critique of Hegel's system to question the fundamental presuppositions that make this system possible. This depth of questioning allows for a more radical confrontation with Hegel's thought.

2. **Attention to the Unthought**: Heidegger's focus on what remains unthought or unquestioned in Hegel's system provides valuable insights into the limitations of Hegel's approach to negativity and nothing.

3. **Alternative Conceptualization**: Heidegger's alternative conceptualization of the nothing as the "a-byss" and the clearing as the "between" offers a rich framework for thinking about the relationship between being and nothing beyond the confines of traditional metaphysics.

### Limitations and Questions

1. **Interpretive Liberties**: Heidegger's reading of Hegel sometimes takes significant interpretive liberties, reading Hegel through the lens of his own philosophical project. This raises questions about the accuracy of his interpretation.

2. **Historical Context**: Heidegger's analysis sometimes neglects the historical context of Hegel's thought, particularly its relationship to Kant and German Idealism more broadly.

3. **Positive Aspects of Hegel's Negativity**: In focusing on what he sees as the limitations of Hegel's concept of negativity, Heidegger may underappreciate the positive aspects of Hegel's approach, particularly its ability to think through the productive role of negation in conceptual development.

## Relevance for Essay 1

Heidegger's analysis of negativity, nothing, and being in Hegel provides several important insights for Essay 1:

1. It highlights the importance of questioning the presuppositions that underlie Hegel's beginning with pure being and nothing in the Science of Logic.

2. It offers an alternative framework for thinking about the relationship between being and nothing that goes beyond their mere identity through indeterminacy.

3. It raises important questions about the origin and nature of negativity in Hegel's system, which could be fruitfully explored in an essay on the role of negativity in Hegel's Logic.

4. It provides a critical perspective on Hegel's understanding of dialectical movement, which could be used to develop a more nuanced account of how this movement works in the Logic.

## Conclusion

Heidegger's confrontation with Hegel's concept of negativity represents a fundamental questioning of the presuppositions that underlie Hegel's system and Western metaphysics more broadly. By focusing on what remains unquestioned in Hegel's approach to negativity and nothing, Heidegger opens up new possibilities for thinking about the relationship between being and nothing beyond the confines of traditional metaphysics. His analysis provides valuable insights for understanding the beginning of Hegel's Logic and the role of negativity in dialectical movement, while also raising important questions about the limitations of Hegel's approach.
