## Overview

This analysis examines Robert Pippin's interpretation of negation and the logic of being in Hegel's Science of Logic, focusing particularly on the relationship between being, nothing, and becoming at the beginning of the Logic. Pippin's approach represents a sophisticated attempt to understand Hegel's project as a post-Kantian development of transcendental philosophy, one that takes seriously the apperceptive character of judgment and the discursive nature of thought. This analysis is particularly relevant for understanding the beginning of Hegel's Science of Logic and the role of negativity in Hegel's philosophical system.

## Key Concepts in Pippin's Analysis

### 1. The Manifold Senses of Negation

Pippin begins by acknowledging the complexity and variety of ways in which Hegel invokes the concept of negation. He identifies five main contexts in which negation appears in Hegel's work:

1. **Thinking as Negating**: Hegel associates thinking itself with a kind of negating activity. This involves both the "negative" dimension of the judging act itself and the idea that any act of determination (or predication) should be understood as a kind of negating.

2. **Negation and Freedom**: Hegel links "the power of the negative" with freedom, suggesting that negativity is essential to understanding human agency and self-determination.

3. **Contrastive Determination**: The determinate content of any concept is primarily intelligible contrastively, in its negative relation with what it is not. This is the crux of Hegel's understanding of determination.

4. **Negation and Speculative Truth**: Negation plays a crucial role in Hegel's understanding of speculative truth, which is not about a concept's agreement with reality but its "agreeing with itself."

5. **Negation and Contradiction**: Hegel's controversial claim that "everything is inherently contradictory" relates to his understanding of negation as a real feature of the world, not merely a logical operator.

Pippin emphasizes that Hegel's concept of negation is not reducible to formal logical negation (the operation of negating a predicate or proposition). Rather, it involves a more complex understanding of how determination works through contrast and opposition.

### 2. The Apperceptive Character of Judgment

A central aspect of Pippin's interpretation is his emphasis on the apperceptive character of judgment in Hegel's logic. Drawing on Kant, Pippin argues that for Hegel, any judgment entails the exclusion of the possibility of many other judgments being true, and this is an aspect of self-conscious judging, a logical element of the judgment as a whole:

> "The apperceptive character of judging is what accounts for this characterization of the judging act itself as having the status of something inherently 'negative' as well as positive."

This apperceptive dimension means that in making a judgment, I am always also implicitly holding open the possibility of the self-correction of judging. Any judgment always implicitly applies the concept of judgment to itself. This self-relation is constitutive of judgment as such.

### 3. The Beginning of the Logic: Being, Nothing, Becoming

Pippin offers a detailed interpretation of the opening moves of Hegel's Logic, where pure being is shown to be identical with nothing, leading to the concept of becoming. He argues that this movement should be understood in terms of the failure of the attempt to think pure, indeterminate being:

> "We begin with an attempt to assume nothing about determinacy and determinations. The idea is to begin with the thought of anything at all, in its immediate indeterminacy, simply being, Sein. But the thought of anything at all in its immediate indeterminacy is not the thought of anything; the object of such thought is nothing, Nichts."

For Pippin, this is not a strange metaphysical claim about being and nothing as objects, but rather a reflection on the conditions of thinking itself. The attempted thought of immediate indeterminacy fails, and this failure is itself the beginning of the Logic's movement. The reflective relation to what is being thought is inseparable from anything possibly being thought - this is thought's apperceptive moment.

### 4. The "Given" as a Logical Problem

Pippin interprets the beginning of the Logic as addressing what he calls "the 'given' as a logical problem." This is the problem of how to understand the possibility of immediate, non-conceptual content in knowledge. Hegel's treatment of pure being can be seen as a logical version of the critique of the "myth of the given" that appears in the Phenomenology of Spirit:

> "There is an extended apagogic argument in the first three chapters of Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit that is meant to show the impossibility of any model of experiential knowledge that is understood to be based on a foundation that consists simply in the direct sensory presence of the world to the mind..."

At the logical level, this becomes the problem of how to understand the conceptual possibility of "mediated immediacy" - a notion that is paradoxical in its very formulation. If any immediacy is mediated, then it is not immediate. Yet Hegel insists that immediacy and mediation are "unseparated and inseparable."

### 5. Mediated Immediacy

The concept of "mediated immediacy" is central to Pippin's interpretation of Hegel's logic of being. This paradoxical notion refers to the way in which any supposedly immediate content is always already conceptually mediated, yet this mediation does not eliminate the moment of immediacy:

> "Immediacy of knowledge is so far from excluding mediation, that the two things are linked together—immediate knowledge being actually the product and result of mediated knowledge."

Pippin argues that this is not a temporal process where something is first immediate and then becomes mediated. Rather, immediacy and mediation are two inseparable moments of a single whole. He draws on Hegel's discussion of Kant's distinction between reflective and determining judgment to illustrate this point:

> "For any reflective judgment, the 'ascending' search for a universal cannot begin unless the particular is already determinate enough (and that must mean conceptually determinate) for the 'search' to have a determinate direction, or, really, any direction. And any subsuming, determining judgment cannot 'apply' the concept unless the particular has already been apprehended in a way that 'called for' the relevant concept, unless a moment of reflecting judgment has already occurred."

### 6. The Insufficiency of the Logic of Being

Pippin emphasizes that the logic of being ultimately proves insufficient for understanding the determinacy of being. The problem is what Hegel calls "indifference" (Gleichgültigkeit) - the indifference of the subject of predicates to the predicates themselves:

> "A mere list of contingent properties and quantitative measures cannot sufficiently count as having determined any subject of those determinations as such."

This insufficiency leads to the transition to the logic of essence, where the relationship between a thing and its properties is reconceived in terms of essence and appearance. The logic of being cannot account for the difference between essential and accidental predicates, and so cannot explain what makes a thing the determinate thing it is.

## Pippin's Approach to Hegel's Logic

### 1. Post-Kantian Transcendental Philosophy

Pippin interprets Hegel's Logic as a post-Kantian development of transcendental philosophy. He emphasizes that Hegel accepts Kant's insight that thinking is discursive, not intuitive - it is not a kind of perceiving or primarily receptive. However, Hegel goes beyond Kant by questioning the strict separation between intuition and concept:

> "Without some dissolving of what Hegel called the typically metaphysical or Verstand-typical either/or of receptive but blind intuition and active but empty thinking, we will not be able to explain the simplest case of concept application."

For Pippin, Hegel's Logic is an attempt to show how pure thinking can determine its own moments or forms, not by conceptualizing an alien content, but through a self-relation that determines a content.

### 2. Logic as Metaphysics

Pippin emphasizes that for Hegel, logic properly understood is metaphysics. The forms of thought studied by philosophy are the forms without which a thing could not be intelligible as what it is:

> "The forms of thought studied by philosophy are the forms without which a thing could not be intelligible as what it is (where what it is is a determinate something). We study the intelligibility of what there is by studying judgmental, essentially predicative form."

This means that the Logic's subject matter is not merely subjective forms of thinking, but the modalities of sense-making that are constitutive of any possible sense. Hegel returns to Aristotle's treatment of logic as a kind of metaphysics, but without the commitments of rationalist dogmatism.

### 3. The Discursive Nature of Thought

A key aspect of Pippin's interpretation is his emphasis on the discursive nature of thought in Hegel. He argues that Hegel accepts Kant's insight that thinking is discursive, not intuitive, but develops this insight in a new direction:

> "Thinking is a productive power, spontaneity. The categorical structure of being is not simply noetically available to, transparent to, the light of reason."

This means that pure thinking determines its own possibility, and this with respect to the possibility of thinking any determinate object. The beginning of the Logic shows the essential discursivity of thought - the attempt to think being as such fails, revealing that any thinking must be the attempt to think that being as such is X or Y or whatever.

## Critical Assessment

### Strengths of Pippin's Analysis

1. **Kantian Context**: Pippin's emphasis on the Kantian background of Hegel's thought helps to situate the Logic within the broader context of German Idealism and to highlight the ways in which Hegel both builds on and transforms Kant's insights.

2. **Apperceptive Dimension**: By focusing on the apperceptive character of judgment, Pippin provides a compelling account of why negation is so central to Hegel's logic and how it relates to the self-conscious nature of thought.

3. **Logical Movement**: Pippin offers a sophisticated account of the "movement" of Hegel's Logic that avoids both mystical interpretations and reductions to formal logic, emphasizing instead the self-determining character of conceptual content.

4. **Mediated Immediacy**: His treatment of the paradoxical notion of "mediated immediacy" helps to clarify one of the most difficult aspects of Hegel's thought and shows how it relates to broader issues in epistemology and metaphysics.

### Limitations and Questions

1. **Emphasis on Apperception**: While Pippin's emphasis on apperception is illuminating, it may not fully capture the ontological dimension of Hegel's project. There is a risk of reducing Hegel's logic to a theory of judgment or conceptual content.

2. **Relation to Metaphysics**: Although Pippin emphasizes that logic is metaphysics for Hegel, his interpretation sometimes seems to downplay the more robust metaphysical claims that Hegel makes, particularly regarding the reality of contradiction.

3. **Historical Context**: Pippin's focus on the Kantian background sometimes comes at the expense of other important influences on Hegel, such as Spinoza, Aristotle, and the broader tradition of German mysticism.

4. **Relation to Other Interpretations**: Pippin's interpretation stands in tension with other prominent readings of Hegel, such as those that emphasize the metaphysical or ontological dimensions of his thought. It would be helpful to see more explicit engagement with these alternative interpretations.

## Relevance for Essay 1

Pippin's analysis of negation and the logic of being in Hegel provides several important insights for Essay 1:

1. It offers a sophisticated account of the beginning of Hegel's Logic that emphasizes the apperceptive character of judgment and the discursive nature of thought, which can help to clarify the relationship between being and nothing.

2. It highlights the importance of understanding negation not merely as a logical operator but as a constitutive feature of conceptual determination, which is essential for grasping Hegel's dialectical method.

3. It provides a compelling interpretation of the transition from being to essence that can help to situate the discussion of being and nothing within the broader context of Hegel's Logic.

4. It offers a way of understanding the paradoxical notion of "mediated immediacy" that is central to Hegel's account of becoming, the first concrete category of the Logic.

## Comparison with Heidegger's Approach

Pippin's interpretation of Hegel's logic of being and the role of negation differs significantly from Heidegger's approach:

1. **Apperception vs. Beyng**: While Pippin emphasizes the apperceptive character of judgment and the discursive nature of thought, Heidegger focuses on the question of beyng (Seyn) and the ontological difference between being and beings. For Heidegger, the nothing is the "a-byss" (Ab-grund) of beyng itself, not merely a moment in the self-determination of thought.

2. **Transcendental vs. Ontological**: Pippin interprets Hegel's Logic as a post-Kantian development of transcendental philosophy, while Heidegger sees it as the culmination of Western metaphysics, which he seeks to overcome through a more radical questioning of the meaning of being.

3. **Discursivity vs. Clearing**: For Pippin, the beginning of the Logic reveals the essential discursivity of thought, while for Heidegger, it points to the "clearing" (Lichtung) in which beings can appear as beings, a clearing that is not reducible to conceptual determination.

4. **Negation vs. Nihilation**: Pippin understands negation primarily in terms of conceptual determination and the apperceptive character of judgment, while Heidegger distinguishes between negation as a logical operation and "nihilation" (Nichtung) as the essential occurrence of beyng itself.

Despite these differences, both Pippin and Heidegger offer valuable perspectives on Hegel's logic of being and the role of negation in his thought. Their interpretations can be seen as complementary rather than mutually exclusive, highlighting different aspects of Hegel's complex philosophical project.

## Conclusion

Pippin's analysis of negation and the logic of being in Hegel offers a sophisticated interpretation that emphasizes the apperceptive character of judgment, the discursive nature of thought, and the post-Kantian context of Hegel's project. By focusing on the problem of "mediated immediacy" and the insufficiency of the logic of being, Pippin provides valuable insights into the beginning of Hegel's Logic and the role of negativity in his philosophical system. While his interpretation may not fully capture the ontological dimension of Hegel's thought, it offers a compelling account of the logical movement from being to essence and the centrality of negation in Hegel's dialectical method.
