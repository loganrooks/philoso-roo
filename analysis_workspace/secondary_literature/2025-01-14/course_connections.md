# Course Connections: From Sense-Certainty to Logic
Date: March 6, 2025
Target Course Date: January 14, 2025

## 1. Immediate Key Connections

### A. The Problem of Beginning
1. In Sense-Certainty:
   - Begins with immediate knowing
   - "This" as pure immediacy
   - Breakdown of immediate presence

2. In Science of Logic:
   - Pure being as beginning
   - Immediacy without presupposition
   - Movement to nothing/becoming

3. Parallel Structure:
   - Both start with pure immediacy
   - Both show immediacy's self-negation
   - Both reveal mediation's necessity

### B. The Role of Negation
1. In Sense-Certainty:
   - Now negates its content
   - This becomes not-this
   - Universal emerges through negation

2. In Logic:
   - Being passes into nothing
   - Determinate being contains negation
   - Quality emerges through limitation

### C. Language and Truth
1. In Sense-Certainty:
   - Language speaks universal
   - Cannot express pure particular
   - Truth in universal expression

2. In Logic:
   - Pure being unsayable
   - Determinacy through negation
   - Thought = being in truth

## 2. Specific Textual Connections

### A. From PhS §97 to SL Being
1. PhS: "What we say is: 'This', i.e. the universal This"
   - Shows universality in language
   - Reveals mediation in immediacy
   - Points to logical structure

2. SL: "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same"
   - Shows same structure at logical level
   - Reveals necessity of mediation
   - Develops systematic implications

### B. Movement Structure
1. In Sense-Certainty:
   - This → Not-this → Universal
   - Now → Not-now → Permanent now
   - Immediate → Mediated → True universal

2. In Logic:
   - Being → Nothing → Becoming
   - Immediate → Negation → Determinate being
   - Abstract → Mediated → Concrete

## 3. Methodological Insights

### A. Role of Beginning
1. Why Start Here?
   - Phenomenology: Most immediate knowledge
   - Logic: Most immediate thought
   - Both: Necessity of beginning

2. How Does It Move?
   - Through internal contradiction
   - Via necessary development
   - Toward greater determinacy

### B. Nature of Development
1. In Phenomenology:
   - Through experience
   - Via consciousness's learning
   - Toward absolute knowing

2. In Logic:
   - Through thought's self-movement
   - Via conceptual necessity
   - Toward absolute idea

## 4. Reading Strategy Applications

### A. For Current Reading (Sense-Certainty)
1. Track Terms:
   - Being/is
   - Negation/not
   - Universal/particular

2. Note Movements:
   - From immediate to mediated
   - From particular to universal
   - From abstract to concrete

### B. For Upcoming Logic Readings
1. Look For:
   - Similar structural moments
   - Parallel movements
   - Systematic connections

2. Questions to Ask:
   - How does beginning work here?
   - What role does negation play?
   - How does truth emerge?

## 5. Discussion Questions

### A. Methodological
1. Why must both texts begin with immediacy?
2. How do their movements differ?
3. What makes their developments necessary?

### B. Substantive
1. What is the relationship between:
   - Phenomenological and logical beginning?
   - Experience and conceptual development?
   - Truth in consciousness and truth in thought?

### C. Systematic
1. How do these texts:
   - Relate to each other?
   - Build on each other?
   - Complete each other?

## 6. Next Steps

### A. For Sense-Certainty
1. Complete analysis of:
   - Movement to perception
   - Role of universality
   - Nature of experience

### B. For Logic
1. Prepare to examine:
   - Pure being
   - Role of nothing
   - Nature of becoming

### C. For Integration
1. Track connections between:
   - Types of movement
   - Forms of necessity
   - Modes of truth
