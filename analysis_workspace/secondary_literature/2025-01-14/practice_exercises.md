Target Course Date: January 14, 2025

## 1. Phenomenology Exercises

### A. Tracking Consciousness's Experience
Exercise 1: The This (ยง95)
1. First, identify:
   - Initial claim: "Now is Night"
   - What consciousness thinks it knows
   - How it thinks it knows it

2. Then track:
   - How the claim is tested
   - What actually happens
   - What consciousness learns

3. Finally analyze:
   - Why the experience was necessary
   - What truth emerges
   - How this leads forward

### B. Mapping "We" Perspective
Exercise 2: The Universal (ยง96-97)
1. Mark every instance of:
   - "We" statements
   - What "we" see
   - What "we" learn

2. Compare with:
   - What consciousness sees
   - What consciousness learns
   - The gap between them

3. Analyze:
   - Why "we" see more
   - How this structures experience
   - What this reveals about method

## 2. Logic Exercises

### A. Following Pure Thought
Exercise 1: Pure Being
1. First, isolate:
   - The pure thought content
   - Its internal structure
   - Its self-relation

2. Then track:
   - How it develops internally
   - What necessitates movement
   - Where it leads

3. Finally analyze:
   - Why this movement is necessary
   - What truth emerges
   - How system develops

### B. Tracking Conceptual Movement
Exercise 2: Being-Nothing-Becoming
1. Map the movement:
   - From pure being
   - Through nothing
   - To becoming

2. Identify:
   - Each moment's structure
   - Their relations
   - Their unity

3. Analyze:
   - Why this order
   - What makes it necessary
   - How it grounds further development

## 3. Integration Exercises

### A. Comparative Analysis
Exercise 1: Immediacy in Both Texts
1. Compare treatment of immediacy:
   - In sense-certainty
   - In pure being
   - Note structural parallels

2. Analyze differences:
   - In method
   - In development
   - In result

3. Consider:
   - Why these differences
   - What they reveal
   - How they relate

### B. Movement Patterns
Exercise 2: Negation's Role
1. Track negation:
   - In phenomenological experience
   - In logical development
   - Note functional similarities

2. Compare:
   - How negation works
   - What it produces
   - Why it's necessary

3. Analyze:
   - Methodological differences
   - Systematic connections
   - Unity in difference

## 4. Writing Exercises

1. Structure:
   - Initial situation

   - Result

2. Include:
   - Specific quotes
   - Movement analysis
   - Systematic significance

3. Explain:
   - Why this movement
   - How it works
   - What it shows

### B. Logic Analysis
Exercise: Write a 1-page analysis of Pure Being
1. Structure:
   - Initial determination
   - Internal development
   - Systematic result

2. Include:
   - Key concepts
   - Necessary relations
   - Systematic connections

3. Explain:
   - Movement's necessity
   - Truth's emergence
   - Systematic role

## 5. Discussion Preparation

### A. Phenomenology Questions
1. For each section:
   - What does consciousness claim?
   - How is this tested?
   - What is learned?

2. Prepare:
   - Key quotes
   - Movement analysis
   - Systematic points

### B. Logic Questions
1. For each moment:
   - What is the thought content?
   - How does it develop?
   - What makes this necessary?

2. Prepare:
   - Conceptual analysis
   - Movement structure
   - Systematic connections
