Target Course Date: January 14, 2025

## 1. Common Difficulties in Phenomenology

### A. The "We" Perspective
Problem: Confusion about role of "we" vs. consciousness

Solution Strategy:
1. Mark Every "We":
   ```
   CONSCIOUSNESS | "WE"
   Makes claim   | Observe claim
   Tests truth   | See testing
   Learns       | Record learning
   ```

2. Track Two Levels:
   ```
   Natural consciousness: experiences
   "We": observe & record
   ```

3. Key Question:
   - Who is speaking/acting here?
   - What is their role?
   - Why this perspective?

### B. Experience Structure
Problem: Unclear how experience leads to truth

Solution Strategy:
1. Map Movement:
   ```
   Claim → Test → Failure → Learning
   ```

2. Track Each Moment:
   - What's claimed?
   - How tested?
   - Why fails?
   - What's learned?

3. Show Necessity:
   - Why this step?
   - Why this order?
   - Why this result?

## 2. Common Difficulties in Logic

### A. Pure Thought Content
Problem: Keeping thought pure/avoiding representations

Solution Strategy:
1. Check for Pictures:
   ```
   NOT: Mental images
   NOT: External references
   YES: Pure thought determination
   ```

2. Test Purity:
   - Is this pure thought?
   - Any external reference?
   - Any representation?

3. Stay with Thought:
   - What's thought here?
   - How develops internally?
   - Why necessary?

### B. Movement Structure
Problem: Understanding necessity of development

Solution Strategy:
1. Track Internal Relations:
   ```
   Content → Structure → Development
   ```

2. Show Necessity:
   - What makes movement?
   - Why this direction?
   - How determined?

3. Map Connections:
   - To previous
   - To next
   - To system

## 3. Integration Problems

### A. Method Relations
Problem: How methods relate/differ

Solution Strategy:
1. Compare Approaches:
   ```
   Phenomenology | Logic
   Experience    | Thought
   Testing      | Development
   Learning     | Necessity
   ```

2. Show Complementarity:
   - Different aspects
   - Same truth
   - Unity in system

3. Map Relations:
   - How connect?
   - Why both?
   - What unified?

### B. System Questions
Problem: Understanding systematic unity

Solution Strategy:
1. Track Levels:
   ```
   Experience level
   Thought level
   System level
   ```

2. Show Connections:
   - Between levels
   - Within levels
   - To whole

3. Map Unity:
   - How unified?
   - Why necessary?
   - What achieved?

## 4. Specific Trouble Spots

### A. Phenomenology §97
Problem: Language's role in truth

Strategy:
1. Track Language:
   - What's said
   - What's meant
   - What's true

2. Show Movement:
   - From intention
   - Through language
   - To truth

3. Map Function:
   - Why language?
   - How works?
   - What reveals?

### B. Logic's Beginning
Problem: Pure being's emptiness

Strategy:
1. Think Purely:
   - No determination
   - Pure immediacy
   - Complete abstraction

2. Follow Movement:
   - Why empty?
   - How nothing?
   - Why becoming?

3. Show Necessity:
   - Of beginning
   - Of development
   - Of result

## 5. Working Through Difficulties

### A. General Approach
1. Identify Problem:
   - What's unclear?
   - Why difficult?
   - What needed?

2. Apply Method:
   - Right approach
   - Clear steps
   - Check results

3. Verify Understanding:
   - Can explain?
   - Shows necessity?
   - Fits system?

### B. Specific Steps
1. For Any Passage:
   - Identify type
   - Choose approach
   - Apply method
   - Check results

2. For Discussion:
   - Clear problem
   - Show approach
   - Demonstrate solution
   - Connect to whole
