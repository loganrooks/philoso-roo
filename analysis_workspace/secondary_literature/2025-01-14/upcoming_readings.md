## 1. Perception Chapter (Phenomenology)

### A. Entry Points
1. From Sense-Certainty:
   ```
   Universal already present
   Mediation established
   Language's role shown
   ```

2. New Elements:
   ```
   Thing/property relation
   Unity/multiplicity
   Deception/truth
   ```

### B. Reading Protocol
1. First Pass:
   ```
   CONSCIOUSNESS    | OUR VIEW
   Thing claims    | Unity problem
   Property claims | Multiplicity issue
   Truth claims    | Necessity shown
   ```

2. Track Development:
   ```
   Also/One
   Force/Expression
   Inner/Outer
   ```

3. Note Language:
   - How consciousness speaks
   - What terms emerge
   - Why these necessary

## 2. Being-Nothing-Becoming (Logic)

### A. Entry Points
1. From Sense-Certainty:
   ```
   Pure immediacy
   Internal development
   Systematic necessity
   ```

2. New Elements:
   ```
   Pure thought
   Self-movement
   Determinate being
   ```

### B. Reading Protocol
1. First Pass:
   ```
   THOUGHT         | DEVELOPMENT
   Pure being     | Complete emptiness
   Nothing        | Same emptiness
   Becoming      | First concrete
   ```

2. Track Movement:
   ```
   Being → Nothing
   Nothing → Being
   Both → Becoming
   ```

3. Note Necessity:
   - Why this order
   - How develops
   - What achieved

## 3. Integration Strategy

### A. Parallel Structures
1. Track Both:
   ```
   Phenomenology        | Logic
   Thing/properties    | Being/nothing
   Unity/multiplicity | Identity/difference
   Truth emergence    | Becoming
   ```

2. Note Methods:
   ```
   Experience-based    | Thought-based
   Through testing    | Through development
   To truth          | To system
   ```

### B. Connection Points
1. Key Moments:
   ```
   Universal nature
   Mediation necessity
   Truth development
   ```

2. System Relations:
   ```
   Different approaches
   Same truth
   One system
   ```

## 4. Specific Reading Tasks

### A. For Perception
1. Map Each Moment:
   - Initial claim
   - Testing process
   - Learning result

2. Track Terms:
   ```
   Thing → Properties
   One → Many
   Truth → Deception
   ```

3. Show Development:
   - Why this move
   - How necessary
   - What achieved

### B. For Logic
1. Think Each Moment:
   - Pure determination
   - Internal relations
   - Necessary movement

2. Track Categories:
   ```
   Being → Emptiness
   Nothing → Same
   Becoming → Concrete
   ```

3. Show Necessity:
   - Why this order
   - How develops
   - What grounds

## 5. Key Questions

### A. For Perception
1. About Method:
   - How does experience work here?
   - Why these tests?
   - What's learned?

2. About Content:
   - Why thing/properties?
   - How relate?
   - What truth?

### B. For Logic
1. About Method:
   - How think purely?
   - Why this movement?
   - What necessity?

2. About Content:
   - Why begin here?
   - How develop?
   - What achieved?

## 6. Discussion Preparation

### A. Core Points
1. Have Ready:
   - Key passages
   - Movement maps
   - System connections

2. Questions Prepared:
   - Method questions
   - Content issues
   - System relations

### B. Integration Points
1. Method Relations:
   ```
   How complement?
   Why both?
   What unified?
   ```

2. Truth Development:
   ```
   How emerges?
   Why necessary?
   What achieved?
   ```

   - Track movement
   - Show necessity
   - See connections

2. Do You:
