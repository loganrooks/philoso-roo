## Exercise 1.A: Analysis of ยง95

### 1. Initial Situation

#### A. Consciousness's Claim
Text: "What is Now? let us answer, e.g. 'Now is Night.'"

Components:
1. Knowledge Claimed:
   - Immediate awareness of Now
   - Specific content (Night)
   - Direct certainty

2. Form of Claim:
   - Simple assertion
   - Takes form "Now is X"
   - Claims immediate truth

3. Implicit Structure:
   - Subject (Now)
   - Predicate (Night)
   - Copula (is)

### 2. Testing Experience

#### A. Method of Testing
Text: "We write down this truth; a truth cannot lose anything by being written down, any more than it can lose anything through our preserving it."

1. Test Structure:
   - Physical writing
   - Preservation attempt
   - Time passage

2. Crucial Features:
   - External preservation
   - Temporal duration
   - Fixed content

#### B. What Actually Happens
Text: "If now, this noon, we look again at the written truth we shall have to say that it has become stale."

1. Result:
   - Written truth false
   - Content changed
   - Yet Now remains

2. Analysis:
   - Content contingent
   - Form persistent
   - Universal emerges

### 3. What Consciousness Learns

#### A. Immediate Result
Text: "The Now that is Night is preserved, i.e. it is treated as what it professes to be, as something that is; but it proves itself to be, on the contrary, something that is not."

1. Discovery:
   - Immediate claim false
   - Yet structure remains
   - Truth more complex

2. Structure Revealed:
   - Now persists through change
   - Content varies
   - Form universal

#### B. Deeper Truth
Text: "The Now does indeed preserve itself, but as something that is not Night..."

1. Philosophical Significance:
   - Immediacy mediated
   - Particular universal
   - Truth in form

2. Systematic Import:
   - Movement necessary
   - Experience educational
   - Truth developing

### 4. Analysis of Movement

#### A. Necessity
1. Why This Path:
   - Begins with immediate claim
   - Must test claim
   - Truth emerges through test

2. Structure Required:
   - Initial position
   - Testing experience
   - Result/learning

#### B. Systematic Role
1. In Phenomenology:
   - First shape of consciousness
   - Shows immediacy impossible
   - Leads to perception

2. For Method:
   - Shows experience structure
   - Reveals truth's emergence
   - Demonstrates necessity

### 5. Key Insights

#### A. About Experience
1. Structure:
   - Not just passive reception
   - Active testing required
   - Learning through failure

2. Movement:
   - From immediate to mediated
   - Through contradiction
   - Toward truth

#### B. About Truth
1. Nature:
   - Not immediate given
   - Emerges through experience
   - Universal in form

2. Development:
   - Through negation
   - Via preservation
   - Toward system

### 6. Discussion Points

#### A. Methodological
1. Why write down?
   - Tests immediacy
   - Shows temporality
   - Reveals mediation

2. Why this order?
   - Begins with claim
   - Tests through time
   - Reveals universal

#### B. Philosophical
1. Nature of truth:
   - Not immediate
   - Through experience
   - In universal

2. Role of time:
   - Tests claims
   - Shows change
   - Reveals permanence
