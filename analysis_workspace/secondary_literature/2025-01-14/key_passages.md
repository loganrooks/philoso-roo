# Key Passages: Logic and Sense-Certainty Compared
Date: March 6, 2025
Target Course Date: January 14, 2025

## 1. On Beginning

### A. Science of Logic
> "Being, pure being – without further determination... In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself... It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness... Being, the indeterminate immediate, is in fact nothing, and neither more nor less than nothing."

Compare with PhS §91:
> "All that it says about what it knows is just that it is; and its truth contains nothing but the sheer being of the thing."

#### Analysis Points:
1. Immediacy Structure:
   - Logic: Pure indeterminate being
   - PhS: Pure immediate knowing
   - Both: Emptiness of pure immediacy

2. Movement Necessity:
   - Logic: Being → Nothing
   - PhS: This → Not-this
   - Both: Immediate collapses

## 2. On Negation

### A. Science of Logic
> "Nothing, pure nothingness; it is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, complete absence of determination and content; undifferentiatedness in itself."

Compare with PhS §96:
> "The Now does indeed preserve itself, but as something that is not Night... as a negative in general."

#### Analysis Points:
1. Negation Structure:
   - Logic: Nothing as pure negation
   - PhS: This as self-negating
   - Both: Negativity essential

2. Preservation:
   - Logic: Through becoming
   - PhS: Through universality
   - Both: Through self-negation

## 3. On Movement

### A. Science of Logic
> "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same. The truth is neither being nor nothing, but rather that being has passed over into nothing and nothing into being – 'has passed over' is not the right expression here; rather being and nothing are always already outside themselves, they are becoming."

Compare with PhS §107:
> "The 'Now', and pointing out the 'Now', are thus so constituted that neither the one nor the other is something immediate and simple, but a movement which contains various moments."

#### Analysis Points:
1. Movement Structure:
   - Logic: Being ↔ Nothing → Becoming
   - PhS: This ↔ Not-this → Universal
   - Both: Through self-transcendence

2. Result:
   - Logic: Determinate being
   - PhS: Universal this
   - Both: Mediated immediacy

## 4. On Truth

### A. Science of Logic
> "The analysis of the beginning would thus yield the concept of the unity of being and nothing – or, in a more reflected form, the unity of differentiatedness and non-differentiatedness, or the identity of identity and non-identity."

Compare with PhS §97:
> "Language, as we see, is the more truthful; in it, we ourselves directly refute what we mean to say."

#### Analysis Points:
1. Truth Structure:
   - Logic: Unity through difference
   - PhS: Universal through particular
   - Both: Truth as self-showing

2. Method:
   - Logic: Conceptual development
   - PhS: Experiential learning
   - Both: Self-moving process

## 5. Specific Reading Protocol

### A. For Each Passage:
1. Map Components:
   - Initial position
   - Movement structure
   - Resulting truth

2. Track Terms:
   - Being/nothing
   - Immediate/mediate
   - Universal/particular

3. Note Relations:
   - To parallel text
   - To systematic whole
   - To philosophical tradition

### B. Key Questions:
1. How does the movement work?
   - Internal necessity
   - Structural parallels
   - Systematic role

2. What makes it necessary?
   - Logical grounds
   - Phenomenological grounds
   - Systematic grounds

3. What truth emerges?
   - Content
   - Form
   - Relation to whole

## 6. Integration Points

### A. For Discussion:
1. Is the movement the same in:
   - Logical development
   - Phenomenological experience

2. How do they relate to:
   - Each other
   - The system
   - Truth itself

### B. For Understanding:
1. What makes both:
   - Necessary
   - Complete
   - True

2. How do they:
   - Support each other
   - Differ from each other
   - Complete each other
