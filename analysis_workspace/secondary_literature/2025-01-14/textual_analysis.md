Date: March 6, 2025
Target Course Date: January 14, 2025

## 1. The "This" and Language (ยง97)

### Hegel's Text
> "It is as a universal too that we utter what the sensuous [content] is. What we say is: 'This', i.e. the universal This; or, 'it is', i.e. Being in general... language, as we see, is the more truthful; in it, we ourselves directly refute what we mean to say."

### Heidegger's Reading
- Focuses on "is" rather than This
- Connects to fundamental ontology
- Sees language as revealing being
- Links to broader question of logos

### Key Differences
1. **Focus**
   - Hegel: Dialectical movement to universal
   - Heidegger: Ontological significance of "is"

2. **Role of Language**
   - Hegel: Shows impossibility of pure particularity
   - Heidegger: Reveals being's self-showing

## 2. The Role of "We" (ยง109)

### Hegel's Text
> "That is why the natural consciousness, too, is always reaching this result, learning from experience what is true in it; but equally it is always forgetting it and starting the movement all over again."

### Heidegger's Reading
- Emphasizes absolvent character
- Sees repetition as ontological
- Connects to historical understanding
- Questions nature of experience

### Key Differences
1. **Nature of Experience**
   - Hegel: Educational development
   - Heidegger: Return to origins

2. **Role of Repetition**
   - Hegel: Failure of natural consciousness
   - Heidegger: Ontological structure

## 3. Pure Being (ยง91)

### Hegel's Text
> "All that it says about what it knows is just that it is; and its truth contains nothing but the sheer being of the thing [Sache]."

### Heidegger's Reading
- Connects to being-question
- Sees fundamental ontological significance
- Links to history of metaphysics
- Questions nature of presence

### Key Differences
1. **Status of Being**
   - Hegel: Moment in dialectical movement
   - Heidegger: Fundamental question

2. **Historical Significance**
   - Hegel: Stage in consciousness's development
   - Heidegger: Moment in history of being

   - Illuminate hidden dimensions?
   - Miss dialectical necessity?
   - Transform too radically?

2. How do these differences affect:
   - Understanding of method?
   - Nature of philosophical truth?
   - Role of history?
