## Key Methodological Insights from Jan 7

### Essential Concepts to Carry Forward
1. **Natural Consciousness**
   - Starting point that contains its own standard
   - Develops through internal contradiction
   - Will be directly observed in Sense-Certainty

2. **Experience (Erfahrung)**
   - Technical term for dialectical movement
   - Not mere empirical experience
   - Process where consciousness finds its conception incoherent

3. **For-Us vs For-Consciousness**
   - Essential methodological distinction
   - Will be crucial for analyzing Sense-Certainty
   - Guides observation of development

### Key Methods to Apply
1. **Immanent Critique**
   - Let consciousness test itself
   - Observe internal contradictions
   - Track how new shape emerges

2. **Determinate Negation**
   - Watch for positive content from negation
   - Track specific form of development
   - Note necessity of progression

## Preparation for Sense-Certainty Analysis

### Key Questions to Consider
1. How does Sense-Certainty exemplify natural consciousness?
2. What is its initial claim to truth?
3. How does it provide its own criterion?
4. What role does the for-us/for-consciousness distinction play?
5. How does determinate negation work in this specific case?

### Reading Focus Points
1. Pay attention to:
   - Initial claims of Sense-Certainty
   - Structure of its experience
   - Movement to next shape
   
2. Note carefully:
   - Role of deixis (this, here, now)
   - Universal vs particular
   - Relationship to method from Introduction

### Required Follow-up
1. Trace how methodological principles from Introduction apply
2. Document first actual example of dialectical movement
3. Track relationship between particular and universal
4. Note connections to broader systematic goals

## Concept Tracking

### Concepts to Monitor
1. Immediacy
2. Sensuous Certainty
3. Particularity/Universality
4. Truth Claims
5. Knowledge Forms

### Arguments to Track
1. Initial certainty claims
2. Self-refutation process
3. Movement to perception

## Next Steps
1. Review assigned reading for Sense-Certainty
2. Apply methodological framework established in Introduction
3. Prepare preliminary questions based on Jan 7 insights
4. Begin formal pre-lecture analysis

## Additional Notes
- This is our first encounter with an actual shape of consciousness
- Key test case for methodological principles
- Important transition from introduction to actual development
- Sets pattern for all subsequent shapes
