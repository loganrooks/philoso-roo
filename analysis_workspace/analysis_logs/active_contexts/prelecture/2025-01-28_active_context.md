## Analysis Notes
The pre-lecture analysis for January 28, 2025, has been completed. The analysis focused on the beginning of the Doctrine of Being in Hegel's Science of Logic, with special attention to:

1. The circular nature of Hegel's system, showing how "the first becomes also the last, and the last also the first"
2. The justification for beginning with pure being as "indeterminate immediacy"
3. The relationship between being and nothing, explaining why being both is and is not nothing
4. The nature of quality as the first determination of being

The analysis has provided positive and negative determinations for all key concepts, analyzed the specific passages identified in the handoff document, integrated insights from previous analyses and secondary literature, and connected the analysis to the essay prompt on Being and Nothing.
