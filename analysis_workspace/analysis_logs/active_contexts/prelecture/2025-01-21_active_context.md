## Analysis Notes
The pre-lecture analysis for January 21, 2025, has been completed. The analysis covers all assigned readings and integrates insights from:
1. The Jan 14 class analysis on Sensuous Certainty
2. Pippin's "Realm of Shadows" secondary literature
3. The connections between Phenomenology and Logic

The analysis demonstrates how the readings collectively show the transition from phenomenological investigation to logical investigation in Hegel's system. Key themes include:
- The resolution of the subject-object division in Absolute Knowing
- The problem of beginning in philosophy
- The identity of thought and being in Logic
- The emancipatory dimension of logical investigation
