1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
is the only possible justification for the logic being

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:13,440
the science of logic being also the science of being.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:15,440
The self-determining content of thought

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,440
is structurally identical to the self-determining content

5
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,960
of being.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,640
And so that's why Hegel says in the Encyclopedia,

7
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,320
paragraph 24, the logic coincides with metaphysics.

8
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,120
They have the same content.

9
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,520
Hegel's just told us that the deduction of that science,

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:40,280
the science that is both logic and metaphysics,

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,600
is the phenomenology of spirit itself.

12
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,520
And the phenomenology is, let's see, 500 pages?

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,480
500 pages, 466.

14
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,080
So that's a little disappointing,

15
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:55,200
because if you want to know why the science of logic

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,520
is actually a metaphysics, if you

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,320
want to see the deduction of this science

18
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,400
and its justification, you need to read

19
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,880
the whole phenomenology of spirit.

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,760
And every step in the phenomenology of spirit

21
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,520
needs to work.

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,240
But I think there's internal evidence.

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,660
That's why I assigned those passages

24
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:14,160
from the Encyclopedia.

25
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,280
There's internal evidence in the Encyclopedia

26
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,680
that Hegel thinks there's a shorter

27
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,280
argument to that conclusion.

28
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,720
Now, that is to say.

29
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,880
So what is the relationship between these two things?

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,000
I'm not sure what the relationship between these two

31
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,280
things is.

32
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:41,480
I think that the argument that I call the short argument

33
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:46,480
is sufficient to establish the logic

34
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,500
as being what the science of thinking

35
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,000
and the science of metaphysics, the science of thinking

36
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,720
and the science of being what being.

37
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,360
But it won't repel any possible skepticism

38
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,800
as to whether that is knowing, whether it is science,

39
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:07,600
and whether it is all that science and knowing could be.

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,240
That is to say, if you really want

41
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:12,480
to press Hegel with skeptical objections

42
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,380
about the possibility of a science of logic

43
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:20,960
slash metaphysics, the following short argument won't suffice.

44
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,800
So there's a passage in the science of logic

45
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:30,480
that I think indicates that he has something

46
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,120
like the following short argument in mind.

47
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,440
This is at 2134.

48
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,640
On the other side, one can appeal

49
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,920
to the representations typical of ordinary logic.

50
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,520
For it is assumed that in definitions,

51
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,440
for example, the determinations are not just

52
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,240
of the knowing subject, but are rather determinations

53
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,120
of the subject matter, such that constitutes

54
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,760
in our most essential nature.

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,880
So the idea is, just like totally ordinary logic,

56
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,960
we assume that when we define a concept,

57
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,640
we haven't just learned something about our concept.

58
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,020
We've learned something about being.

59
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,560
If I say, let concepts be, that's a bad example,

60
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,120
let a bachelor refer to unmarried males.

61
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,560
We've learned both what the concept bachelor is,

62
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:23,120
and we've learned what bachelors are.

63
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,320
We've learned something about the world,

64
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,720
and we've learned something about our concepts.

65
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,440
And those are two different facts

66
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,520
under two different modes of description.

67
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,960
It's not possible for those things to come apart.

68
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,640
Now, it might be that our concepts

69
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,160
don't carve reality at instruction.

70
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,200
So merely defining might not get you at the structure.

71
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,120
Might be that, as probably as difficult.

72
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:51,360
Being is not carved up into bachelors in life.

73
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,560
This is not an ontologically important distinction.

74
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:59,680
But if you can just do ordinary logic,

75
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,280
you can't really entertain skepticism

76
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,720
about whether ordinary logic is truer.

77
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,080
And that means either you can't do logic in ordinary sense,

78
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,240
or ordinary logic is already a guide to being.

79
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,000
Or in an inference drawn from given determinations

80
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:20,720
to others, the assumption is that the inferred

81
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,080
is not something external to the subject matter

82
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,280
and alien to it, but that it belongs to it instead.

83
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,680
That to the thought, there corresponds being.

84
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,080
So what Hegel has in mind is just

85
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,160
in doing a totally ordinary inference in what is ordinarily

86
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:47,080
called logic, you have to presuppose you can't entertain

87
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,640
skepticism about, so to speak, the metaphysical importance

88
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,480
of that claim.

89
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:57,440
So let's just, as simple as possible inference,

90
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,640
I'm not even sure that Hegel considered this inference.

91
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:10,240
So let's say P, therefore, either P or Q, this is called.

92
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,400
Not necessarily an inference that logicians

93
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
in the ordinary sense would accept in Hegel's input.

94
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,480
So let's just back it up.

95
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:23,560
Now, if you've accepted this as a valid inference in logic,

96
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:30,840
you've accepted that if P is true, then P or Q is true.

97
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:47,440
So you've also accepted that if P, then if P or Q. Now, you can't,

98
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,440
as long as you accept this as a rule of inference in logic,

99
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:56,960
you have to accept that it preserves truth.

100
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,240
And if you accept that it preserves truth,

101
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,040
you've accepted, essentially, a claim about reality.

102
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,800
Because notice, this doesn't say anything about inference or truth.

103
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,120
This is, so to speak, purely metaphysical.

104
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,280
It just makes a claim about the world.

105
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,680
And this is what we do in logic.

106
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:26,440
So if you can do this, and this is knowing, if you know this,

107
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,440
then you know some things about the world.

108
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,880
And you know them purely.

109
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:34,520
So either you're a skeptic about this, and then Hegel thinks,

110
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,800
well, now you can't do any science of anything.

111
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,440
You're a real skeptic.

112
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,840
Because you'll be like, oh, here's just another example.

113
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:49,920
P and Q, therefore, P and Q. I know Hegel was German,

114
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,200
and I know Kant was German.

115
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,440
But I don't know whether Kant was German and Hegel was German.

116
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,400
Now you've just totally made it impossible for yourself

117
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,480
to do science about anything.

118
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,920
So the idea is, just in accepting ordinary logical

119
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,640
inference as preserving truth, you

120
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:12,680
are accrediting yourself knowledge of the world.

121
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,480
Because that is actually indirectly knowledge

122
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,080
of the world.

123
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,600
Now, you might think that's really trivial formal knowledge

124
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,680
of the world.

125
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,800
And Hegel will say, that's what you're totally entitled to think

126
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,120
of that until you read my logic.

127
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,640
Because what I'm going to show you

128
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,120
is things even more basic than this develop

129
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,760
really contentful knowledge.

130
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,560
So the idea is this, Hegel wants to get you

131
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,560
on the hook for thinking that there's no, let me just finish,

132
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:39,640
there's no coherent skepticism about the metaphysical import

133
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,040
of logic.

134
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:43,760
We can just translate from logical truths

135
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,280
to metaphysical truths, although they're

136
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,200
pretty rinky dinky metaphysical truths so far.

137
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,160
Here's another example.

138
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:57,120
Can you coherently entertain skepticism

139
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,960
about the law of logic?

140
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,080
There are no true contradictions.

141
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,120
So let's just say the principle of contradiction

142
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,560
is there are no true contradictions.

143
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,120
OK.

144
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,000
Now, if you accept that as a law of logic,

145
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Hegel thinks, you have to accept not merely,

146
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,360
oh, you shouldn't think that there

147
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,200
are any true contradictions.

148
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:37,640
But there are no contradictory thoughts.

149
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,840
That is to say, anything that's contradictory

150
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,120
isn't actually thinkable.

151
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,160
So the question is, can you entertain the following thought?

152
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,720
There are no contradictory, self-contradictory thoughts.

153
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:08,000
But maybe the principle of contradiction

154
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:17,680
is inaccurate about being capitalized.

155
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,920
Is that a coherent thought?

156
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,720
Well, no, Hegel thinks.

157
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:25,080
Because insofar as you entertain that,

158
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:35,760
you're entertaining the thought maybe it

159
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:46,440
is inaccurate to being that there

160
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:51,200
are no true contradictions.

161
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,000
Well, what's a true contradiction?

162
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:04,240
It's a contradictory thought.

163
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,840
So to entertain skepticism about the metaphysical import

164
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:12,600
of the principle of contradiction is self-underbody.

165
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,360
Because you're attempting to hold in your thought.

166
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,920
There are no self-contradictory thoughts.

167
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,800
But maybe there are some true ones.

168
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,160
Now, this presupposes two things.

169
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,600
It presupposes what's called the constitutive conception

170
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,120
of logic.

171
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:43,160
That is to say, it presupposes that what you find out in logic

172
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,040
is the structure that thoughts have to have.

173
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,800
Not the structure that they ought to have,

174
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,600
but the structure that thoughts as such have.

175
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,800
And that's why it's incoherent to entertain that

176
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,240
and then entertain skepticism of whether it might be some others.

177
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,520
And secondly, the truth is the predicate of thoughts.

178
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:14,400
Because that's what allowed me to go from there's

179
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,840
true contradictions, there are true contradictory thoughts.

180
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,760
Without that, this argument doesn't work.

181
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,000
Now, this is an oversimplification

182
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,680
because Hegel doesn't really hold this view.

183
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,000
Doesn't really hold the constitutive conception

184
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,320
of logic.

185
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,640
And this is a thing you might think,

186
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,960
maybe Hegel's thought is vulnerable there.

187
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,440
Maybe he's just assuming a certain idealist view.

188
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:44,480
Namely, that truth is a matter of thought.

189
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,720
But I actually don't think Hegel is vulnerable on that point.

190
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,400
So here's the idea.

191
00:11:52,440 --> 00:12:04,960
The idea is let's see if we can make skepticism

192
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,720
about the metaphysical import of logic coherent

193
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,880
by distancing reality from thought.

194
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,240
We could say, look, there might be contradictions.

195
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,600
It might be the case that P had not P. Even though we have

196
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,520
to think, we can't think that.

197
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,520
There can't be any P and not P thoughts.

198
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,440
So already, you're like, well, what was I doing?

199
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:37,800
But already, so then, next move, if P and not P is the case,

200
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:43,680
then isn't it the case that P and not P is true?

201
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,880
So you could reject that.

202
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,280
That's potentially a question.

203
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,440
But then Hegel, I think his question would be,

204
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,520
what are you even talking about?

205
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:59,560
How could it be the case that this, without it being true?

206
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:02,280
I think Hegel thinks this is the most trivial thing

207
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,440
in philosophy.

208
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:09,960
Q if and only if it's true that Q.

209
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:14,640
The way in which Donald Davidson is a Hegelian.

210
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,440
Although, actually, there was a lecture here years ago

211
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,000
about what kind of idealist is Hegel.

212
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,040
And my objection at one point was, well, if this is right,

213
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,360
then Donald Davidson is an absolute idealist.

214
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,840
And the speaker was like, yes, exactly, Donald Davidson.

215
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,440
That's not right.

216
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,760
Now we're a good friend of mine.

217
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,680
So then the question is, OK.

218
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,320
So that doesn't look, that Hegel looks pretty good then.

219
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,480
The next thing you could say is P and not P is not a thought.

220
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,840
So you might think, OK, look, sure,

221
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:01,560
we can't think contradictory whatevers.

222
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:05,840
But truth is not a property of thoughts.

223
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,240
It's a property of something like propositions.

224
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:22,280
So I just want to know, when Hegel talks about thoughts,

225
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:26,000
he doesn't mean activities of human spirit.

226
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,040
He means the content of activities of human spirit.

227
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:36,880
So thought in Hegel, pedanka, is something

228
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:43,440
like a content of thought in the psychological sense.

229
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,160
So then I want to know, what does this person

230
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:56,520
mean by a proposition if they don't mean a content of thought?

231
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,840
And if they really mean, oh, the propositions

232
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,840
are not contents of thoughts, then I

233
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,360
have no idea what they're talking about.

234
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,440
And I'm not sure that they know what they're talking about.

235
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,560
So finally, the final source of possible skepticism

236
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:18,360
about this argument is you might say, oh,

237
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,120
but logic isn't about propositions.

238
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,280
It's just about our thinking.

239
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:29,800
But then you've saved logic from having

240
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,720
any metaphysical import by making it purely psychological.

241
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,520
It's just about our psychological activities

242
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,960
rather than its content.

243
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,520
So the Hegelian point is there's no pathway

244
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:45,480
once you accept that we do logic in the ordinary sense,

245
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,600
without which there's no science of anything.

246
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:52,600
And once you've accepted that logic is not just psychology,

247
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,920
not about the psychological activity of thought

248
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,440
that happens in space and time, so the content of thought,

249
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,480
then you're on the hook for the metaphysical import of logic.

250
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:08,160
So that's the short argument to the conclusion

251
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,320
that if we can determine non-trivial facts

252
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,000
about the content of thinking as such, any thinking as such,

253
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,240
we will have determined non-trivial facts

254
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,160
about the structure of being.

255
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:29,040
That is to say, we can go from logic to medical.

256
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,440
Now, this by itself isn't that interesting

257
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,480
if all it gets to you is trivial logical truth.

258
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:46,720
Very few people would deny that the tautologies

259
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,600
of predicate logic, or tautologies

260
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,360
of propositional logic, are metaphysically necessary.

261
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,120
The Hegelian, what makes this more interesting

262
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,120
is Hegel is going to argue that the structure according

263
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,440
to which thought just as such has to think

264
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:10,520
is significantly richer and more contentful than just

265
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:13,280
the tautologies of propositional logic, much less

266
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,400
the tautologies of Aristotelian logic, which are just

267
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,880
like the principle contradiction.

268
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:22,560
This is the stuff that I went over last time

269
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,960
in a little bit more detail than I went over last.

270
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,040
So here's another thing.

271
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:31,120
Hegel fundamentally doesn't think of logic in terms of laws.

272
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,640
So we now think of logic as the laws of what is true.

273
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,560
What follows from what?

274
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,220
And then there are some trivial things

275
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,440
that follow from no assumptions whatsoever,

276
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,120
and they're just true.

277
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,160
Those are the laws of logic.

278
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,120
Hegel doesn't really think in those terms.

279
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,560
The logic is much more about determinant thought content.

280
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,880
So we can replace this and make it

281
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:59,360
a more Hegelian-friendly point if we say not

282
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,520
that which is not self-contradictory thoughts,

283
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:14,520
but something like there are no thoughts that are not

284
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,800
f not f determinant.

285
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:29,240
That is to say, f not f marks a joint in logic,

286
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:32,080
where every thought has to be determinately

287
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,720
on some side of that.

288
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,520
Or another example would be, there

289
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:42,440
are no thoughts that are not subject predicate thoughts.

290
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:54,640
But maybe it is inaccurate to being because there

291
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:11,960
are true thoughts that are not f not f determinant

292
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,320
or, for example, not subject predicate judgments.

293
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:21,360
So that's more the level at which Hegel is thinking about it.

294
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,180
Once you've accepted that all thought as such

295
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,120
has a certain structure, you cannot then

296
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,040
play the skeptic and be like, but maybe

297
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,320
being self-structured like that, because that

298
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,560
is pretending to think that all thought

299
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,200
is structured a certain way, but certain thoughts that

300
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,360
are not structured that way are true or accurate

301
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,440
to the structure of each.

302
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,640
So at any point in the logic, you're like,

303
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,140
OK, maybe I have to think this way,

304
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,480
but why is being structured that way?

305
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,200
Just reapply this argument.

306
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,240
And if the argument of the logic has succeeded,

307
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,280
that whatever thought structure you're dealing with in the logic

308
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,840
has been imminently derived in such a way

309
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:07,000
that there's no way of doing without that.

310
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,520
These are not contingent thought contacts

311
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,960
that you can think according to or not as you wish.

312
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,400
They are the structure that thought just as such has to do.

313
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:17,920
Yeah.

314
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:21,920
When he says there are no thoughts, such and such,

315
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,120
what does there are means?

316
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,840
If it means that we just were incapable of taking

317
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,840
the thoughts, then that's to reduce the effect

318
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,640
of the sidewalk from the logic.

319
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,800
And if it means there aren't thoughts out there

320
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,120
in this problem, or one of them that

321
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,280
is already assuming some sort of sense of imperialism,

322
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,600
so it's kind of making questions of where you are.

323
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,800
OK, good.

324
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:56,400
How about thought as such cannot but think fill in the blank?

325
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,480
So then, what is a thought contact?

326
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,800
Something that thought as such can think,

327
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,200
not making any claims of a human thinking.

328
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,040
And if it's possible and logic to prove that thought just

329
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,880
as such has to think in certain ways,

330
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,400
then we're off to the risk.

331
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,400
OK, yeah?

332
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,360
Very simple question because I'm very confused.

333
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,800
So my mental activity, my psychological activity

334
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:24,280
of thinking in the normal sense, thinking there exists an exercise

335
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,640
that I'd be able to not recognize,

336
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,040
is that not the general decision that people recorded?

337
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,080
OK, yeah.

338
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:34,680
So your question puts, you're putting your finger

339
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,560
on the question, what is the relationship

340
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,120
between human thinking, an activity that

341
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,240
occurs in space and time, in particular

342
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,440
datable historical moment, have to think it

343
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,240
as the topic of the logic?

344
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,000
And that is not treated in the logic.

345
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,720
That is a thing that at some point in the system,

346
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,280
we have to figure that out.

347
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,480
We have to ask ourselves, at some point in the system,

348
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:05,080
wait, how do I fit into this?

349
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,640
I'm just a guy in Germany.

350
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,280
I'm finite.

351
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,960
I think sometimes I don't always think,

352
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,600
I haven't been thinking forever, I'm not going to think forever.

353
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,240
What is the relationship between thinking

354
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,800
in the psychological sense to thinking in the logical sense?

355
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,840
And that, of course, that's not just a question for Hegel.

356
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,480
That's a question for everyone who

357
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,880
is not the worst form of psychologist about logic.

358
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:40,560
What is the relationship between logic and psychology?

359
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,480
Or what is the bearing of logic on thinking

360
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,200
in the psychological sense?

361
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,320
And so if Hegel's system works out properly,

362
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,480
we're going to derive.

363
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,160
We don't yet have in science thinking

364
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,440
in the psychological sense as a topic.

365
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,400
So we have to derive that in science.

366
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,880
There's no who in the logic.

367
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,000
My view of it, your question is, who is thinking the logic?

368
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,960
Who is the subject of the thought of the logic?

369
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,360
Is this the thing that people have different views about?

370
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,400
My view is, that is not a topic of the logic.

371
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,760
That is to say, in logic, we ignore the identity

372
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,560
of the subject of thinking.

373
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:29,640
As we do in normal logic, take a logic class.

374
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,040
We now call them propositions.

375
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:33,240
But they're just contents of thinking.

376
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,000
If you then ask, well, what's the relationship

377
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,360
of this to my psychology?

378
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,720
Your logic teacher will say, this is not what we're doing.

379
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:42,160
I probably assume it's universal thinking.

380
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:45,520
But find me the logic textbook that

381
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,600
wasn't written in Germany in the 19th century that says,

382
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,400
intro logic.

383
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,440
The topic of this book is universal thinking.

384
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,900
Interestingly, there is one 19th century German

385
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,360
logician who says this.

386
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,120
And it's Frege.

387
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:17,080
In Der Gedanken, which is one of three essays

388
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,120
called The Logical Investigations that Frege

389
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,600
published late in life after Bertrand Russell had located

390
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,840
a paradox in and thus destroyed his Frege's life work, who

391
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,160
means that's the basic laws of arithmetic.

392
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,760
Frege wrote these three essays trying

393
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,240
to shore up what remained of his life's work in logic.

394
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,800
The thought, or thought, is the most interesting of them.

395
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:47,640
And he says in that essay that logic is not the study of minds

396
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,040
but of the mind.

397
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:54,520
This is a question that is not just about the mind.

398
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,280
So Frege, who's supposed to be and is

399
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,600
presented as the godfather of good analytic,

400
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,080
non-psychologistic logic as opposed to all this German

401
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,400
idealist bullshit, in one of the key documents,

402
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:15,720
says that logic is the science of the spirit, of spirit.

403
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,360
Not of spirits, but of the spirit.

404
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:24,440
That's a more psychologistic conception of logic than a godfather.

405
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,560
So that's another class that I'll someday teach.

406
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:32,480
Frege as bad German idealist.

407
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,120
Or why analytic philosophy is, in the Marxist sense,

408
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:40,840
a deviation of German idealism.

409
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,320
OK.

410
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
And then I'll be assassinated by you, Mr. Gritty.

411
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,800
OK.

412
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,600
So I just want to emphasize a few things,

413
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,960
because these are things that I'm

414
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,640
worried that you might get the wrong impression about.

415
00:25:55,640 --> 00:26:01,240
One, logic is not about thinking in the psychological sense.

416
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,120
It's not about the activity of human beings thinking.

417
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:09,280
It's about what thinking just as such has to think.

418
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,560
It's about the content of thinking as such.

419
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,600
Hegel, unfortunately, just uses the word thought for that.

420
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,720
Now, that thought has this bad ambiguity.

421
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,440
It can be both Nick Stang's thought

422
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,960
and what Nick Stang thinks.

423
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,360
It's only the second sense in which we're interested,

424
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,920
the sense in which my thought can be exactly the same as yours.

425
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:37,080
And we're not interested in the identity of who

426
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:38,680
or what thinks these thoughts.

427
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,720
Yeah.

428
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:46,280
So that means, as Hegel says, page three of the handout,

429
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:49,520
instead of using the expression thoughts,

430
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,720
it would thus be better to speak of thought determinations

431
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,880
and to avoid any misunderstandings.

432
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,800
So what does that mean?

433
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:01,520
It means that in logic, we study the content of thought.

434
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:04,680
So what we study is what makes a thought

435
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,200
determinantly the thought it is, namely its content.

436
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,960
Or thoughts are individuated.

437
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:13,000
They are what they are in virtue of their content,

438
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,880
because what they are is thought content.

439
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:18,000
Now, he's not saying that everything thinks

440
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,760
or that everything is a thought.

441
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,280
The identity of being and thinking

442
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:24,080
must, however, not be taken in a concrete sense.

443
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,080
Hence, what is not to say that a stone that has being

444
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,320
is the same as a thinking human being.

445
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:32,480
He's not saying that a stone is a thought.

446
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:38,040
He's saying is there might be stones that we can never,

447
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,280
there's going to be facts about stones that human beings can

448
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,080
never know.

449
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,560
There might be physical objects that

450
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,400
are too distant for us to experience.

451
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,760
There may be physical objects that are too far in the past

452
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,640
for us to know about.

453
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:54,560
But nothing in being can be logically alien to us.

454
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,200
Everything has the structure of thought.

455
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,480
And since the structure of thought

456
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,360
is not these trivial, tautologous things,

457
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,920
like the principle of contradiction,

458
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,760
it's the very determinate, contentful structure

459
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,640
of the logic that is a metaphysics worth calling

460
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,560
the end.

461
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:17,080
So this science of just the content of what thought

462
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,080
as such as to think will also be the science of being just

463
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,520
as being or being or being the traditional definition

464
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,120
of metaphysics.

465
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:30,560
Now, everything that we do is a modification of thinking.

466
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,800
So willing is thinking about what to do or what is good,

467
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,360
what is choice worth.

468
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:41,120
Desiring also is thinking about what you want.

469
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,600
Perceiving is seeing what is the case.

470
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,720
The content of your perception is also

471
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,920
the content of a thought.

472
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:54,760
You see that the book is on the table.

473
00:28:54,760 --> 00:29:01,520
Hegel thinks that the marker of thought content is is, is being.

474
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,920
So we don't just see objects.

475
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,680
We see that things are the case.

476
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:12,200
And so the content of perception is also the content of thought.

477
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,040
Thinking can appear to be just one capacity

478
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,640
of one kind of animals.

479
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,760
That's thinking in the psychological sense.

480
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:22,440
But it can't be just that.

481
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:27,240
If it were just that, if it were like human vision,

482
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:30,240
then the following we'd be coherent.

483
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:33,000
There is an object that we can think about.

484
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,760
There are objects that we can think about.

485
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,200
And there are objects we cannot think about.

486
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,680
Just as there are objects we can see

487
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,520
and there are objects we cannot see.

488
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,960
Or in Aristotelian terms, thought cannot be an organ.

489
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,520
Can't be one capacity among others

490
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,880
that has one characteristic object over others.

491
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,160
Anything that can be is the, and that

492
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,480
means that thinkable is transcendental,

493
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,040
not in the Kantian sense, but in the original sense

494
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:09,320
in which unity, truth, and goodness are transcendental.

495
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,560
This is traditional doctrine that all beings are one, true,

496
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,080
and good.

497
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,040
That oneness, truth, and goodness are

498
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,280
constitutive of any being.

499
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,400
And they're interconverted.

500
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,640
Thought is transcendental in something like that sense.

501
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:28,480
All beings just as such are thinkable,

502
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,960
and all thought is about being.

503
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:37,720
That's why the purported claim, or one

504
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:40,320
way to get at that point about the transcendental character

505
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,040
of thought is the claim there is something that cannot be

506
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,440
thought is self-undermining.

507
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,360
So if we think of the development

508
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,480
of transcendental philosophy after Kant

509
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,280
as trying to find a master notion such

510
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,000
that what we do in philosophy is we

511
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,520
study how that is possible.

512
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,200
And then there's nothing outside of that.

513
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:07,600
We can think, OK, in Kant in some way it's representation,

514
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,280
but representation is too broad.

515
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,240
It can't be cognition, because in Kant

516
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,480
there are things we can represent

517
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,680
that we can't cognize, et cetera, et cetera.

518
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:22,400
There are other possible candidates for the notion.

519
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,120
Some of them aren't going to work.

520
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:29,560
Like, for instance, Robert Pippin in his most recent book,

521
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,520
The Culmination, which is about Heidegger in relation

522
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:37,720
to German idealism, thinks Heidegger wins

523
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,520
because the thing that philosophy should really

524
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,000
be about is meaningfulness.

525
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
The Deutschland.

526
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:49,480
There's the small problem that that's not what being is.

527
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,760
All that taric decay makes that point.

528
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,160
But Beidouitzamkite, meaningfulness,

529
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:58,920
is not a plausible candidate for our fundamental access

530
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,800
to everything, because the following

531
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,920
is perfectly coherent.

532
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,120
There are things that are not meaningful to me.

533
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:11,640
So there's something beyond the realm of Beidouitzamkite.

534
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,200
So if we want to study the fundamental way in which

535
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,280
human beings are onto something, or about stuff,

536
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,960
or represent things, use Kantian terminology,

537
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,400
that which is meaningful to us is not a good starting point.

538
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,920
Because we can obviously be onto or intentionally

539
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,160
relate or represent or think about things that

540
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,120
are not meaningful to us.

541
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,160
There's a lot of stuff that's completely meaningless to me.

542
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,720
That sounded dark.

543
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,000
Whoops, like formal epistemology.

544
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,600
Completely devoid of Beidouitzamkite, but it has been.

545
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:54,400
The following, however, is self-underbinder.

546
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:57,120
There is something I cannot think about.

547
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,080
That means that a plausible case can

548
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:03,480
be made for why the fundamental notion

549
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,480
in transcendental philosophy, the thing that properly

550
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:12,400
describes human-mindedness relationship to anything

551
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:19,280
that it can be onto, is not meaningfulness but thinking.

552
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,160
OK.

553
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,480
Now thinking as the activation of a capacity in human beings

554
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:27,120
does not create, generate, et cetera, being.

555
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,880
It's not that being is a product of human thinking.

556
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,040
It's that any more than human thinking

557
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,840
is the product of the laws of logic.

558
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,520
It's that there's no thinkable distinction

559
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:42,200
between the structure of the content of thinking as such

560
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,400
and the structure of being.

561
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:44,920
OK.

562
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,920
Let me just, the first thing, the next thing

563
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:54,960
I'll go over very quickly is what Kantian logic does,

564
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,600
Hegelian logic correspond to.

565
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,760
In some sense, it's neither of them

566
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,600
because it isn't about a capacity or any capacities

567
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,320
of human mind.

568
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,400
On the one hand, it's more like transcendental logic

569
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:14,000
because it's about the content above.

570
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,640
But on the other hand, it's also more like pure general logic

571
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,800
because it's about the form of thinking.

572
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,600
But really, it's neither slash both of them

573
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:25,520
because in studying a form of thinking,

574
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,880
you also uncover all of its content.

575
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,520
So something like pure general logic and transcendental logic

576
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,640
become kind of the same for Hegel with the proviso

577
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,160
that they don't become the same because the content of thought

578
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:39,000
is provided by sensibility.

579
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,680
And this one logic, which is both transcendental and pure

580
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:47,600
general, is not about any capacities of the human mind.

581
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,440
OK.

582
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,560
Now furthermore, so the thing in Kant that most closely

583
00:34:52,560 --> 00:35:00,400
corresponds to Hegelian logic is the metaphysical deduction

584
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:05,600
with the proviso that Hegel thinks of his deduction

585
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:10,640
of the categories of thought as more systematic or imminent than Kant's.

586
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,360
And there's no separation.

587
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,800
We don't first deduce all of the predidational forms of judgment

588
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,840
and then deduce the categories of thought.

589
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:21,000
The categories themselves are also predication forms.

590
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,640
So the first category of logic is being.

591
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,920
That's also the most basic form of predication is.

592
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,520
As we'll see next week, it's prior even to the distinction

593
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,080
between subject and predicate.

594
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:38,640
So each of the categories of the logic is also a kind of predication.

595
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,720
OK.

596
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,840
Skip the historical background.

597
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:47,280
A lot of this is not particularly important.

598
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:47,960
OK.

599
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,680
I'm going to skip the stuff about method

600
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,360
because it will come back in a couple of weeks.

601
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
OK.

602
00:35:54,360 --> 00:36:08,240
So dialectic, remember, is originally in ancient philosophy

603
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:12,760
or in ancient philosophical practice the art of reputation.

604
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,840
It's how you, as they say on YouTube, destroy people.

605
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:22,080
That's all the YouTube videos of like Ben Shapiro destroys liberal.

606
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,080
That's all dialectic.

607
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,760
The worst possible dialectic, although Ben Shapiro

608
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:31,360
has an undergraduate degree in philosophy, I believe,

609
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,800
his parents should get a tuition, a reimbursement.

610
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,440
OK.

611
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,440
I mean, whatever, he's a sophist.

612
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,600
Sorry, I don't want to pick on Ben Shapiro.

613
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,280
Most so-called public intellectuals, most of public intellectual life

614
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,280
is just sophistry.

615
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,720
It's just using rhetorical skills to make the weaker argument to be stronger.

616
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,280
If you haven't figured this out already, this is some good news.

617
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,240
A philosophy education is the best possible education in sophistry.

618
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,440
We're not teaching you how to be sophists,

619
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,280
but we've given you all the skills necessary for maximal sophistry.

620
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,080
You've already probably figured this out.

621
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,840
Just with a little philosophical training,

622
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,080
you can win any argument with your friends

623
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,040
about things you know nothing about because you know as a philosopher,

624
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,520
you just immediately move the terrain onto something

625
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:27,000
where knowledge doesn't matter.

626
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,600
And then the classic philosophy move is to be like, well,

627
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:31,680
I don't know what that means.

628
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,960
And now what you've done is you just all their knowledge

629
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,480
has now been made irrelevant because they actually know what it means.

630
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,600
And you're like, I don't know.

631
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:44,840
So this is also why philosophy is the best possible preparation for law

632
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,760
school.

633
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,920
So you have all the skills necessary to be a really, really successful

634
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,680
YouTube sophist.

635
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,800
I hope you don't do that with your philosophy training.

636
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,080
So that's what dialectic is originally.

637
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:07,080
Hegel praises Kant's transcendental dialect.

638
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,080
In particular, the Antinomies, he doesn't really

639
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,280
care about the rest of the dialectic.

640
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,360
He always identifies the dialect with the Antinomies.

641
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,040
Because what Kant discovered is that there's

642
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,280
a dialectic built into reason itself.

643
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:23,280
That is to say, reason itself generates these contradictions.

644
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:31,680
The problem is that Kant was too freaked out by his own discovery

645
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:34,320
and thought, oh, what that shows is we better not

646
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,480
try to cognize the unconditioned in things

647
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,320
themselves using the categories.

648
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,960
Instead, what he should have realized

649
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,720
is that the categories in their fixed determinant relationships

650
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,720
to one another generate contradictions.

651
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:52,480
That's the dialectic of the categories themselves.

652
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,960
Just those concepts themselves dialectically undermine themselves.

653
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:02,800
Now, Hegel's conception of dialectic is not,

654
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,080
as we saw in the phenomenology, is not just negative.

655
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:09,640
It's not just that some set of categories

656
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:12,600
generate contradictions and therefore undermine themselves.

657
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,560
It also generates, it's also positive, it's also generated.

658
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,360
It generates new categories.

659
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,760
And Hegel's name for this kind of philosophy

660
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:27,560
or this kind of logic, which works by uncovering,

661
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,920
makes it sound like we're doing something.

662
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,720
But I'm going to say it anyways.

663
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,000
Uncovering contradictions or letting concepts contradict

664
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:42,800
themselves and then resolve that contradict in a higher concept

665
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,280
is he calls that speculative.

666
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:53,480
So another way of putting that is Hegel's logic is speculative.

667
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:58,280
That doesn't mean it's speculative in the way of like,

668
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,880
we don't have really good evidence for what happens

669
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,960
10 to the minus seconds after the Big Bang,

670
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,560
but this kind of seems right.

671
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,840
It's not tentative.

672
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:13,680
It works by thought context and contradicting themselves

673
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:18,840
and something resolving that contradiction.

674
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,040
It is in this dialectic as understood here,

675
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,720
and hence in grasping opposites in their unity

676
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,080
or the positive in the negative that the speculative consists.

677
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,600
So that's a foreshadowing of the nature of the contradictions

678
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,920
that will arise in the logic.

679
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,360
The nature of the contradictions that

680
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:42,960
will arise in the logic is you have two categories that

681
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,000
are defined, or what they are, they're

682
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:55,280
determinately what they are through their difference

683
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,600
from one another.

684
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,880
One category in the marriage.

685
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,680
This is the negation of C1.

686
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,760
This is the negation of C2.

687
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:11,280
But it will also prove to be the case that they are the same.

688
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,880
So I have categories that are defined through their difference

689
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,760
like one and many, and then we'll

690
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:19,760
turn out that the one is many and the many is one.

691
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,760
That's a contradiction.

692
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,720
Now the hard thing will be to see how you resolve that,

693
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,400
because it can't be us being like, oh, I

694
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,120
have an idea how to resolve that.

695
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,120
That would be external.

696
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,160
It would be insufficiently imminent.

697
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:37,760
Somehow the contradiction has to resolve itself,

698
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,880
or just the thought contents themselves

699
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,720
have to resolve the contradiction that they

700
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,640
themselves are.

701
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:53,000
So as Hegel says, it is thinking that causes the wound

702
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,800
and heals it too.

703
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,920
So thinking causes its own contradictions and resolves it.

704
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,840
But while going about its business,

705
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,960
it so happens that thinking becomes

706
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,360
entangled in contradictions.

707
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:11,920
It loses itself in the fixed non-identity of its thoughts.

708
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:12,720
That's what this.

709
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,800
These things are what they are because of what they are not.

710
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,960
It loses itself in the fixed non-identity of its thoughts

711
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,800
and in the process does not attain itself,

712
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,080
but instead remains caught up in its opposite.

713
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,520
The higher aspiration of thinking

714
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:29,160
goes against this result produced by thinking satisfied

715
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:31,240
with merely understanding.

716
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:35,240
So this structure, where a concept is what

717
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:38,200
it is through its negative relationship to something else,

718
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,600
is what Hegel identifies as the understanding.

719
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:58,000
Now, he, along with Kant, he acknowledges a difference

720
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,000
between understanding and reason.

721
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:13,800
But he thinks Kantian reason, Kantian fernund,

722
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,440
is also locked at this level.

723
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:24,240
Because Kantian reason just seeks conditions

724
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,840
for given conditioned objects where those conditioning

725
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,880
relations are defined through the categories, which

726
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:36,960
are themselves fixed in determinant identity.

727
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:39,600
So this is all Kantian.

728
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:44,520
This is all what Hegel would call understanding

729
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:46,760
or what Kant would call reason, including

730
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,760
what Kant would call understanding.

731
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:57,840
Or another way of putting this is

732
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:01,360
what Hegel calls understanding, subsumes Kantian understanding

733
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:04,560
and Kantian reason.

734
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:12,120
Hegelian reason is what resolves the contradiction.

735
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:21,240
So this is purely negative, or the negative dialectic.

736
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:35,320
Now, that means, although the logic is not about understanding

737
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:40,040
and reason, we can correlate what's

738
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:45,640
going on in the logic with these mental capacities.

739
00:44:45,640 --> 00:44:47,760
So once again, we have to always distinguish.

740
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:51,840
Hegel is not, he doesn't just talk

741
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,080
about the topics of one science in the book

742
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:55,440
that that science is about.

743
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,840
He also talks about other things.

744
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,120
And so you have to be careful to separate them.

745
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,040
So these reasons of understanding

746
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:03,920
are not properly logical topics.

747
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,160
These are anticipations of his conception

748
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:10,160
of the capacities of spirit, the capacities of the mind.

749
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:19,960
I'm going to skip that and talk about with what

750
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,640
must the beginning of science be made.

751
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:26,720
Questions up to this point.

752
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,220
Yes.

753
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:36,080
So if you know P, then you know about the world.

754
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:40,840
But our knowledge is perception, our perception,

755
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,080
and our subject is perception.

756
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:51,400
So how do we can say if we know P, and P is not perception?

757
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,800
OK, so I think you're running together

758
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,880
two different parts of the Hegelian story.

759
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:04,560
So not everything we know is through perception,

760
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,080
because the contents of logic is not something

761
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:10,880
that we can perceive.

762
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,520
However, what we can perceive is thinkable content.

763
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:19,560
Therefore, it has the logical structure

764
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:21,760
that will be uncovered in the logic.

765
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,520
You perceive determinate beings.

766
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,840
You perceive them as having qualities.

767
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:29,120
You perceive them as being one and many.

768
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:31,520
You perceive them as quantitatively determinate.

769
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,720
You perceive them as being measurable.

770
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:36,040
You perceive a difference between how they are

771
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:38,440
and how they appear to you under certain circumstances,

772
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:40,120
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

773
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:43,760
So the deep logical structure of the content of perception

774
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:47,560
is also provided in the logic, but the topic of the logic

775
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:51,360
is not that content qua perceivable.

776
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:53,520
OK, yes.

777
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,400
You said that if you don't want to be like a psychological,

778
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,560
if you want to make logic entirely psychological,

779
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,440
then you have to accept.

780
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,880
But surely the psychological alternative

781
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:08,440
is like the elephant in the room.

782
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:11,640
That's the one that I would go to naturally

783
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,440
if I was a skeptic.

784
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:16,520
So should I just read the phenomenology of spirit?

785
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:20,280
I think that's Hegel's considered answer.

786
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,840
What he kind of says in the introduction is,

787
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,240
yeah, go study with Frese and stop bugging me.

788
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,800
That is to say, I think Hegel just in the introduction

789
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,600
just has no time for that view.

790
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:42,360
So Frese is this guy who he's like a Kantian,

791
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,080
but he thinks that Kant's transcendental philosophy

792
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,120
is psychology.

793
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:52,280
And Hegel has nothing but contempt for that view.

794
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:54,760
There's a great book about, so one

795
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,280
of the things that happens over the course of the 19th century

796
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:00,360
is German philosophers periodically go back to Kant

797
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,400
and are like, wait, all the answers were here all along.

798
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:04,400
Let's just do this.

799
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,700
Let's forget about this fifth The Schelling Hegel stuff.

800
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,280
It's incomprehensible.

801
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:12,480
And maybe it's falsified by natural science.

802
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,840
There's a great book about the whole thing

803
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,720
by Fred Beiser called The Genesis of Neocontinism.

804
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,560
And that book is basically the history of Kantians being like,

805
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,960
oh, let's make this all about psychology.

806
00:48:25,960 --> 00:48:28,800
And then at some point, they're like, wait.

807
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:31,480
If it's all about psychology, then it's just

808
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,400
about stuff in space and time.

809
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:36,080
And so it can't explain how knowledge in space and time

810
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,840
is possible.

811
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:39,280
And then they're like, oh, I'm not

812
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:40,560
sure what to do about that.

813
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:42,920
So it has this slightly dissatisfying quality

814
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,320
of you can see the problem coming

815
00:48:44,320 --> 00:48:46,600
a million times, a million miles away,

816
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,100
and then all of these 19th century

817
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,200
psychologists and neocontians eventually

818
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:52,200
figure out the thing that was obvious on page one.

819
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:52,680
Yeah?

820
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:54,000
Maybe you'll get to this later.

821
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,800
What's then the upshot of me just sitting here

822
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,080
doing regular metaphysics?

823
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,720
What's the upshot?

824
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,120
For Kant, it becomes we're not talking about things

825
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,480
in themselves.

826
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,040
Is there an analogous thing for Hegel?

827
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,160
Oh, you mean what does Hegel think

828
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,800
you're doing if you're just doing spinosistic metaphysics?

829
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,720
Sure.

830
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:18,480
I think he thinks you are thinking,

831
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,440
but you're not thinking purely.

832
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,000
So some of the content of your thought

833
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:25,200
will be pure thought content.

834
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,920
And it will get something about the structure of metaphysics

835
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:28,520
right.

836
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,360
But it won't be scientific.

837
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:36,000
And so it will be a kind of aggregate of genuinely content

838
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
that genuinely reveals the metaphysical structure of being

839
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,640
and then just kind of your opinions and weird stuff.

840
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,880
And so because of his commitments

841
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,560
in the philosophy of history, we have to be able to,

842
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:53,240
if everything Hegel says is true,

843
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,800
then the content of the science of logic

844
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:58,560
has to be findable in the history of philosophy.

845
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,440
So in principle, we should be able to go back

846
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:01,960
through the history of philosophy

847
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:08,640
and find all of this stuff kind of exploded.

848
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,640
It's like there's a logical explosion.

849
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:17,200
And all of the shrapnel, all of the broken shards

850
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,040
of the logic bomb have been spread over time.

851
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:23,880
And this sounds very Dr. Who, but the history of philosophy

852
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:27,400
is like finding all of them and then reassembling them

853
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:30,440
into Hegelian logic as a confirmation

854
00:50:30,440 --> 00:50:32,480
that we were right about the whole thing.

855
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:32,980
Yeah?

856
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,200
What about what's happening now?

857
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:39,360
Well, that's a really good question, actually.

858
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,200
It's actually a very hard question,

859
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:43,920
which is, what does Hegel think about the future?

860
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,160
And he doesn't say anything about it.

861
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:48,900
And so some people think that means Hegel

862
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:50,720
thinks there's no real future.

863
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,840
It's all just this.

864
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,040
Like, we're done.

865
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,240
And we can just repeat it.

866
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,880
That would be very disappointing.

867
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,680
Some people think that shows that Hegel thinks the future is

868
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:04,360
radically open.

869
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,840
That's ridiculous.

870
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:07,760
That's not worth it.

871
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:10,560
I can't even believe that I have to listen to people say that.

872
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:12,920
That would mean that the Hegel system has an outside,

873
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:15,160
or there's some stuff that's outside, which would mean,

874
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,720
OK, it's incoherent at every level.

875
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,600
The thing that people are primarily

876
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,480
concerned with about the Hegel future question

877
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:28,840
is not logical or metaphysics, but his philosophy of right.

878
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:30,720
Because those will see we get to the philosophy of right.

879
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,040
Hegel says in the preface of the philosophy of right,

880
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,720
something that seems to say, not we've come to the final form,

881
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,880
but I can only just describe this

882
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:44,000
because the social system that I'm describing is dead.

883
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,800
It's on its way out.

884
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:48,520
But then what's next?

885
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,760
And Hegel doesn't say, and the philosophy of history

886
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,960
seems to say that there kind of shouldn't be a next, better

887
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:54,840
social form.

888
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,120
So it's really hard to square those two.

889
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:58,480
There is a genuine question moment

890
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,080
to say about the future.

891
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:05,600
Now, my own view is like, your question gets to the question

892
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:11,800
of what happened to philosophy after classical German

893
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:12,320
idealism?

894
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:20,480
And how do you answer that question as a German idealist?

895
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,200
Because from the German idealist perspective, philosophy,

896
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:27,600
even if you're not a Hegelian, philosophy

897
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,400
kind of stopped after Hegel.

898
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:33,160
So Schelling lives much longer than Hegel,

899
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,280
and is actually brought to Hegel by the King of Prussia

900
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,960
to take over what is the Ministry of Education,

901
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:43,960
to take over Hegel's chair in philosophy in Berlin

902
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:47,920
to combat the specter of Hegelianism,

903
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:50,680
because Germans took philosophy really seriously.

904
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:53,760
And then so the everyday hall Schelling out of,

905
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,960
everyone thinks Schelling is dead,

906
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,000
and he looks like he's dead, but he's still alive.

907
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:04,680
Yes, something happens to philosophy

908
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:09,120
from the golden age of classical German philosophy to today,

909
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:14,080
and people vary in their reactions to it.

910
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,120
If you're a committed German idealist, especially

911
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,400
if you're a Hegelian, you really have

912
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:20,200
to think that a lot of what happened after Hegel

913
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,720
wasn't philosophy.

914
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:25,400
Or at least it wasn't moving the ball forward.

915
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,600
It's a repetition of previous things.

916
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:33,720
Now, does that confirm Hegel's philosophy of history,

917
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,160
or his philosophy of history of philosophy?

918
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,160
Does it refute it?

919
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:40,240
We'll talk about that when we get there.

920
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,200
And I don't want to, I've already

921
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:47,160
shown too much of my hand about my own views about these things

922
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:51,360
that I don't want to give you a lecture on the trappitude

923
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:53,160
of philosophy since the death of Hegel.

924
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:54,800
OK, I realize there are other questions,

925
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:58,280
but I also need to get to the question of,

926
00:53:58,280 --> 00:54:03,160
with what must the beginning of science be made?

927
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,800
OK, so once again, on the handout,

928
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:11,440
I've outlined the structure, as I interpret it, of this section.

929
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,520
It starts out with some introductory remarks

930
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,720
about the general question of the problem of the beginning

931
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:19,600
in philosophy, and then it gets an exposition

932
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:23,040
of the beginning of the science a lot, the pure science.

933
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:24,640
And then there's some further reflections,

934
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:27,160
and there's a discussion in Fitbit and other post-contients,

935
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:28,800
which I will skip.

936
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,280
OK, so the first three paragraphs

937
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:35,680
introduce the theme of, what is the beginning of philosophy?

938
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,360
Where that can be understood either

939
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,040
as an ontological or metaphysical beginning, what

940
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:42,280
is the first principle?

941
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:45,720
Or an epistemological or methodological beginning?

942
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:48,320
What is our access to that first principle?

943
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,440
How do we methodologically begin in philosophy?

944
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:54,600
Now, this essay is a response to,

945
00:54:54,600 --> 00:55:00,640
it's an outgrowth of an incredible methodological,

946
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,680
a series of interventions in German philosophy

947
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,840
between Kant and Hegel that become extremely

948
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:12,720
methodologically self-conscious about what philosophy is

949
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:18,400
and how to do it, that I won't go into now.

950
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,000
So the project of science of logic, of course,

951
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:24,720
is to unfold from thought itself the determinations of thought.

952
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:29,880
So the beginning of logic is the first category or thought

953
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:32,400
determination of logic.

954
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:38,000
So the real question here is, what do we begin logically?

955
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,720
Now, should the beginning be immediate,

956
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,800
or should it be immediate?

957
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,480
Now, Hegel begins by telling us that it

958
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,040
can be neither immediate nor immediate,

959
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:54,880
but then goes on immediately to say

960
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,880
that it is both immediate and immediate.

961
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:02,040
He says, in fact, that everything under heaven

962
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,560
and on Earth is both immediate and immediate.

963
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:08,440
So we have to understand what that means.

964
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:12,040
So I think the mistake is assuming

965
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,800
that if something is immediate, it isn't immediate and vice

966
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:20,600
versa, because if that were the case,

967
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,680
then the claim that everything was immediate and immediate

968
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:24,840
would be a contradiction.

969
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,280
And it wouldn't be a contradiction

970
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:28,440
that, so to speak, Hegel takes away or revolves.

971
00:56:28,440 --> 00:56:31,840
It would just be left with a contradiction.

972
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,880
So what do we mean by mediation?

973
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:38,840
Now, there's at least three senses of mediation

974
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:41,000
that are relevant.

975
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:45,680
What I call on the handout, metaphysical mediation,

976
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:49,520
epistemic mediation, and semantic mediation.

977
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,960
And the idea of mediation, I'm looking for the definition,

978
00:56:53,960 --> 00:56:56,600
I put a note about the definition of mediation

979
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,120
in the encyclopedias, but I won't find it in a moment.

980
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:00,960
Here it is.

981
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,920
This is page 40 in the encyclopediologic reading.

982
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,160
I'll just read it out loud.

983
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,680
It's a very short sentence.

984
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:10,840
Mediation means to make a beginning

985
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:13,440
and then to have proceeded to a second item,

986
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:18,000
such that this second item is the way it is only

987
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,520
insofar as one has arrived at it by starting with something

988
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:24,960
that is an other over against it.

989
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:28,720
So mediation means there's two things,

990
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,560
and one of them is arrived at by means of,

991
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,720
and is therefore distinct from, the other.

992
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:39,640
So metaphysical mediation would be something like x,

993
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,240
one thing is in virtue of another,

994
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,360
or it ontologically depends upon another,

995
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,120
or as we now say is grounded in another.

996
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,840
Epistemic mediation would be knowing something

997
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,840
by means of knowing something else.

998
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,640
The classic example would be inferring something

999
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,160
from something else.

1000
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:01,240
And semantic mediation would be that something

1001
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:04,920
has its meaning, or is the content it is,

1002
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,680
in virtue of its relation to something else.

1003
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,720
That would be something like a definition.

1004
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,400
So bachelor is semantically mediated by unmarried.

1005
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,440
If these two concepts are defined in relation

1006
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,440
to one another, they're mutually mediated.

1007
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,680
Now what would a presupposition be?

1008
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:28,720
It would be something that isn't mediated by something else.

1009
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:30,480
So a metaphysi, sorry, it would be something

1010
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,440
that is mediated by something else.

1011
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:36,280
So something is a metaphysical presupposition

1012
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,880
if it grounds something else.

1013
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:40,920
It's an epistemic presupposition

1014
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:43,000
if it allows you to know something.

1015
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,640
It's a semantic presupposition

1016
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:47,120
if it allows you to define something else.

1017
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,680
So if something were presuppositionless,

1018
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,440
it would have to be metaphysically ungrounded,

1019
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,880
epistemically immediate, and semantically immediate.

1020
00:58:55,880 --> 00:59:00,880
Okay, now what is the relevant notion of mediation,

1021
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:02,840
and therefore beginning for Hegel?

1022
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:08,760
Well, in some sense, one and three are identical in the lot.

1023
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:15,360
Because we know something by means

1024
00:59:16,080 --> 00:59:18,560
of its semantic relationships

1025
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,560
of some other thought content.

1026
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:25,160
A thought content is what it is via its semantic relations.

1027
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:28,560
So semantic and metaphysical dependency go together

1028
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:31,880
with one another with respect to things

1029
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:34,920
that are essentially semantic, essentially thought contents.

1030
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:38,120
And likewise, in the logic, we would assume

1031
00:59:38,120 --> 00:59:42,120
that we know things via that which defines them.

1032
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:45,280
But I wanna focus on the third

1033
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,780
because we're focused on thought contents.

1034
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:54,400
Okay, so the project of the logic has to be,

1035
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,760
means that we have to begin with an immediate thought content.

1036
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,280
The first category of the logic

1037
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:01,000
has to be an immediate thought context

1038
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:04,280
because the project is to unfold all the contents

1039
01:00:04,280 --> 01:00:06,500
of thinking from thinking itself.

1040
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:09,700
If it began with a thought content A

1041
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,240
that was semantically mediated by something else B,

1042
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:14,440
that is to say, it was the thought content

1043
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,920
and it was via B or was defined in terms of B,

1044
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:19,540
then we should have started with B.

1045
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:21,680
B would be the true beginning of the logic.

1046
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:27,820
Okay, so we need a immediate beginning for the logic.

1047
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:30,820
Immediate beginning for the logic.

1048
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:32,380
So the beginning of the logic

1049
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:34,220
has to be an immediate thought content.

1050
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:40,300
Okay, so, Hegel gives a little argument at 21.55

1051
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:48,060
for what the beginning of logic should be.

1052
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,160
This is,

1053
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:55,060
is it 25.55?

1054
01:00:58,580 --> 01:01:01,900
So it's actually 25.56.

1055
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:04,780
It's basically the paragraph that begins,

1056
01:01:04,780 --> 01:01:07,980
being is what makes the beginning here and then ends,

1057
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,780
the beginning is there for a pure being.

1058
01:01:11,820 --> 01:01:14,860
But I think actually we can just skip most of that paragraph

1059
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:17,220
and just focus on the last two sentences,

1060
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:19,020
which I have on the handout.

1061
01:01:19,020 --> 01:01:21,220
Just as it cannot have any determination

1062
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:24,100
with respect to another, the beginning,

1063
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:26,500
so to it cannot have any within it.

1064
01:01:26,500 --> 01:01:28,620
It cannot have any content,

1065
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:31,180
or any content would entail distinction

1066
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,700
and the reference of distinct moments to each other

1067
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:35,680
and hence a mediation.

1068
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:39,660
The beginning is therefore pure being.

1069
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:40,960
Okay, so here's my reconstruction

1070
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,740
of how Hegel is reasoning there.

1071
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:45,860
The beginning has to be immediate.

1072
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:50,260
If it were determined, that is to say,

1073
01:01:50,260 --> 01:01:52,220
we're either internally determined,

1074
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:56,060
it has parts that are determined with respect to another,

1075
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:57,580
or if it was determinate with respect

1076
01:01:57,580 --> 01:02:00,220
to something distinct from it, it would be immediate.

1077
01:02:01,580 --> 01:02:02,940
Why?

1078
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:07,420
Because determinacy, to be a specific determinate thing,

1079
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,580
requires not being something else.

1080
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:17,260
And determinacy is a, sorry,

1081
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:24,460
this is slightly less precise than I would have liked.

1082
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:31,300
Let me just articulate this, okay.

1083
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:40,620
So the beginning must be immediate.

1084
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,140
Because if it were not, that which mediates it

1085
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,620
would be a true beginning.

1086
01:02:53,620 --> 01:02:58,620
If it is immediate, then it is indeterminate.

1087
01:03:10,900 --> 01:03:11,740
Why?

1088
01:03:12,860 --> 01:03:17,860
Because determinacy entails negation.

1089
01:03:21,660 --> 01:03:22,500
Why?

1090
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,380
Because determinacy is to be one thing

1091
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:27,780
rather than something else.

1092
01:03:29,220 --> 01:03:32,700
And that requires not being or negation.

1093
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,700
Or in other words, Hegel is appealing to

1094
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:38,500
the Spittisist principle,

1095
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:41,140
omnis determinatio,

1096
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,420
as negatio.

1097
01:03:44,420 --> 01:03:49,420
Okay, this appears in letter 50

1098
01:03:54,460 --> 01:03:58,060
of Spinoza to a guy named Jorig Yellis.

1099
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:01,620
So if you want your name to live in eternity,

1100
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:04,060
and you don't think you have it in you

1101
01:04:04,060 --> 01:04:06,140
to write one of the great works

1102
01:04:06,140 --> 01:04:07,780
of the history of philosophy,

1103
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,940
make sure that one of the great philosophers

1104
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:11,500
of all time writes you a letter.

1105
01:04:12,380 --> 01:04:14,620
And then for now until eternity,

1106
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:19,660
people will mention your name.

1107
01:04:19,660 --> 01:04:22,220
Jorig Yellis, lost history.

1108
01:04:22,220 --> 01:04:25,300
I mention this guy's name in like every class I teach.

1109
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,660
He will live forever.

1110
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:27,740
Is it not letter 50?

1111
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:29,060
No, it is, I have a question.

1112
01:04:29,060 --> 01:04:30,140
Oh, you know, sorry.

1113
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:31,060
Okay, no.

1114
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:37,660
Spinoza doesn't put the word omnisig.

1115
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,500
That's an interpolation.

1116
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:40,740
I think it's interpretively correct.

1117
01:04:40,820 --> 01:04:43,180
I think it's very clear in context.

1118
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,780
He doesn't just say determination is negation.

1119
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,780
He means all determination is negation.

1120
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:51,940
Okay.

1121
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:57,300
So the beginning has to be completely indeterminate.

1122
01:04:58,540 --> 01:05:02,060
Okay, that is to say if it's completely indeterminate,

1123
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,620
if something isn't something else,

1124
01:05:06,620 --> 01:05:08,060
it's also determinate.

1125
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:09,500
It's not that thing.

1126
01:05:09,820 --> 01:05:12,340
It's not just that determinacy entails negation.

1127
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:13,900
They're the same.

1128
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,980
So the beginning of logic has to be

1129
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:17,860
not only completely indeterminate,

1130
01:05:17,860 --> 01:05:19,180
but completely non-negated.

1131
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,660
What is pure science about?

1132
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:26,780
It's about the content of things.

1133
01:05:26,780 --> 01:05:27,900
What does thought think about?

1134
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:28,940
It talks about being.

1135
01:05:30,020 --> 01:05:32,740
So the first category of the logic

1136
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:37,740
has to be completely indeterminate, non-negated being.

1137
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:41,380
Completely indeterminate, immediacy.

1138
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,460
That is to say it's not a thought about this being

1139
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:47,820
or that being, this kind of being, this way of being.

1140
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:49,460
It's just being.

1141
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:55,140
Or as Hegel sometimes characterizes it, purity.

1142
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,140
That means there's a thematic connection

1143
01:05:59,140 --> 01:06:02,660
between the beginning of the logic and sense certainty.

1144
01:06:02,660 --> 01:06:04,860
So one of the things we'll eventually have to talk about

1145
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:06,860
is what exactly is the relationship

1146
01:06:06,900 --> 01:06:09,540
between the beginning of logic and sense certainty.

1147
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,580
And I am not entirely sure what I think about that.

1148
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:13,420
Hojo and then you.

1149
01:06:13,420 --> 01:06:16,500
Yes, so premise one, would you say it's descriptive

1150
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:17,460
or is it normative?

1151
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:19,540
And also is premise one itself a first principle

1152
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:21,700
or is it further justified?

1153
01:06:21,700 --> 01:06:24,220
It's further justified because what we're doing here,

1154
01:06:24,220 --> 01:06:25,660
we're not doing logic yet.

1155
01:06:25,660 --> 01:06:27,660
All of these are external remarks

1156
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:30,780
because none of this stuff has been derived in logic.

1157
01:06:30,780 --> 01:06:34,020
We're all just kind of fancy-footin'.

1158
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:36,100
This is all just like, you know.

1159
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,420
Hegel's like, it's not that he doesn't want to start sign

1160
01:06:40,420 --> 01:06:41,740
pure thinking.

1161
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:45,580
It's like he's delaying the beginning of as long as possible

1162
01:06:45,580 --> 01:06:48,140
so that you have as much preparation as possible

1163
01:06:48,140 --> 01:06:51,580
before we dive right in and think purity.

1164
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:52,420
Yes.

1165
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:53,580
Two questions.

1166
01:06:53,580 --> 01:06:56,380
So can we say negation is pure supposition,

1167
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,940
this is first, and the second question,

1168
01:06:58,940 --> 01:07:00,820
the beginning is pure being.

1169
01:07:01,820 --> 01:07:06,660
Can we say the pure being is I and I is perception?

1170
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:10,220
No, no I, no perception.

1171
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:11,940
However, there is a connection

1172
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:15,460
because the first principle of fixtus philosophy is I

1173
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:18,620
and Hegel thinks that's just as indeterminate

1174
01:07:18,620 --> 01:07:20,140
as pure being.

1175
01:07:20,140 --> 01:07:21,860
And so fixtus to be congratulated

1176
01:07:21,860 --> 01:07:24,140
with a completely indeterminate starting point.

1177
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:29,140
But A, it's not absolute

1178
01:07:29,300 --> 01:07:31,740
because being an I or being a subject,

1179
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:34,540
it's defined through what it isn't,

1180
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:35,460
namely the object.

1181
01:07:35,460 --> 01:07:37,580
So we're not yet at a completely presuppositionless

1182
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,020
or absolute starting point.

1183
01:07:39,020 --> 01:07:44,020
And the way fixtus system of philosophy works,

1184
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,940
when we start with that starting point,

1185
01:07:45,940 --> 01:07:47,700
we can't get any further.

1186
01:07:47,700 --> 01:07:50,420
And Hegel thinks his system is set up in such a way

1187
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:53,060
that we can get further than purity.

1188
01:07:53,060 --> 01:07:53,900
Yeah.

1189
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:55,620
Oh sorry, okay, yeah.

1190
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:59,100
So can we say negation is pure supposition?

1191
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:01,620
I don't wanna go so far as to say

1192
01:08:01,620 --> 01:08:04,740
that negation and presupposition are always the same thing.

1193
01:08:04,740 --> 01:08:07,260
If I presuppose something,

1194
01:08:07,260 --> 01:08:10,940
then there's what's being presupposed

1195
01:08:10,940 --> 01:08:14,300
and what that presupposition supports, so to speak,

1196
01:08:14,300 --> 01:08:15,620
what's supposed.

1197
01:08:15,620 --> 01:08:17,500
There's the supposition and the presupposition.

1198
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,900
They have to be different.

1199
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,580
And so they have to be determinate

1200
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:21,620
with respect to one another.

1201
01:08:21,620 --> 01:08:24,640
So wherever there's presupposition, there is negation.

1202
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:27,020
I wouldn't wanna go so far as to say that negation

1203
01:08:27,500 --> 01:08:29,940
always involves presupposition of all being.

1204
01:08:29,940 --> 01:08:31,140
Yeah.

1205
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,940
So far, in the short argument for idealism

1206
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:38,700
or for thought, has it come from being kind of

1207
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:42,180
as like the assumption of our collection of all being?

1208
01:08:42,180 --> 01:08:45,140
I didn't, that's your interpretation, I didn't say that.

1209
01:08:45,140 --> 01:08:46,260
Okay.

1210
01:08:46,260 --> 01:08:48,380
Being is definitely not a collection of all being.

1211
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,700
Because then being would be a being.

1212
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,300
And there would be the following question.

1213
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:53,940
Is there a being beyond that collection?

1214
01:08:53,940 --> 01:08:56,820
Namely, a being beyond being, and that's incoherent.

1215
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:59,260
Except, I should know there are all these people.

1216
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:04,260
There's this tradition, as some of you know very well,

1217
01:09:04,340 --> 01:09:05,940
of thinking that the form of the good

1218
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,060
in play that would be beyond being.

1219
01:09:08,060 --> 01:09:09,060
So it's not a being.

1220
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:13,300
I can't really make any sense of that.

1221
01:09:13,300 --> 01:09:14,660
Yeah, how do you think?

1222
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:18,420
So is immediacy related to your own collection?

1223
01:09:18,420 --> 01:09:22,140
And what does immediacy, immediacy, distinction

1224
01:09:22,140 --> 01:09:24,660
relate to at the beginning?

1225
01:09:24,700 --> 01:09:26,940
They're related, but they're not identical.

1226
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:31,580
So if there's a condition and a condition,

1227
01:09:31,580 --> 01:09:34,300
then they're distinct and they're determinate

1228
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,100
partly in relation to one another.

1229
01:09:36,100 --> 01:09:38,420
To be a condition is to be the condition

1230
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:40,860
of some condition, which you are not.

1231
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:43,940
To be a condition just to be conditioned by something,

1232
01:09:43,940 --> 01:09:46,020
to have a condition that you are not.

1233
01:09:46,020 --> 01:09:48,140
So those are determinate and they have all negation.

1234
01:09:48,140 --> 01:09:51,500
But not all determinacy negation relations

1235
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,900
are conditioning relations.

1236
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:55,900
Because a conditioning relation is asymmetric.

1237
01:09:55,900 --> 01:09:57,540
So I don't think it's right to say

1238
01:09:57,540 --> 01:09:59,660
that these condition relationships.

1239
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:02,500
So conditioning relations, asymmetric relations

1240
01:10:02,500 --> 01:10:05,860
of ontological dependence, become the topic of the logic.

1241
01:10:05,860 --> 01:10:07,900
They don't start out as the topic of the logic.

1242
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,100
They're the topic of the doctrine of essence,

1243
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,100
the second of the third parts of the logic.

1244
01:10:13,100 --> 01:10:14,220
Yes?

1245
01:10:14,220 --> 01:10:15,700
Can you just say that the beginning

1246
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,900
of being immediate and distinguish

1247
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:21,900
from the immediate is therefore just a meaning?

1248
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:24,980
That is exactly the problem that we'll talk about next week.

1249
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:27,780
That is the problem on which the entire Hegelian enterprise

1250
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:30,460
potentially falters.

1251
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:33,060
And everyone's been worried about this

1252
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,900
since Schelling, his former college roommate,

1253
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:38,500
was kind enough to point this out in public.

1254
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:38,980
Yes?

1255
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:41,300
So we haven't actually started the science of logic

1256
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:42,060
problem yet.

1257
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:42,780
No.

1258
01:10:42,780 --> 01:10:44,140
You have not thought purely yet.

1259
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:44,660
No.

1260
01:10:44,660 --> 01:10:45,660
So we start presumable.

1261
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:47,420
I know that was not meant personally.

1262
01:10:47,420 --> 01:10:49,860
For all I know, you think you're real.

1263
01:10:49,860 --> 01:10:54,020
So we start with being pure being in the actual science of logic.

1264
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:58,420
So this argument doesn't really serve any purpose

1265
01:10:58,420 --> 01:11:00,940
besides to convince ourselves as the reader that OK.

1266
01:11:00,940 --> 01:11:01,440
Yes.

1267
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:01,940
Yes.

1268
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:10,420
What exactly is the problem of needing a beginning?

1269
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:12,220
I think I just lost a step.

1270
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:13,940
OK.

1271
01:11:13,940 --> 01:11:15,820
We want to do pure science.

1272
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:19,020
Yeah.

1273
01:11:19,020 --> 01:11:20,060
We have to start somewhere.

1274
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:20,540
Yeah.

1275
01:11:22,940 --> 01:11:26,660
The starting point has to be scientifically determined.

1276
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:28,180
It can't be arbitrary.

1277
01:11:28,180 --> 01:11:30,780
Because if it were arbitrary, where we get

1278
01:11:30,780 --> 01:11:32,820
might depend on where we started.

1279
01:11:32,820 --> 01:11:35,660
And if where we get is arbitrary, if it's just like,

1280
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:38,860
this is a plausible starting point, then where we get might be arbitrary.

1281
01:11:38,860 --> 01:11:40,420
And that it wouldn't be scientific.

1282
01:11:40,420 --> 01:11:42,920
OK.

1283
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:43,420
Yes.

1284
01:11:46,060 --> 01:11:47,820
Hagle have any friends?

1285
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:49,820
Sorry.

1286
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:50,320
Yes.

1287
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:51,820
He was actually a super fun guy.

1288
01:11:51,820 --> 01:11:54,820
Well, if it's on contemporaries, they're thinking of empirical scientists.

1289
01:11:54,820 --> 01:12:00,140
We're talking about absolute knowledge.

1290
01:12:00,140 --> 01:12:03,460
Were there any empirical scientists who went, hey, there's something in this

1291
01:12:03,460 --> 01:12:04,460
that we ought to know about?

1292
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:04,940
Yes.

1293
01:12:04,940 --> 01:12:07,500
But I don't know enough about it.

1294
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:12,820
So Hagle is intimately acquainted with and involved

1295
01:12:12,820 --> 01:12:15,100
with the empirical natural science of his day.

1296
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:18,420
Knows it as well as it's possible for anyone

1297
01:12:18,420 --> 01:12:20,940
to know all of the sciences of the 19th century.

1298
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:24,100
And in fact, what's the main thing that Hagle

1299
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:28,500
does in the second edition of The Doctrine and Being?

1300
01:12:28,500 --> 01:12:31,820
It's not addressed the problem about the beginning of the logic

1301
01:12:31,820 --> 01:12:34,020
that everyone has been worried about.

1302
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,740
He seems to think there's no problem.

1303
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:37,980
So either there's no problem or Hagle is the worst

1304
01:12:37,980 --> 01:12:40,460
philosopher of the 19th century.

1305
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:42,380
What does he primarily do?

1306
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:48,420
He massively updates the treatment of calculus in The Doctrine and Being.

1307
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:54,060
So there's this enormous digression about the mathematics of the infinite

1308
01:12:54,060 --> 01:12:56,180
in the first half of the science of logic.

1309
01:12:56,180 --> 01:12:57,820
Here's the problem.

1310
01:12:57,820 --> 01:13:01,100
Historical mathematics is weird.

1311
01:13:01,100 --> 01:13:04,260
The calculus you learned in your calculus class

1312
01:13:04,260 --> 01:13:09,860
is cleaned up post-Vierstrass, post-Dedekind presentations of calculus.

1313
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:14,380
When you read historical calculus texts, they're fucking wild.

1314
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:18,540
And they do things in this completely unnatural geometric way.

1315
01:13:18,540 --> 01:13:20,940
Because they don't have a rigorous definition of a limit.

1316
01:13:20,940 --> 01:13:24,900
They don't have a digorous definition of continuity.

1317
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:28,460
So they've got to do it with this kind of jiggery-pogory.

1318
01:13:28,460 --> 01:13:33,220
And Hagle has read all of the relevant books

1319
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:38,260
by Lagrange and everybody and is completely fully up to date with it

1320
01:13:38,260 --> 01:13:46,740
and writes this super long digression about how only his metaphysics of quantity

1321
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:51,300
explains properly what the quantitative infinite is.

1322
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:54,460
And otherwise, you can't do calculus properly.

1323
01:13:54,460 --> 01:14:03,260
So if you want this class to take a really weird 90-degree term, OK.

1324
01:14:03,260 --> 01:14:03,900
That'll be it.

1325
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:05,900
I'll see you next week.

1326
01:14:08,260 --> 01:14:17,580
Can I ask, you can ask all the questions.

1327
01:14:17,580 --> 01:14:23,420
Why is this called German idealism when it seems like such an extreme realism?

1328
01:14:23,420 --> 01:14:31,460
So Marcus Gabriel, his joke about this is the English translation of idealism is realism.

1329
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,580
Now, the reason is, as we see.
