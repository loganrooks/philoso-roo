WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.840
to figure out whether you know that.

00:02.840 --> 00:05.760
What criterion of knowledge should we apply?

00:05.760 --> 00:07.720
Well, one thing we could do is apply

00:07.720 --> 00:09.840
your own criteria of knowledge.

00:09.840 --> 00:14.340
Maybe your criteria of knowledge is faith.

00:14.340 --> 00:16.880
Let's say it's specifically Christian faith.

00:16.880 --> 00:21.240
Okay, your knowledge claim meets that criterion.

00:21.240 --> 00:23.040
But that was a little easy.

00:23.040 --> 00:27.040
Anyone's knowledge claim is gonna meet their own criterion,

00:27.040 --> 00:28.560
you would normally think.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.920
So that surely can't be sufficient for knowledge.

00:31.920 --> 00:33.180
Here's another possibility.

00:33.180 --> 00:36.280
I'll apply another criterion, an external criterion.

00:36.280 --> 00:38.760
Knowledge is the deliverance of natural science.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.760
Natural science doesn't say anything about God,

00:42.760 --> 00:44.020
says Richard Dawkins.

00:44.900 --> 00:46.800
So therefore you don't know that God exists.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.680
That was also a little easy.

00:48.680 --> 00:50.880
It seemed totally questionable.

00:50.880 --> 00:52.960
So that's the glum of the criteria.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.720
Hegel's idea is that the first horn of the dilemma

00:55.720 --> 00:57.760
isn't actually so easy.

00:57.760 --> 01:01.800
Because in fact, these criteria,

01:01.800 --> 01:03.440
these conceptions of knowledge

01:03.440 --> 01:05.600
that natural consciousness generates

01:05.600 --> 01:10.180
are typically incoherence of their object.

01:10.180 --> 01:12.840
Now, you might ask, so one question you might have is,

01:12.840 --> 01:15.760
well, okay, but I can think of some conception of knowledge

01:15.760 --> 01:18.880
that isn't in the phenomenology of spirit that's coherent.

01:18.880 --> 01:21.120
But that isn't, so to speak,

01:21.120 --> 01:22.800
that isn't sort of argumentatively relevant

01:22.800 --> 01:24.560
to the phenomenology of spirit.

01:24.560 --> 01:26.840
The argument of phenomenology of spirit is if you just

01:26.880 --> 01:31.880
start out with the most primitive thing from itself,

01:32.680 --> 01:36.240
that will develop into knowledge that's so certain

01:36.240 --> 01:38.840
that no skeptical doubt about it can be raised.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.680
Okay, yeah, just one, and then we'll come on.

01:42.680 --> 01:47.680
So, if consciousness alters the standard of knowing,

01:48.520 --> 01:51.200
and then when the standard of knowing changes,

01:51.200 --> 01:54.360
it seems that so does the object that it knows.

01:54.560 --> 01:58.240
So that, how is there ever a one-on-one mapping

01:58.240 --> 02:01.160
of the object and the standard of knowing?

02:01.160 --> 02:02.360
How do they ever meet?

02:02.360 --> 02:04.640
When you change the object of knowing,

02:04.640 --> 02:06.120
you also change the knowledge

02:06.120 --> 02:08.000
that you need to know the object.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.560
And that's exactly what we're about to talk about.

02:10.560 --> 02:13.200
Paragraph 87, page 57.

02:13.200 --> 02:17.400
Okay, so for some reason that I actually don't really know,

02:17.400 --> 02:20.120
the phenomenology is always cited by paragraph numbers.

02:20.120 --> 02:25.120
So, in your papers, please cite it by paragraph number.

02:26.000 --> 02:31.000
And just because I want to drill into your mind,

02:31.800 --> 02:35.120
the fact that we are reading this at secondhand,

02:35.120 --> 02:37.240
you're reading it through translation,

02:37.240 --> 02:40.480
cite the marginal page numbers always,

02:40.480 --> 02:43.160
whenever they're given any of our translations.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.440
Because that's the sort of speak real thing.

02:45.440 --> 02:48.040
The page in Pinkert's translation is just,

02:48.040 --> 02:49.800
the page in what Terry Pinkert is telling you,

02:49.800 --> 02:50.640
they will say.

02:53.000 --> 02:58.000
In this exposition of the course of experience,

02:58.080 --> 03:01.800
there is a moment through which the exposition

03:01.800 --> 03:04.120
seems not to correspond

03:04.120 --> 03:07.040
with what is ordinarily understood by experience.

03:07.040 --> 03:08.160
Okay, let me just back up.

03:08.160 --> 03:09.280
I skipped something.

03:09.280 --> 03:10.760
This dialectical movement,

03:10.760 --> 03:13.320
which consciousness practices in its own self,

03:13.320 --> 03:15.120
this is 86,

03:15.120 --> 03:17.000
insofar as for consciousness,

03:17.000 --> 03:20.200
the new true object arises out of this movement

03:20.200 --> 03:22.800
is properly what is called experience.

03:22.800 --> 03:25.480
So Hegel's technical notion of experience

03:25.480 --> 03:28.840
is not when you took a gap year

03:28.840 --> 03:30.560
and traveled through Southeast Asia,

03:31.520 --> 03:36.040
nor is it the Kantian notion of a synthesis of perceptions,

03:36.040 --> 03:39.360
nor is it whatever Locke and Hume think about experience.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.880
It's precisely that.

03:40.880 --> 03:43.160
It's the dialectical movement

03:43.160 --> 03:45.280
by which consciousness realizes

03:45.280 --> 03:48.760
that its conception of knowledge is incoherent,

03:48.760 --> 03:50.840
that it's not a way of knowing the object

03:50.840 --> 03:52.440
that it takes itself to know

03:52.440 --> 03:55.160
and generates a new conception of knowledge

03:55.160 --> 03:56.880
and thereby generates a new conception

03:56.880 --> 03:58.360
of the object of knowledge.

03:58.360 --> 03:59.760
That's what experience is.

04:01.120 --> 04:01.960
Okay.

04:05.400 --> 04:06.480
Sorry, what?

04:06.480 --> 04:08.960
Can you say it's true or there?

04:08.960 --> 04:12.040
No, sorry.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.880
Okay, in this exposition,

04:13.960 --> 04:17.720
in this exposition of the course of experience,

04:17.720 --> 04:21.440
there is a moment through which the exposition

04:21.440 --> 04:23.000
seems not to correspond

04:23.000 --> 04:26.120
with what is ordinarily understood by experience.

04:26.120 --> 04:29.680
The transition, namely from the first object

04:29.680 --> 04:32.520
and the knowing of it to the other object

04:32.520 --> 04:36.400
about which one says that it is learned from experience

04:36.400 --> 04:38.560
was specified in such a way

04:38.560 --> 04:40.800
that the knowing of the first object

04:40.800 --> 04:44.200
or the being for consciousness of the first in itself

04:44.200 --> 04:47.640
is itself supposed to become the second object.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.240
So Hegel's referring back to some stuff that I skipped,

04:50.240 --> 04:51.960
so I'll just summarize it.

04:51.960 --> 04:55.680
So Hegel's idea is if this is the first,

04:55.680 --> 04:58.000
I'll just erase the thought bubble.

05:01.480 --> 05:02.880
I'll erase the thought bubble

05:02.880 --> 05:05.200
because the thought bubble is now just implied

05:05.200 --> 05:06.360
in everything I said.

05:06.360 --> 05:09.080
Everything that I, everything on the blackboard

05:09.080 --> 05:11.880
until further notice is the name of the thought bubble

05:11.880 --> 05:16.400
because the phenomenology is imminent to consciousness.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.920
We're not talking about objects themselves.

05:18.920 --> 05:22.240
We're talking about consciousness's conception of the object.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.840
What consciousness says is the object of knowledge.

05:26.040 --> 05:28.760
Not what we think the object is or what objects are.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.560
Okay.

05:31.560 --> 05:36.560
So Hegel has said, which he's now referring back to,

05:37.560 --> 05:40.680
is that if this is the first shape of consciousness,

05:42.160 --> 05:44.200
the new shape of consciousness

05:45.080 --> 05:47.400
is that what consciousness knows,

05:59.160 --> 06:04.160
the second object is the relationship

06:05.160 --> 06:10.160
of the consciousness to the object in the first shape.

06:15.920 --> 06:19.680
This relationship is what the object is.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.280
I should actually probably know.

06:25.320 --> 06:26.960
Okay.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.040
Now why isn't it?

06:29.800 --> 06:31.520
So let me give you an example.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.120
Here's an example.

06:36.440 --> 06:40.880
In Kant, the critique of theory is it begins

06:40.880 --> 06:43.800
with what Kant thinks of as the natural presupposition.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.680
I know things in themselves.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.520
And I do throw through sensing.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.280
That is, we're intuiting them.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.560
The argument of the transcendental aesthetic

07:03.560 --> 07:06.720
is that this does not relate you to things in themselves.

07:06.720 --> 07:08.400
You don't know things in themselves.

07:08.400 --> 07:11.280
You know their appearances to you.

07:11.280 --> 07:14.040
So what you know is not this,

07:14.040 --> 07:16.040
but how this relates to you

07:16.040 --> 07:18.360
and how it relates to you in this way.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.840
You know not this,

07:20.840 --> 07:23.120
but how this appears to you in intuition.

07:24.120 --> 07:28.880
So Hegel thinks when you find out that you don't know this,

07:29.000 --> 07:31.040
that this is not a way of knowing this,

07:32.600 --> 07:35.680
the next shape of consciousness is that what you know

07:37.200 --> 07:41.520
is that things relating to you in this way.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.240
So in the Kantian example,

07:44.240 --> 07:49.240
this would be the appearance of things in themselves.

07:54.560 --> 07:57.920
So you start out by claiming to know a certain object.

07:57.920 --> 08:01.360
Your knowing isn't a way of knowing that object.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.640
What it's a way of knowing

08:02.640 --> 08:05.840
is how that object relates to you in that relation.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.760
So that the second object is the relation

08:09.760 --> 08:13.440
of the first object to consciousness in the first form.

08:14.320 --> 08:17.880
Or it's the first relation of consciousness to the object.

08:20.520 --> 08:23.400
By contrast, it ordinarily seems that we learn

08:23.400 --> 08:26.720
from experience of the untruth of our first concept

08:26.720 --> 08:29.400
in another object that we perhaps come across

08:29.400 --> 08:31.720
serendipitously and extrinsically,

08:31.720 --> 08:34.720
that the only thing that is left to us

08:34.720 --> 08:38.320
is the pure grasping of what is in and for itself.

08:38.320 --> 08:43.320
Ordinarily we assume that we think we know stuff

08:43.520 --> 08:45.680
and then we come upon some other objects.

08:45.680 --> 08:49.320
We go explore and we're like oh,

08:49.320 --> 08:50.960
that's not what knowledge was,

08:50.960 --> 08:53.920
but that's a merely empirical case

08:53.920 --> 08:55.400
of undermining knowledge.

08:55.400 --> 08:59.280
We're interested in a sort of categorical collapse

08:59.280 --> 09:01.640
of an entire conception of knowledge,

09:01.640 --> 09:03.600
not some particular things of knowledge.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.480
That's like finding out that Fargo

09:05.480 --> 09:08.200
is not the capital of North Dakota.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.920
This observation of the matter is our addition,

09:11.920 --> 09:14.440
whereby this series of, sorry,

09:14.440 --> 09:17.000
however, based on the point of view given above,

09:17.000 --> 09:20.360
the new object shows itself to have come to be

09:20.360 --> 09:23.220
through a reversal of consciousness itself.

09:23.220 --> 09:27.740
So this new object is, it comes to be

09:27.740 --> 09:31.140
through the undermining of this shape of consciousness.

09:31.140 --> 09:32.900
Then there's a kicker.

09:32.900 --> 09:34.980
This observation of the matter,

09:34.980 --> 09:38.420
namely that the object of the second shape of consciousness

09:38.420 --> 09:42.060
is the first relation to the first object.

09:42.060 --> 09:43.980
It's the appearing of things of themselves,

09:43.980 --> 09:45.220
not things of themselves.

09:46.980 --> 09:51.780
This observation of the matter is our addition,

09:51.780 --> 09:54.140
whereby the series of experiences traversed

09:54.140 --> 09:57.540
by consciousness is elevated into a scientific progression

09:57.540 --> 10:00.400
and which is not there for the consciousness

10:00.400 --> 10:02.020
that we are observing.

10:02.020 --> 10:07.020
So this transition and the fact that the second object

10:08.020 --> 10:10.540
is the first relation to the first object

10:11.580 --> 10:15.840
is not, Hegel says, for consciousness.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.460
It is for us.

10:26.620 --> 10:28.140
What does that mean?

10:28.140 --> 10:32.520
What that means is that if we draw the thought bubble,

10:33.660 --> 10:38.020
this shape of consciousness conceives of itself

10:38.020 --> 10:41.100
as knowing this object in this way,

10:41.100 --> 10:43.580
but the fact that this object

10:43.580 --> 10:48.580
is the first relation to the first object

10:55.500 --> 10:58.980
is not something that it is in self-consciousness.

10:58.980 --> 11:01.260
That is to say, the shape of consciousness

11:01.260 --> 11:04.300
does not know that it arose from this.

11:04.300 --> 11:07.300
It's not constitutive of this shape of consciousness

11:07.300 --> 11:10.920
that it is aware of itself as the successor of this.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.900
Because why would it be?

11:12.900 --> 11:16.940
It's not constitutive to knowing this in this way

11:16.940 --> 11:20.940
that you know that you arose from that.

11:20.940 --> 11:22.720
This is our addition.

11:23.740 --> 11:25.660
So there's a distinction in the phenomenology,

11:25.660 --> 11:27.540
in every scene of the phenomenology,

11:27.540 --> 11:32.380
between what is for us and what is for consciousness.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.140
That is to say, there's a distinction between

11:34.140 --> 11:36.500
what we say about consciousness

11:36.500 --> 11:38.860
and what consciousness says about itself.

11:38.860 --> 11:40.920
And what consciousness says about itself

11:40.940 --> 11:42.760
has to always be imminently developed

11:42.760 --> 11:44.720
from consciousness itself.

11:44.720 --> 11:49.720
So the for us remarks can be preliminary

11:51.280 --> 11:53.640
or they can indicate the shape of the science,

11:53.640 --> 11:56.960
but they can't themselves be,

11:56.960 --> 11:59.080
they can't include the undermining.

12:01.080 --> 12:04.640
Otherwise, the imminence of the exposition would be.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.960
So what we do scientifically is order these things

12:10.040 --> 12:11.320
in this way.

12:11.320 --> 12:13.440
But that, this thing undermines itself

12:13.440 --> 12:15.200
is not something we do to it.

12:15.200 --> 12:16.320
It does it to itself.

12:17.340 --> 12:20.480
But we, what's sometimes referred to

12:20.480 --> 12:22.240
as the phenomenological observer,

12:22.240 --> 12:24.880
the reader and the author of the phenomenology,

12:24.880 --> 12:27.960
we order these shapes of consciousness in this way.

12:27.960 --> 12:30.160
And that generates a scientific development.

12:31.360 --> 12:34.040
So now we have a principled reason

12:34.040 --> 12:38.400
for the beginning, the order, and the end.

12:38.400 --> 12:40.420
And in any Hegelian science,

12:40.420 --> 12:43.320
you always have to ask yourself where it begins,

12:43.320 --> 12:46.320
what the principle of movement of it is,

12:46.320 --> 12:47.480
and where it ends.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.660
Okay, reading a little bit further.

12:51.660 --> 12:55.360
However, this is in fact also the same situation

12:55.360 --> 12:57.600
already discussed above concerning the relation

12:57.600 --> 12:59.680
of the exposition to skepticism.

12:59.680 --> 13:02.240
Namely, that each and every result which emerges

13:02.240 --> 13:05.040
from a non-truthful knowing should not coalesce

13:05.040 --> 13:06.600
into an empty nothing,

13:06.600 --> 13:08.520
but rather must necessarily be grasped

13:08.520 --> 13:11.760
as a nothing of that of which it is the result.

13:11.760 --> 13:13.680
A result which contains the truth

13:13.680 --> 13:16.760
that the previous knowing has within itself.

13:16.760 --> 13:21.120
So this result is not an abstract nothing.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.100
It's not just the giving up on knowledge.

13:23.100 --> 13:26.560
It's this determinant negation of this.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.600
It's, there's something it isn't.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.520
It isn't that.

13:31.040 --> 13:35.480
It's for us specifically not that shape of consciousness

13:35.480 --> 13:38.280
because that shape of consciousness undermined itself.

13:39.560 --> 13:44.560
And this relation is what Hegel calls being the truth of.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.520
So what that means is this,

13:58.520 --> 14:02.880
when it thinks itself fully undermines itself,

14:02.920 --> 14:07.920
and this is what resolves the problem in a principled way.

14:08.080 --> 14:11.600
So this contains whatever was true in this.

14:12.880 --> 14:17.880
Now that means truth is not on or off.

14:18.220 --> 14:19.720
Things are not true or not.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.680
Truth here is a relational notion,

14:22.680 --> 14:25.040
being the truth of something else.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.700
And so things can be more or less true.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.920
This is the truth of that.

14:28.920 --> 14:32.080
The third shape is the truth of the second shape.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.840
As we do this, we get truer and truer.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.760
Now truth for Hegel is gonna turn out to be

14:39.760 --> 14:43.060
the agreement of something with its concept.

14:44.240 --> 14:47.940
So what this is is,

14:55.200 --> 14:58.040
knowledge becoming more and more

14:58.040 --> 14:59.920
in agreement with its concept.

14:59.920 --> 15:02.000
Now what is the concept of knowledge?

15:02.800 --> 15:03.640
We don't know yet.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.600
It's up to consciousness to say.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.880
It's up to the exposition of the phenomenology

15:09.880 --> 15:13.120
to unfold from consciousness what the concept

15:13.120 --> 15:14.400
of knowledge is.

15:14.400 --> 15:17.000
If we just said what the concept of knowledge is

15:17.000 --> 15:20.400
from the beginning, we would be begging the question.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.400
We would be falling into the second form

15:22.400 --> 15:23.960
of the dilemma of the criteria.

15:25.320 --> 15:26.160
Yeah.

15:26.160 --> 15:28.520
Can you explain what it means for something

15:28.520 --> 15:31.580
to contain the truth of something else?

15:32.420 --> 15:34.420
In what sense does the thing on the left

15:34.420 --> 15:35.260
contain the truth of it?

15:35.260 --> 15:38.580
I mean in a certain way, this schematic diagram

15:38.580 --> 15:41.060
is all that can be said about that.

15:41.060 --> 15:44.960
What for something to contain the truth of something else

15:44.960 --> 15:49.960
is for it to be the principled successor to that.

15:51.780 --> 15:56.400
So X is the truth of Y if X is the principled successor

15:56.400 --> 16:00.460
of Y in virtue of Y negating itself.

16:02.540 --> 16:03.380
Yes.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.780
Yes, I have a question.

16:04.780 --> 16:06.620
You've been making a distinction between

16:06.620 --> 16:08.060
what we say about consciousness

16:08.060 --> 16:10.140
and what consciousness says for itself.

16:10.140 --> 16:15.140
But anything we assert as consciousness says for itself,

16:17.740 --> 16:19.700
we're saying it equals something.

16:19.700 --> 16:20.540
Sorry, say that again?

16:20.540 --> 16:21.540
Okay.

16:21.540 --> 16:24.780
So there's the distinction between what we say

16:24.780 --> 16:29.620
about consciousness, namely we order the past consciousness

16:29.660 --> 16:33.700
and what consciousness says for itself.

16:35.540 --> 16:38.860
But how can making this at all means

16:38.860 --> 16:42.540
whatever the wire gets cut by others?

16:42.540 --> 16:43.380
Yeah, okay.

16:43.380 --> 16:46.740
So by consciousness, Hegel doesn't mean

16:46.740 --> 16:48.300
like consciousness in general.

16:48.300 --> 16:50.660
He means by a particular shape of consciousness.

16:51.740 --> 16:53.300
Of course, we're conscious.

16:53.300 --> 16:56.900
But when Hegel refers to something as consciousness,

16:56.900 --> 17:00.660
he means it's consciousness and nothing more.

17:00.660 --> 17:03.500
Not, and this goes back to a point from earlier,

17:03.500 --> 17:07.460
not that it isn't in any way that further thing,

17:07.460 --> 17:10.260
but it hasn't yet grasped itself as that further thing.

17:11.560 --> 17:14.660
So Hegel won't call us consciousness,

17:14.660 --> 17:16.220
although of course we're conscious,

17:16.220 --> 17:18.180
because we are something more.

17:18.180 --> 17:21.540
In particular, insofar as you are reading

17:21.540 --> 17:22.860
the phenomenology of spirit,

17:22.860 --> 17:26.080
you're always one step ahead of a shape of consciousness.

17:26.080 --> 17:28.660
You always know something more than it about itself.

17:28.660 --> 17:31.040
So you are not merely identical

17:31.040 --> 17:32.780
with that shape of consciousness.

17:32.780 --> 17:35.560
So one way of distinguishing this

17:35.560 --> 17:38.520
is thinking about what a shape of consciousness

17:38.520 --> 17:41.040
is implicitly and what it is explicitly.

17:41.040 --> 17:42.560
All of these shapes of consciousness

17:42.560 --> 17:44.500
are implicitly spirit.

17:44.500 --> 17:47.180
They're implicitly absolute no.

17:47.180 --> 17:52.180
Because they contain in themselves the imminent criteria,

17:52.300 --> 17:54.880
which when thought through by themselves

17:54.880 --> 17:56.220
will lead to absolute no.

17:57.740 --> 17:59.840
But they are not explicitly absolute no.

18:01.080 --> 18:06.080
So we are, I'm more than just implicitly consciousness.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.280
I'm explicitly something more than consciousness.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.720
And so Hegel won't refer to me

18:12.720 --> 18:14.920
or himself as mere consciousness.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.360
Yeah.

18:17.360 --> 18:20.680
So choosing the successor of truth,

18:20.680 --> 18:22.760
it's like, for example,

18:22.760 --> 18:24.960
is there a absurd stage of consciousness?

18:24.960 --> 18:28.560
That's the truth of the first stage of consciousness,

18:28.560 --> 18:30.960
also preserved and disturbed in the system.

18:30.960 --> 18:31.800
Yes, yes.

18:31.800 --> 18:33.680
So the truth of is transitive.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.920
So we're going to try to figure that out.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.200
So you guys speak up.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.320
Oh, we're going to be trying to figure that distinction

18:41.320 --> 18:44.600
between consciousness as we felt a number more

18:44.600 --> 18:47.480
and consciousness, what we can claim about it,

18:47.480 --> 18:51.920
could be similar to how we can claim thought and object.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.400
So we are making claims about consciousness

18:54.400 --> 18:55.880
as it appears to us,

18:55.880 --> 18:58.880
just to speak between us making a claim about consciousness

18:58.880 --> 19:02.280
and consciousness as it's also looking more important.

19:02.280 --> 19:06.440
Yes, except that our claims about consciousness

19:06.440 --> 19:10.680
are not supposed to be one of the shapes of consciousness

19:10.680 --> 19:12.240
in this sequence.

19:12.240 --> 19:13.080
Thank you.

19:13.080 --> 19:14.760
Okay, let me just, let me just,

19:14.760 --> 19:16.720
let's just read a little bit further.

19:16.720 --> 19:19.560
However, this is in fact also the same situation

19:19.560 --> 19:21.600
already discussed above concerning the relation

19:21.640 --> 19:23.520
of this exposition to skepticism,

19:23.520 --> 19:24.800
namely that each and every result

19:24.800 --> 19:26.480
which emerges from a non-truthful known

19:26.480 --> 19:28.360
should not coalesce into an empty nothing.

19:28.360 --> 19:31.000
So not just the rejection of knowledge,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.840
but rather must be necessarily grasped

19:32.840 --> 19:35.120
as the nothing of that of which it is the result,

19:35.120 --> 19:36.720
or result which contains the truth

19:36.720 --> 19:39.040
that the previous knowing has within itself.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.120
Here it presents itself as follows.

19:41.120 --> 19:42.880
Well, what at first appeared as the object

19:42.880 --> 19:46.400
generating for consciousness into a knowing of the object,

19:46.400 --> 19:49.960
and in itself becomes a being for consciousness

19:49.960 --> 19:52.920
of the in itself, the latter is the new object,

19:52.920 --> 19:55.320
the being of consciousness for the in itself.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.280
That's this point.

19:57.280 --> 20:00.880
The being of consciousness for the object is the new object.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.240
The previous being of object,

20:03.240 --> 20:05.000
being of the object for consciousness,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
that's what this is, is the new object.

20:08.600 --> 20:12.320
As a result, a new shape of consciousness comes on the scene

20:12.320 --> 20:15.000
for which the essence is something different

20:15.000 --> 20:16.960
from what was the essence for the preceding shape.

20:16.960 --> 20:19.560
Okay, so let me just say something about the word essence.

20:19.560 --> 20:21.760
Hegel has this, the word here is vesen.

20:24.840 --> 20:27.960
So now vesen in German is more general

20:27.960 --> 20:32.120
than essence in English.

20:33.080 --> 20:37.520
It can be a being, like an entity can also be a vesen.

20:37.520 --> 20:42.520
So what Hegel means by vesen is whatever the standard

20:43.000 --> 20:46.480
of whatever it is that knowledge has to correspond to

20:46.480 --> 20:48.200
in order to count as knowledge.

20:48.200 --> 20:49.640
So you might think, well, isn't that just

20:49.640 --> 20:50.760
what the object is?

20:52.000 --> 20:54.240
Yes, at the beginning, but over the course

20:54.240 --> 20:57.080
of the phenomenology, something other than the object

20:57.080 --> 20:59.560
is going to come to count as the vesen.

20:59.560 --> 21:04.360
So the progress of the phenomenology is that consciousness,

21:04.360 --> 21:07.480
knowing something that's an object will turn out

21:07.480 --> 21:08.880
to be incoherent.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.800
And then the vesen will turn out to be the subject.

21:11.800 --> 21:14.880
It will turn out to be that what the subject has to do

21:14.880 --> 21:18.080
in order to know objects is come into an agreement

21:18.080 --> 21:19.520
with itself.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.360
But we're not going to actually read those sections

21:21.360 --> 21:22.880
of phenomenology.

21:22.880 --> 21:26.000
So just understand, vesen is like a functional term.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.800
It means whatever is that which knowledge has to correspond

21:29.800 --> 21:33.440
to or agree with in order to be knowledge.

21:33.440 --> 21:37.160
But for now, the object is playing the vesen term.

21:40.040 --> 21:44.160
And in fact, consciousness is more or less identified,

21:45.120 --> 21:49.160
or identical for Hegel, with a conception of knowledge

21:49.160 --> 21:52.120
with the object plays the role of vesen.

21:52.120 --> 21:55.680
Okay, this is what's so great about only teaching

21:55.680 --> 21:56.880
the easy parts of Hegel.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.280
In case you're wondering, this is like the easiest

22:01.280 --> 22:02.360
ten pages of Hegel.

22:03.800 --> 22:06.360
Okay, as a result of, if you guys go,

22:06.360 --> 22:07.600
oh, I don't know how I'm getting through this,

22:07.600 --> 22:11.720
like you have no idea, like it won't get that bad

22:11.720 --> 22:15.240
in this class, but it gets infinitely worse than this.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.840
As a result, a new shape of consciousness comes on the scene,

22:18.840 --> 22:21.200
you can already read that, is this circumstance

22:21.200 --> 22:24.280
which guides the whole series of shapes of consciousness

22:24.280 --> 22:25.680
in their necessity.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.280
So that's super crucial.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.280
The progression of the shapes of consciousness

22:31.280 --> 22:33.360
has to be necessary.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.560
There has to be no arbitrariness or contingency

22:36.560 --> 22:39.400
in one shape of consciousness being the successor

22:39.400 --> 22:40.560
to the previous one.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.720
That's why the merely historical reading

22:42.720 --> 22:44.880
of the phenomenology has to be wrong.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.480
The fact that one shape of consciousness

22:48.480 --> 22:51.120
historically succeeds another,

22:51.120 --> 22:55.120
it does not by itself demonstrate any necessity.

22:55.120 --> 22:58.320
So if all this were, were a super high level

22:58.320 --> 23:00.800
philosophical account of intellectual history,

23:00.800 --> 23:03.000
it would demonstrate nothing about necessity.

23:04.280 --> 23:08.880
What it could be, so there's like the pure historical reading,

23:08.880 --> 23:13.560
this is literally just a catalog of what happens in history

23:13.560 --> 23:16.040
but described in terms of historical period

23:16.040 --> 23:19.160
self conceptions, that can't be right.

23:19.160 --> 23:23.320
What it could be right is it's a description, it's that,

23:23.320 --> 23:27.000
plus each of those historically extant conceptions

23:27.000 --> 23:31.040
of knowledge incoherently undermines itself

23:31.040 --> 23:32.960
and necessitates the next one.

23:32.960 --> 23:36.800
So that's a little bit better, still wrong because A,

23:36.800 --> 23:38.360
Hegel explicitly says that it's false,

23:38.800 --> 23:41.080
the book ends, Hegel says something that's completely

23:41.080 --> 23:43.440
in the battle with that, which we will read.

23:43.440 --> 23:45.520
And furthermore, the chronology is wrong.

23:45.520 --> 23:49.280
In fact, Newtonian science occurred after the ancient Greeks.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.360
So, sorry guys, okay.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.320
There's very few pure historical readers

23:55.320 --> 23:57.040
of the phenomenology of the spirit left

23:57.040 --> 23:59.160
but I have like a bad reaction to this

23:59.160 --> 24:02.800
because I survived my first Hegel class partly

24:02.800 --> 24:06.200
by just ingesting Michael Forster's book

24:06.200 --> 24:07.960
about the phenomenology of the spirit.

24:08.400 --> 24:09.240
The first half of which is very good,

24:09.240 --> 24:11.000
it's all about Hegel's response to skepticism

24:11.000 --> 24:12.760
but the rest of which is just the pure intellectual

24:12.760 --> 24:15.480
distribution of phenomenology, which is very,

24:15.480 --> 24:17.560
which is bad in pernicious.

24:17.560 --> 24:20.320
However, it is just this necessity itself

24:20.320 --> 24:22.480
or the emergence of the new object

24:22.480 --> 24:25.040
which presents itself to consciousness

24:25.040 --> 24:28.880
without consciousness knowing how this happens to it.

24:28.880 --> 24:33.880
So this consciousness is unaware of its own history.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.920
Now at a certain point in the phenomenology,

24:36.920 --> 24:41.000
that will change and a shape of consciousness

24:41.000 --> 24:44.400
will become explicitly self-conscious

24:44.400 --> 24:47.120
of its development out of logically prior

24:47.120 --> 24:48.400
to self-consciousness.

24:48.400 --> 24:49.920
But we're not there yet.

24:52.920 --> 24:55.200
Through this, there enters into the movement

24:55.200 --> 24:58.160
of consciousness a moment of the in itself

24:58.160 --> 25:00.080
or of being for us.

25:00.080 --> 25:02.640
So this is a different use of in itself.

25:02.640 --> 25:06.420
So sometimes Hegel uses in itself to mean this.

25:07.120 --> 25:10.640
Sometimes what Hegel means but in itself

25:10.640 --> 25:15.640
is a contrast between what is in itself and for itself.

25:21.720 --> 25:25.240
And that approximately means what something

25:25.240 --> 25:30.240
implicitly is without grasping it.

25:32.600 --> 25:36.200
And for itself, what explicitly it is

25:37.920 --> 25:41.800
what it grasps itself as such.

25:43.440 --> 25:48.520
So let me give you an example.

25:53.880 --> 25:57.240
Let's use the standard bad movie, The Hero.

25:58.960 --> 26:03.960
Luke Skywalker is the savior of the galaxy

26:04.960 --> 26:09.960
and the savior of the Jedi in himself from the beginning.

26:10.640 --> 26:15.640
But only in Return of the Jedi is he that form himself.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.900
I shy away from Star Wars examples

26:18.900 --> 26:21.560
because I find that they're one of the few pieces

26:21.560 --> 26:26.000
of pop culture that I share, that I know,

26:26.000 --> 26:27.680
that my students also know.

26:27.680 --> 26:31.000
And so then I tend to use them too much.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.800
And then people think that I'm way more into Star Wars.

26:34.680 --> 26:38.200
So then I will try, I will try to use the Star Wars

26:38.200 --> 26:39.320
reference experiment.

26:41.160 --> 26:46.160
Theologically, Jesus is the son of God in himself

26:46.600 --> 26:49.580
before he takes on or accepts that identity.

26:49.580 --> 26:52.280
Then he is the son of God for himself.

26:54.960 --> 26:58.680
It is this circumstance, however it is just this necessity.

26:58.680 --> 27:02.480
So these shapes of consciousness are in themselves

27:03.840 --> 27:06.560
gauges on the path to absolute nothing.

27:06.560 --> 27:09.640
But they are not those for themselves

27:09.640 --> 27:11.800
because consciousness is not aware of that.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.720
And in the phenomenology, the in itself,

27:14.720 --> 27:19.400
but not for itself, can be identified with what is for us

27:19.400 --> 27:21.120
and not for consciousness.

27:21.120 --> 27:24.860
So in the phenomenology we can identify these risks,

27:24.860 --> 27:29.860
what is for us, and what is for consciousness.

27:34.280 --> 27:35.640
Okay.

27:35.640 --> 27:38.600
So just a note on Hegelian tactical terminology.

27:39.760 --> 27:42.560
People, I've had this experience multiple times

27:42.560 --> 27:43.400
that students would be like,

27:43.400 --> 27:44.880
I've been reading the phenomenology on my own

27:44.880 --> 27:45.800
and I totally get it.

27:45.800 --> 27:47.760
Could you just tell me though what the in itself

27:47.760 --> 27:49.360
and the for itself are?

27:49.360 --> 27:52.320
And the reason that question is very hard to answer

27:52.320 --> 27:54.520
and slightly frustrating to be asked

27:54.520 --> 27:58.640
is the meaning of Hegel's tactical terminology,

27:58.640 --> 28:01.240
like everything else, has to be developed

28:01.280 --> 28:03.480
imminently over the course of the science.

28:04.520 --> 28:07.520
So these are to some extent like my external remarks

28:07.520 --> 28:10.740
because I've read this book many times helping you along.

28:10.740 --> 28:14.240
But properly speaking, the meaning of the in itself

28:14.240 --> 28:16.400
or the for itself is going to change

28:16.400 --> 28:18.320
over the course of the phenomenology.

28:18.320 --> 28:20.000
So the only thing that we can say

28:20.000 --> 28:21.960
that's like genuinely true illuminating

28:21.960 --> 28:24.360
is some kind of like general structural features

28:24.360 --> 28:26.120
of how these terms are used.

28:26.120 --> 28:28.960
And in particular, when we get to the logic,

28:29.960 --> 28:32.000
I'll actually, the in itself is actually in the part

28:32.000 --> 28:33.320
of the logic we want to talk about.

28:33.320 --> 28:37.720
The logic develops in principle and purely imminently

28:37.720 --> 28:40.520
the pure technical meaning of these terms.

28:45.280 --> 28:47.000
Which does not present itself for the consciousness

28:47.000 --> 28:49.680
which is itself comprehended in the experience itself.

28:49.680 --> 28:52.420
However, the content of what emerges to us

28:52.420 --> 28:54.160
is for consciousness.

28:54.160 --> 28:56.800
And we comprehend only what is formal in it

28:56.800 --> 28:58.460
or its pure emergence.

28:58.480 --> 29:03.300
For consciousness, what is emerged is only as object.

29:03.300 --> 29:05.780
That is to say, what's emerged is an object

29:05.780 --> 29:07.140
that it claims to know.

29:07.140 --> 29:09.900
For us, what is emerged is that the same time emerges

29:09.900 --> 29:12.460
as movement and coming to be.

29:12.460 --> 29:16.380
But we understand this as having come to be from that.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.700
Well remember, movement is just the name

29:18.700 --> 29:22.260
for this purely conceptual process

29:22.260 --> 29:26.020
of one conception of knowledge undermining itself

29:26.020 --> 29:28.940
and giving rise purely logically to another.

29:28.940 --> 29:30.780
And this process and this movement

29:30.780 --> 29:32.180
is not happening in time.

29:33.700 --> 29:38.340
Okay, through this necessity, this path to science

29:38.340 --> 29:41.260
is itself already science.

29:43.180 --> 29:45.280
Earlier he said, this doesn't appear to be science,

29:45.280 --> 29:48.780
but now he's telling you, this is actually science.

29:48.780 --> 29:50.900
But we don't know what science is.

29:50.900 --> 29:54.660
So that is a provisional remark for something

29:54.660 --> 29:56.540
that will have to be proven by the end of the book.

29:56.540 --> 29:59.520
In fact, in doing the science of logic,

29:59.520 --> 30:01.140
sorry, the phonology of spirit,

30:01.140 --> 30:02.940
we are actually doing science.

30:02.940 --> 30:04.540
This is actually scientific now.

30:06.260 --> 30:08.860
And according to its content, it is thereby the science

30:08.860 --> 30:11.140
of the experience of consciousness.

30:11.140 --> 30:14.420
Okay, now those of you who pay very close attention,

30:14.420 --> 30:16.140
actually this may not have been in the reading,

30:16.140 --> 30:18.060
but if you have a copy of the book,

30:18.060 --> 30:21.380
you'll notice that the title page of this book

30:21.380 --> 30:24.180
is Science of the Experience of Consciousness.

30:24.180 --> 30:28.040
So if you look at this book, it has one title page

30:28.040 --> 30:32.340
that says, Phenomenology of Spirit,

30:32.340 --> 30:35.600
and then it has a preface and an introduction.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.860
And then there's another title page saying,

30:37.860 --> 30:40.020
Science of the Experience of Consciousness.

30:40.020 --> 30:42.260
Why does this book have two titles?

30:42.260 --> 30:45.260
The reason is that the original title of this book

30:45.260 --> 30:48.160
was the Science of the Experience of Consciousness.

30:48.160 --> 30:51.680
Halfway through the book, Hegel decided

30:51.680 --> 30:53.740
that it needed a second half

30:53.740 --> 30:55.060
and that it should bear the title,

30:55.060 --> 30:57.020
Phenomenology of Spirit.

30:57.020 --> 31:00.060
The problem is the first half of the book had been printed.

31:01.420 --> 31:03.220
And in the early 19th century,

31:03.220 --> 31:05.580
paper is very, very valuable.

31:05.580 --> 31:10.580
So the printer was not gonna pulp half of a book.

31:13.060 --> 31:16.540
So instead, they printed the rest of the book

31:16.540 --> 31:18.160
with the original title page

31:18.160 --> 31:20.340
and then just added another title page.

31:20.340 --> 31:21.180
And you can in fact,

31:21.220 --> 31:23.300
that card first has proven this

31:23.300 --> 31:28.020
by examining the very most original first editions

31:28.020 --> 31:29.620
of the Phenomenology of Spirit.

31:29.620 --> 31:31.500
So here at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library,

31:31.500 --> 31:33.420
we have one of the very early editions,

31:33.420 --> 31:35.300
but there were even earlier ones.

31:35.300 --> 31:37.140
This is maybe boring, but it's extremely interesting

31:37.140 --> 31:39.580
to me, so I'm gonna bore you with it.

31:39.580 --> 31:41.540
There was a practice.

31:41.540 --> 31:45.940
So book publishers were also booksellers in,

31:45.940 --> 31:48.860
sorry, printers were also booksellers

31:49.500 --> 31:51.260
in the early 19th century.

31:51.260 --> 31:55.780
So a publisher or a printer that was publishing a book,

31:55.780 --> 31:58.140
you could subscribe to that book

31:58.140 --> 32:01.780
and they would send you the parts of the book

32:01.780 --> 32:03.620
as they were getting printed.

32:03.620 --> 32:06.900
So an 18th century book is printed

32:06.900 --> 32:08.380
on these gigantic pieces of paper

32:08.380 --> 32:11.860
that are folded together and then they print off them.

32:11.860 --> 32:14.340
You could subscribe and as those got printed,

32:14.340 --> 32:15.860
they would send them to you.

32:15.860 --> 32:18.180
And then when the whole thing was done,

32:18.180 --> 32:20.860
you would send it back, they would bind it together

32:20.860 --> 32:22.460
and then you'd have your book.

32:22.460 --> 32:25.420
And so Eckhart first found one of these

32:25.420 --> 32:27.100
of the Phenomenology of Spirit

32:27.100 --> 32:31.100
and he proved on the basis of the folds of the page

32:31.100 --> 32:36.100
that the original first fold of the Phenomenology of Spirit

32:36.780 --> 32:40.540
has the title, Science of the Experience of Consciousness

32:40.540 --> 32:44.300
and then when they asked for everybody's folds back,

32:44.300 --> 32:46.400
they cut off a couple of pages

32:46.400 --> 32:48.200
and then added the rest of it.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.560
And he has a claim about these various pages

32:50.560 --> 32:54.000
in Hegel's not lost the papers that were left

32:54.000 --> 32:57.160
over his death about what those missing pages are.

32:57.160 --> 32:58.280
This unfortunately is not something

32:58.280 --> 32:59.840
we're gonna be able to cover in this class.

32:59.840 --> 33:01.920
Now I realize that this may be very sad.

33:01.920 --> 33:06.920
Okay, so why did he go from calling it

33:08.080 --> 33:10.680
a science of the experience of consciousness

33:10.680 --> 33:12.280
to the Phenomenology of Spirit?

33:13.320 --> 33:16.200
Because the original plan of the book

33:16.360 --> 33:21.360
is that it ends, so the book was originally supposed

33:21.720 --> 33:26.720
to contain consciousness, self-consciousness,

33:33.320 --> 33:34.160
and reason.

33:37.640 --> 33:42.640
Spirit is where the, this is the original plan.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.200
This is the original plan.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.520
This is something called the Four Phenomenology.

33:46.520 --> 33:48.840
This is where the second half of the book starts.

33:48.840 --> 33:50.720
So the original plan of the book

33:50.720 --> 33:52.760
didn't have the spirit section.

33:52.760 --> 33:56.960
So then for some reason, Hegel decided

33:56.960 --> 33:59.960
the book needed a second half

33:59.960 --> 34:03.840
that includes spirit, religion, and absolute damage.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.560
Yeah, spirit, religion, and absolute damage.

34:08.560 --> 34:13.560
And he decided that what the whole thing is

34:18.480 --> 34:21.640
is not just the science of the experience of consciousness

34:21.640 --> 34:23.440
but the Phenomenology of Spirit.

34:29.680 --> 34:32.480
So really, this is what was originally

34:32.480 --> 34:34.880
the science of the experience of consciousness.

34:35.880 --> 34:38.000
So now it's possible, and this is the kind of thing

34:38.000 --> 34:39.360
that we would have to deal with

34:39.360 --> 34:41.440
if we were doing a class of the whole Phenomenology,

34:41.440 --> 34:44.680
that this description of the project of the Phenomenology

34:44.680 --> 34:46.640
applies only to this.

34:46.640 --> 34:49.760
And then, imminently, within the reason section,

34:49.760 --> 34:52.960
we transition to a different project.

34:52.960 --> 34:56.600
I don't think that's quite right, but regardless,

34:56.600 --> 34:57.800
what does it mean that the whole thing

34:57.800 --> 34:59.240
is a Phenomenology of Spirit?

34:59.240 --> 35:00.840
Okay, so now this goes back to a question

35:00.840 --> 35:02.040
that was asked earlier.

35:04.200 --> 35:05.400
Who asked this question?

35:05.400 --> 35:07.280
The meeting of Phenomenology.

35:07.320 --> 35:08.520
Yes, Isaac, okay.

35:08.520 --> 35:12.400
So Phenomenology, right, just linguistically,

35:13.720 --> 35:17.080
means the logos of Phenomena.

35:18.000 --> 35:20.360
Oh, this board is really messy, I apologize for that.

35:20.360 --> 35:22.880
But it might just, you know, they do not need to,

35:22.880 --> 35:26.280
they do not need to add weight for this.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.640
Okay, Phenomenology.

35:37.280 --> 35:42.280
This is the logos, or the rational account of Phenomena,

35:52.000 --> 35:53.080
of Appearance.

35:55.320 --> 36:00.320
So this is the science of the Appearance of Spirit.

36:00.320 --> 36:05.320
So it's the scientific account of how Spirit appears

36:10.800 --> 36:15.440
up until, or up and until, Spirit is fully

36:15.440 --> 36:16.880
in and for itself.

36:16.880 --> 36:20.000
It's fully explicit for itself that it's Spirit.

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Now, what is the appearance of Spirit?

36:22.000 --> 36:24.520
It's not like Spirit is, it's the appearance

36:24.520 --> 36:26.160
of Spirit to Spirit.

36:26.160 --> 36:30.640
It's the appearance of Spirit to consciousness.

36:30.640 --> 36:34.560
Consciousness is ever more adequate conception

36:34.560 --> 36:35.760
of itself as Spirit.

36:37.440 --> 36:38.960
So this is what I was talking about before.

36:38.960 --> 36:42.720
That means consciousness is ever more truthful,

36:42.720 --> 36:45.560
ever more adequate conception of it not being

36:45.560 --> 36:47.880
fundamentally different from anything else.

36:47.880 --> 36:51.200
Of there not being anything that's radically distinct

36:51.200 --> 36:52.040
from Spirit.

36:52.040 --> 36:53.440
There's no outside to Spirit.

36:53.440 --> 36:55.320
There are things that are distinct from Spirit,

36:55.360 --> 36:56.800
but their fundamental structure is the same

36:56.800 --> 36:58.040
as the structure of Spirit.

36:58.040 --> 37:00.560
And so all of being, all of reality is in principle

37:00.560 --> 37:01.760
transparent to Spirit.

37:01.760 --> 37:04.040
It's in principle transparent to knowing.

37:04.040 --> 37:08.840
Okay, so that means that this introduction

37:08.840 --> 37:11.720
is not an introduction to the Phenomenology of Spirit.

37:11.720 --> 37:13.680
It's an introduction to the science of the Experience

37:13.680 --> 37:15.120
of Consciousness.

37:15.120 --> 37:16.960
That's why there's no explanation of why it's called

37:16.960 --> 37:18.360
a Phenomenology of Spirit.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.360
Although there is an explanation of why it's the science

37:20.360 --> 37:22.160
of the Experience of Consciousness.

37:23.080 --> 37:26.480
And it means that something really important happened

37:26.480 --> 37:29.600
because Hegel decided that the book could not end here.

37:30.720 --> 37:33.680
So once again, in a complete account of the Phenomenology

37:33.680 --> 37:35.920
of Spirit, we would have to,

37:35.920 --> 37:38.520
this transition is really crucial.

37:38.520 --> 37:40.560
Why does the book not end with reason?

37:40.560 --> 37:42.160
Why does it move to Spirit?

37:42.160 --> 37:44.360
And what is the particular nature of Spirit?

37:46.600 --> 37:50.320
Okay, so let's just do the last paragraph.

37:50.320 --> 37:52.800
The experience through which consciousness learns

37:52.800 --> 37:55.800
about itself can, according to its concept,

37:55.800 --> 37:58.560
comprehend within itself nothing less

37:58.560 --> 38:01.040
than the whole system of consciousness.

38:01.040 --> 38:04.440
Okay, so this is an obsession of German philosophy

38:04.440 --> 38:08.200
between Kant and Hegel, the systematicity of science.

38:08.200 --> 38:09.840
So we don't wanna just have science.

38:09.840 --> 38:11.360
Science has to be a system.

38:11.360 --> 38:14.520
However, Hegel hasn't imminently justified

38:14.520 --> 38:16.000
the notion of system.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.160
That he's gonna have to do.

38:18.160 --> 38:20.520
So this is a provisional remark

38:20.520 --> 38:21.840
for something that's gonna come.

38:21.840 --> 38:24.760
And we'll talk about when we get to Hegel's system,

38:24.760 --> 38:26.160
in what way it's systematic.

38:27.040 --> 38:28.840
Nothing less than the whole system of consciousness

38:28.840 --> 38:30.880
or the whole realm of the truth of spirit.

38:30.880 --> 38:33.040
So the moments of truth present themselves

38:33.040 --> 38:35.200
in this, their proper determinateness,

38:35.200 --> 38:37.440
not as being abstract pure moments,

38:37.440 --> 38:40.080
but rather in the way that they are for consciousness

38:40.080 --> 38:42.160
or in the way that consciousness itself comes

38:42.160 --> 38:44.040
on the scene in relation to that.

38:44.040 --> 38:46.520
In this way, the moments of the whole

38:46.520 --> 38:48.120
are shapes of consciousness.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.240
So the moments of the whole are the individual aspects

38:51.240 --> 38:53.160
or parts of this development

38:53.160 --> 38:56.040
from natural consciousness to absolute known.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.120
By consciousness carrying a word

38:58.120 --> 38:59.960
on towards its true existence,

38:59.960 --> 39:02.800
it will reach a point where it sets aside

39:02.800 --> 39:06.400
its semblance of being burdened with what is alien.

39:06.400 --> 39:10.240
So the end point of the phenomenology is willing to be

39:10.240 --> 39:13.680
in part giving up what Hegel here describes

39:13.680 --> 39:17.480
as a semblance, the idea that consciousness is burdened

39:17.480 --> 39:20.320
with an object distinct from itself that it has to know.

39:21.280 --> 39:23.320
Absolute knowing, as I said before,

39:23.320 --> 39:25.960
is gonna involve some kind of getting rid

39:25.960 --> 39:27.480
of the distinctness of the object

39:27.480 --> 39:30.280
or a collapse of the subject and the object together

39:30.280 --> 39:32.400
so that no possible distinction

39:32.400 --> 39:34.400
between subject and object can arise

39:34.400 --> 39:37.240
that would generate the skeptical problems

39:37.240 --> 39:39.480
that undermine previous shapes of consciousness.

39:40.960 --> 39:44.080
A point where the appearance becomes equal to the essence,

39:44.080 --> 39:46.800
the essence being that which has to be known,

39:46.800 --> 39:49.360
the appearance being its relationship to consciousness,

39:49.360 --> 39:53.160
so that its own exposition coincides at this very point

39:53.160 --> 39:55.640
with the genuine science of spirit

39:55.640 --> 40:00.440
so that this exposition will itself also have been,

40:00.440 --> 40:04.440
will turn out to be a scientific knowing of what spirit is.

40:04.440 --> 40:07.480
Finally, while itself grasping this, its own essence,

40:07.480 --> 40:09.560
consciousness will signify the nature

40:09.560 --> 40:11.220
of absolute knowing itself.

40:11.220 --> 40:13.920
So just to anticipate slightly spoiler alert,

40:14.840 --> 40:18.360
this joke that people like to make on Twitter,

40:18.360 --> 40:21.000
the real journey, the real destination

40:21.000 --> 40:22.840
was the friends we made along the way.

40:22.840 --> 40:27.440
This is in a certain way the key idea of Hegel.

40:27.440 --> 40:30.480
Or the slightly less jokey version,

40:30.480 --> 40:32.240
the journey is the destination.

40:32.240 --> 40:35.960
That in a certain way, I'll try to justify this philosophically

40:35.960 --> 40:37.080
over the course of this semester

40:37.080 --> 40:38.720
and make this not sound so silly.

40:38.720 --> 40:41.320
That in a certain way is the key idea of Hegel.

40:41.320 --> 40:46.320
That actually, what absolute knowing is going to be,

40:46.680 --> 40:49.680
is going to turn out to be what we've been doing all along.

40:51.720 --> 40:53.920
So the end of the phenomenology of spirit,

40:53.920 --> 40:55.760
the end of all of Hegel's books

40:55.760 --> 40:57.720
have this weird, dissatisfying character.

40:57.720 --> 41:00.600
You're like, wait, I wanted to know what absolute knowing was.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.040
Why can't you tell me?

41:02.040 --> 41:05.640
And the answer is, you've been owning absolutely all along.

41:05.640 --> 41:08.400
But you've been absolutely knowing in itself.

41:09.360 --> 41:12.160
At the end, you have absolute knowledge for itself.

41:12.160 --> 41:14.840
You absolutely, you explicitly grasp

41:14.840 --> 41:17.440
what you've been doing all along as absolute knowing.

41:19.760 --> 41:22.240
And that is one of the reasons,

41:22.240 --> 41:25.080
if the journey is the destination,

41:25.080 --> 41:29.080
then the content of Hegel's philosophy,

41:29.080 --> 41:33.000
the P in Hegel, is the way you get to the P.

41:34.800 --> 41:36.640
They're inseparable.

41:36.680 --> 41:39.160
Which means Hegel cannot cut to the chase.

41:40.480 --> 41:44.480
That means there's no way for Hegel to communicate

41:44.480 --> 41:47.640
the so-called content of Hegel's thought,

41:47.640 --> 41:49.760
other than by you doing it yourself.

41:51.360 --> 41:54.520
That is why the books are so hard to read.

41:54.520 --> 41:58.440
You have to rethink every of Hegel's ideas

41:58.440 --> 42:00.880
in order to understand every one of the claims.

42:02.200 --> 42:04.800
There's no choice in reading Hegel,

42:04.800 --> 42:09.320
but to recapitulate the thought of Hegel

42:10.320 --> 42:12.720
in grasping the thought of Hegel.

42:12.720 --> 42:15.360
If there was a distinction between form and content,

42:15.360 --> 42:19.440
there could be P, and there could be my argument that P,

42:19.440 --> 42:21.240
and those would be different things.

42:22.320 --> 42:24.320
But for Hegel, they're one and the same.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.520
Which means that they aren't a value of P.

42:28.520 --> 42:31.680
Because P cannot be identical to an argument that P.

42:31.680 --> 42:34.520
I mean, it's a very bad argument that P.

42:35.160 --> 42:37.120
I mean, it's a value, right?

42:37.120 --> 42:40.200
And for many values of P, it is sound as well.

42:40.200 --> 42:42.680
But still, a very valid argument.

42:42.680 --> 42:46.280
So in some sense, where the phenomenology of spirit

42:46.280 --> 42:51.280
is going to end is that this has been absolute knowing

42:52.560 --> 42:53.400
all along.

42:55.080 --> 42:56.800
Sounds super weird, sounds kind of oaky,

42:56.800 --> 42:58.240
sounds slightly new-agey.

42:58.240 --> 43:00.600
But I hope that I will be able to false off and justify it

43:00.600 --> 43:02.840
as not totally stupid over the course of this much.

43:02.840 --> 43:04.800
Okay, we have some time.

43:04.800 --> 43:07.120
I just want to say, those who have taken classes

43:07.120 --> 43:10.320
with me before know that I tend not to keep to the syllabus,

43:10.320 --> 43:11.960
I tend to slow down.

43:11.960 --> 43:13.400
I think in my entire life,

43:13.400 --> 43:16.400
I have never actually kept to a syllabus.

43:16.400 --> 43:20.360
I think one time, I only was like one week behind,

43:20.360 --> 43:21.960
or even like half a week behind.

43:23.320 --> 43:25.960
It's possible that I will slow down from the syllabus.

43:26.960 --> 43:28.920
But there is, I have in my mind,

43:28.920 --> 43:32.020
a kind of condensed version where we can speed

43:32.060 --> 43:33.260
through certain things,

43:33.260 --> 43:35.740
and we'll still start at the beginning and get to the end.

43:35.740 --> 43:40.380
So we'll see the big structure of Hegel's system,

43:40.380 --> 43:41.940
even if we speed through certain things

43:41.940 --> 43:43.780
or slow down on other things.

43:43.780 --> 43:44.820
Questions?

43:44.820 --> 43:45.660
Yes.

43:45.660 --> 43:49.180
So when they say P is the right to get to the P,

43:49.180 --> 43:51.220
so what's the meaning of experience?

43:52.660 --> 43:57.540
Experience is, as Hegel says,

43:57.540 --> 44:02.020
consciousness undermining one's conception of knowledge,

44:02.020 --> 44:04.580
which gives rise to another conception of knowledge.

44:04.580 --> 44:07.100
That's what experience is.

44:07.100 --> 44:10.460
In a certain way, absolute knowing

44:10.460 --> 44:13.020
is not the experience of consciousness,

44:13.020 --> 44:15.460
but the science of the experience of consciousness.

44:15.460 --> 44:19.400
It's that experience in its systematic totalitarian,

44:19.400 --> 44:23.620
a principled beginning, a principled law of the series,

44:23.620 --> 44:25.060
and a principled end.

44:25.060 --> 44:25.900
Yeah.

44:25.940 --> 44:29.060
So is consciousness here a proper noun,

44:29.060 --> 44:31.140
like as you're referring to an entity,

44:31.140 --> 44:33.860
or is it just a functional world,

44:33.860 --> 44:38.860
like in point to that you're conscious of something

44:38.900 --> 44:42.380
that's like a function, not like an entity by itself?

44:43.580 --> 44:47.260
I mean, my inclination is to respond to you

44:47.260 --> 44:49.500
by saying that that's a false dichotomy,

44:49.500 --> 44:51.700
because functions are entities,

44:51.700 --> 44:55.100
and consciousness is definitely a noun, just grammatically.

44:55.220 --> 44:56.380
But I feel like there's something

44:56.380 --> 44:58.180
that's more behind your question.

44:58.180 --> 45:01.700
So what lies behind this question?

45:01.700 --> 45:06.380
So what lies behind the question is that if consciousness

45:06.380 --> 45:10.380
is just a functional world and just a status that I just,

45:10.380 --> 45:12.300
that something is always cognizing,

45:12.300 --> 45:14.380
or like conscious of something,

45:14.380 --> 45:18.620
and that process is like constantly rebooting itself,

45:18.620 --> 45:21.220
and it's not aware that it's even clear of itself,

45:21.220 --> 45:23.460
so it's always for itself.

45:23.620 --> 45:26.620
If consciousness is a proper noun,

45:26.620 --> 45:29.060
as like you're referring to an entity,

45:29.060 --> 45:32.740
then it can sort of like have passed and recognize

45:32.740 --> 45:36.260
the always immediately present in the world.

45:36.260 --> 45:37.700
Okay, so what I would say is,

45:37.700 --> 45:40.060
we're talking about consciousness,

45:40.060 --> 45:42.660
we're not talking about particular conscious subject.

45:42.660 --> 45:43.900
Why are we doing that?

45:43.900 --> 45:46.180
Because we're not interested in this conscious subject

45:46.180 --> 45:47.540
or that conscious subject,

45:47.540 --> 45:50.140
we're interested in what consciousness is.

45:50.140 --> 45:53.140
Okay, now, so we're at one level

45:53.140 --> 45:54.780
above individual conscious subject.

45:56.260 --> 46:00.300
Furthermore, consciousness is relational.

46:00.300 --> 46:03.580
Consciousness is consciousness of something else.

46:03.580 --> 46:07.620
In fact, even consciousness will turn into self-consciousness,

46:08.540 --> 46:11.420
which does not mean that consciousness is not self-conscious

46:11.420 --> 46:12.780
in the ordinary sense from the beginning,

46:12.780 --> 46:15.220
because as you see, consciousness has a conception

46:15.220 --> 46:16.900
of itself as consciousness.

46:16.900 --> 46:19.500
That is to say, in the ordinary sense, it's self-conscious.

46:19.500 --> 46:21.220
So we're not gonna read in this class

46:21.220 --> 46:23.500
the transition from consciousness to self-consciousness.

46:23.500 --> 46:25.780
But there's this thing that people,

46:25.780 --> 46:27.500
there's this reading that you sometimes hear

46:27.500 --> 46:31.180
where somehow, human beings were not conscious

46:31.180 --> 46:32.580
until they started fighting each other

46:32.580 --> 46:34.500
and then they became self-conscious,

46:34.500 --> 46:35.820
which is always very strict,

46:35.820 --> 46:38.700
because animals manage to fight each other.

46:38.700 --> 46:40.860
You look at them without being self,

46:40.860 --> 46:43.020
put two babies together, they won't fight each other,

46:43.020 --> 46:44.100
like wrestle with each other,

46:44.100 --> 46:46.340
but that's not turned them into self,

46:46.340 --> 46:47.820
makes them self-conscious.

46:47.900 --> 46:51.140
Of self-consciousness as the second part

46:51.140 --> 46:52.500
of the phenomenal energy of spirit

46:52.500 --> 46:55.180
does not refer to self-consciousness

46:55.180 --> 46:56.460
in the ordinary sense,

46:56.460 --> 47:00.100
but the idea that what consciousness is of,

47:00.100 --> 47:01.420
what knowledge is of,

47:02.860 --> 47:05.340
the essence that makes knowledge knowledge

47:05.340 --> 47:07.300
is consciousness is knowledge of itself.

47:08.900 --> 47:10.620
So that consciousness,

47:10.620 --> 47:13.900
it sort of speaks self-conscious knowledge of objects.

47:13.900 --> 47:14.980
What it needs to know,

47:14.980 --> 47:17.420
what it needs to match its representation to

47:17.540 --> 47:18.940
is the object.

47:18.940 --> 47:23.740
Self-consciousness is self-conscious knowledge of itself.

47:23.740 --> 47:26.820
What it needs to match its representation to is itself,

47:26.820 --> 47:29.340
including its representations of objects.

47:29.340 --> 47:31.940
So consciousness for Hegel,

47:31.940 --> 47:34.180
even self-consciousness is always relational,

47:35.100 --> 47:36.900
even if it's a relation to itself.

47:36.900 --> 47:39.700
So in that sense, maybe that's what you mean by functional.

47:41.020 --> 47:44.540
Consciousness is not, so to speak, an intrinsic property.

47:44.700 --> 47:48.260
Does your ever-subscribing impact on Hegel's ideal

47:48.260 --> 47:49.940
implicit and explicit?

47:49.940 --> 47:50.780
Yes.

47:50.780 --> 47:53.500
Hegel says at the beginning of the philosophy of spirit

47:53.500 --> 47:55.980
that the only thing worth reading about mind,

47:55.980 --> 47:58.860
aside from, of course, him, is Aristotle's Diana.

48:00.860 --> 48:01.700
Maybe not the only thing,

48:01.700 --> 48:03.900
the best thing ever given by the mind is Diana.

48:03.900 --> 48:05.620
So Hegel thinks of himself,

48:05.620 --> 48:07.180
Hegel's attitude towards true philosophy,

48:07.180 --> 48:09.540
which we will get to at the end of the course,

48:09.540 --> 48:13.660
is that the history of philosophy is,

48:13.980 --> 48:16.700
all of these things that we're gonna describe in Hegel,

48:16.700 --> 48:20.460
so there is a, one of the many distorted ways

48:20.460 --> 48:22.260
in which Hegel has been received

48:22.260 --> 48:23.940
is to think of Hegel as fundamentally

48:23.940 --> 48:25.140
a philosopher of history.

48:26.220 --> 48:27.860
Hegel is a philosopher of history.

48:27.860 --> 48:29.740
Maybe, probably the best,

48:29.740 --> 48:32.340
deepest philosopher of history ever.

48:32.340 --> 48:35.460
But the stuff that we're talking about is not historical.

48:35.460 --> 48:38.300
The fundamental stuff in Hegel is not historical.

48:38.300 --> 48:41.340
So the logic is not about history.

48:41.340 --> 48:43.620
The logic is not about historical categories,

48:44.460 --> 48:46.620
the development of the logic is not historical or temple.

48:46.620 --> 48:49.260
It's eternal outside of time.

48:49.260 --> 48:53.980
But Hegel thinks those eternal metaphysical logical

48:53.980 --> 48:58.420
structures are realized over time

48:58.420 --> 49:00.860
in human history in philosophy.

49:01.900 --> 49:04.580
So what the history of philosophy is,

49:04.580 --> 49:08.740
is the history of philosophers grasping

49:08.740 --> 49:13.420
incompletely mutilated non-systematic parts

49:13.420 --> 49:16.540
of the complete systematic self-development

49:16.540 --> 49:18.380
of non-physical categories.

49:18.380 --> 49:21.740
So once you have Hegel's logic on board,

49:21.740 --> 49:24.420
you can then look back through the history of philosophy

49:24.420 --> 49:27.820
and see aspects of it manifest themselves

49:27.820 --> 49:31.500
in Parmenides, Heraclitus, Plato, Aristotle, et cetera.

49:31.500 --> 49:33.340
Hegel is very dismissive of the medieval

49:33.340 --> 49:35.180
in his lecture of the history of philosophy.

49:35.180 --> 49:36.780
And then there were some medieval.

49:36.780 --> 49:38.540
Let's ignore that.

49:39.260 --> 49:40.820
Let's start up with Descartes, okay?

49:40.820 --> 49:43.620
And really just get to the Germans as quickly as possible.

49:45.500 --> 49:49.700
And so Hegel's, we're gonna end the class

49:49.700 --> 49:51.260
by reading a little bit of Hegel's lectures

49:51.260 --> 49:52.380
on the history of philosophy.

49:52.380 --> 49:55.220
Hegel thinks to confirm this theory,

49:55.220 --> 49:57.780
you have to go back through the history of philosophy

49:57.780 --> 50:01.020
and see this self-developing system

50:01.020 --> 50:04.100
of metaphysical structures, which is called the idea.

50:04.100 --> 50:07.540
You have to see it present in the history of philosophy,

50:07.540 --> 50:10.700
just as you have to see in the history of art,

50:10.700 --> 50:12.420
you have to find in the history of art

50:12.420 --> 50:14.620
the artistic presentation of the idea,

50:14.620 --> 50:17.740
the presentation of the idea in pictures

50:17.740 --> 50:20.620
and sculptures and music, et cetera.

50:20.620 --> 50:22.820
And you have to find in the history of religion

50:22.820 --> 50:25.020
the religious presentation of the idea,

50:25.020 --> 50:28.860
the presentation of the idea in mythology,

50:28.860 --> 50:33.860
in spiritual practice, in holy scriptures, et cetera.

50:33.940 --> 50:35.180
Yeah?

50:35.220 --> 50:37.980
What would be the tell-off of history?

50:37.980 --> 50:38.820
Of what?

50:39.820 --> 50:40.660
Of history?

50:40.660 --> 50:45.860
No, of his system, like the ultimate.

50:45.860 --> 50:46.700
The short answer is-

50:46.700 --> 50:48.660
The historian says the ultimate form,

50:48.660 --> 50:50.100
like the perfect open form.

50:50.100 --> 50:52.460
Reason fully and entirely grasping,

50:52.460 --> 50:53.900
that's all the best reason.

50:55.140 --> 50:56.220
Yeah?

50:56.220 --> 50:58.300
So when history uses phenomenology-

50:58.300 --> 50:59.340
Oh, excellent, yeah, I didn't answer

50:59.340 --> 51:00.980
the original question, yeah, thank you.

51:00.980 --> 51:04.260
So yeah, so the phenomenology in Hegel

51:04.260 --> 51:09.260
is just the science of how science appears,

51:11.820 --> 51:16.820
that is to say, shapes of apparent claims

51:17.180 --> 51:19.020
to knowledge that are not knowledge.

51:19.020 --> 51:20.820
So the science of the experience of consciousness

51:20.820 --> 51:23.700
could also be called the phenomenology of knowledge.

51:23.700 --> 51:26.780
And the phenomenology of spirit is the logos,

51:26.780 --> 51:29.820
the science of how spirit appears to itself

51:29.820 --> 51:31.940
as things that are not yet spirit.

51:31.940 --> 51:36.820
It's spirit in itself but not yet for itself.

51:36.820 --> 51:41.620
It's the scientific exposition of the stages of spirit

51:41.620 --> 51:43.380
in itself but not yet for itself

51:43.380 --> 51:45.780
up to and including spirit in and for itself.

51:47.420 --> 51:51.380
Phenomenology in Husserl is this idea

51:51.380 --> 51:53.620
that what first philosophy should be,

51:53.620 --> 51:58.500
the replacement for metaphysics should be a science

51:58.500 --> 52:02.020
where you just bracket the question

52:02.020 --> 52:03.860
of whether the objects of consciousness

52:03.860 --> 52:06.340
have any being outside of consciousness,

52:06.340 --> 52:09.140
and you study the pure structure of consciousness.

52:10.540 --> 52:14.020
Now, Hegel just thinks, okay, that's cool,

52:14.020 --> 52:18.780
but we've already, we've seen that movie before.

52:18.780 --> 52:20.580
It was called early modern histology.

52:22.900 --> 52:26.380
My general view on, so one of the things

52:26.380 --> 52:28.220
that's frustrating about the Hegel reception

52:28.820 --> 52:30.100
is a lot of people think, oh, you know,

52:30.100 --> 52:32.020
Hegel's a dead dog, let's reject Hegel,

52:32.020 --> 52:36.180
but the objections to Hegel are largely terrible.

52:36.180 --> 52:37.740
And then what's really frustrating

52:37.740 --> 52:39.380
is people think they're gonna do this other thing.

52:39.380 --> 52:42.460
And it's like, okay, that view is already a sub-model

52:42.460 --> 52:43.940
of the phenomenology of spirit.

52:43.940 --> 52:46.660
Like, Hegel is fully aware of that as a possibility.

52:46.660 --> 52:48.580
He foresaw it and he refuted it.

52:48.580 --> 52:49.940
So what are we doing here, guys?

52:49.940 --> 52:51.180
What are we doing here?

52:52.620 --> 52:54.580
Yeah, someone else, yes.

52:55.300 --> 52:57.100
I was gonna say, how would Hegel explain

52:57.100 --> 52:59.420
the kind of experience that, like,

53:01.020 --> 53:03.500
you just go, like, more and more wrong,

53:03.500 --> 53:06.620
for example, like, if I choose the wrong path

53:06.620 --> 53:09.780
of argument in an essay, well, I believe that's true.

53:09.780 --> 53:11.740
And I just go, like, more and more wrong,

53:11.740 --> 53:13.180
like, just the wrong, and.

53:14.900 --> 53:18.380
It's logically independent or orthogonal

53:18.380 --> 53:20.300
to what Hegel is doing in the phenomenology of spirit.

53:20.300 --> 53:22.580
The phenomenology of spirit is not psychology.

53:22.580 --> 53:24.940
This is not a claim of a human psychology

53:24.940 --> 53:28.180
or what human psychology does in respect,

53:28.180 --> 53:30.220
in the face of error.

53:30.220 --> 53:34.620
It's a logical claim about the nature of consciousness.

53:34.620 --> 53:37.420
So you might not care that you're wrong,

53:37.420 --> 53:39.540
but consciousness has such ducts.

53:39.540 --> 53:43.040
And that's why, in general, consciousness,

53:44.420 --> 53:46.060
when it discovers an incoherence

53:46.060 --> 53:49.180
in its own self-conception alters it.

53:49.180 --> 53:50.620
And one way of seeing that,

53:50.660 --> 53:52.980
although this is not the theme of the phenomenology,

53:52.980 --> 53:56.220
is this story is played out in history,

53:56.220 --> 53:58.540
but it's not the topic of the phenomenology.

53:58.540 --> 54:00.540
The key thing is that in absolute knowing

54:00.540 --> 54:01.500
at the end of the book,

54:01.500 --> 54:06.000
Hegel says spirit releases itself into history,

54:06.000 --> 54:09.080
which means that all of this does happen in history,

54:09.080 --> 54:10.900
but it doesn't happen in this order.

54:10.900 --> 54:12.860
And that is not the topic of this book.

54:12.860 --> 54:14.180
So these shapes of consciousness

54:14.180 --> 54:15.900
are historically real.

54:15.900 --> 54:19.840
And historically, when human societies recognize

54:19.880 --> 54:21.720
that their conception of their relationship

54:21.720 --> 54:23.320
to the world is incoherent,

54:24.600 --> 54:26.560
they change, not immediately.

54:26.560 --> 54:29.360
Sometimes they persist in the contradiction.

54:29.360 --> 54:33.960
And then the undoing of that contradiction

54:33.960 --> 54:37.020
can involve massive historical change.

54:37.020 --> 54:39.180
For instance, my country is founded on the idea

54:39.180 --> 54:41.120
that all men are created equal.

54:41.120 --> 54:43.680
It was also founded on economic side

54:43.680 --> 54:45.400
and the exploitation of enslaved people.

54:45.400 --> 54:46.560
That's a contradiction.

54:47.400 --> 54:49.720
You can either think of that contradiction

54:49.720 --> 54:51.240
as having worked out in the Civil War

54:51.240 --> 54:53.480
as we're still not being worked out.

54:53.480 --> 54:56.040
But that's a perfect example of a Hegelian contradiction

54:56.040 --> 54:57.480
worked out historically.

54:57.480 --> 54:58.360
Yeah.

54:58.360 --> 55:00.200
Does consciousness know a symbol

55:00.200 --> 55:02.600
of becoming spirit in its beginning?

55:02.600 --> 55:03.440
No.

55:03.440 --> 55:06.640
Or like, so it only goes to my guess.

55:07.880 --> 55:10.640
It gets some anticipation later on.

55:10.640 --> 55:13.200
Later on, it's like you can see in the distance this thing

55:13.200 --> 55:15.280
and it's like, that would be really awesome.

55:15.320 --> 55:17.480
Early on, consciousness, as we'll see next week

55:17.480 --> 55:19.240
when we talk about the first shape of consciousness,

55:19.240 --> 55:22.040
the first shape of consciousness knows one thing.

55:22.040 --> 55:22.880
This.

55:25.120 --> 55:27.880
What's the grounds of the movement itself?

55:27.880 --> 55:31.440
The grounds of the movement itself is the

55:34.720 --> 55:37.680
the self-reputation of consciousness.

55:37.680 --> 55:38.520
Yeah.

55:38.520 --> 55:41.120
What limits consciousness from knowing the being?

55:42.120 --> 55:44.520
Nothing.

55:44.520 --> 55:47.560
What limits consciousness from knowing the in itself

55:47.560 --> 55:51.640
is all of its conceptions of the in itself and knowing

55:51.640 --> 55:54.480
short of absolute no.

55:54.480 --> 55:59.320
So one way of thinking about the relationship

55:59.320 --> 56:02.160
between Hegel and Kant is Kant thinks

56:02.160 --> 56:04.600
that at least theoretically things themselves

56:04.600 --> 56:06.720
are unavailable to us.

56:06.720 --> 56:09.660
Hegel thinks nothing is unavailable to us.

56:10.060 --> 56:12.060
There might be facts that are unknowable to us,

56:12.060 --> 56:14.300
there might be details of my particular objects,

56:14.300 --> 56:16.260
but there's nothing that is structurally

56:16.260 --> 56:18.740
or logically unknowable to us.

56:18.740 --> 56:21.060
Everything is in principle available

56:21.060 --> 56:22.300
or transparent to spirit.

56:24.940 --> 56:27.700
Consciousness and science of consciousness

56:27.700 --> 56:29.580
both are events?

56:29.580 --> 56:32.180
No, because events happen in time.

56:32.180 --> 56:35.100
None of these, the phenomenology of spirit

56:35.100 --> 56:37.860
is not about any events, it's not about any times.

56:37.860 --> 56:40.660
Hegel illustrates various shapes of consciousness

56:40.660 --> 56:42.580
with historical references.

56:42.580 --> 56:45.180
But people who focus on those things

56:45.180 --> 56:48.060
and take the phenomenology to be about them

56:48.060 --> 56:50.060
in the words of my friend Marcus Gabriel

56:50.060 --> 56:53.180
are expositing Hegel's examples, not Hegel.

56:53.180 --> 56:55.300
They are scholars of Hegel's metaphors,

56:55.300 --> 56:56.900
not of the phenomenology of spirit.

56:56.900 --> 56:57.740
Yeah, in the back.

56:57.740 --> 57:01.300
Yes, last section, paragraph 26.

57:01.300 --> 57:05.620
There's two instances I, well, we were talking about that

57:05.620 --> 57:07.820
in the book, but I'm not going to emphasize

57:07.820 --> 57:10.100
how different from a point of decision between science

57:10.100 --> 57:12.380
or the knowledge, apparent knowledge,

57:12.380 --> 57:14.300
what true knowledge that we declare,

57:14.300 --> 57:18.020
because it's like both and I guess not.

57:18.020 --> 57:20.060
But like in time, science declares-

57:20.060 --> 57:21.700
Just could you just tell me where in some instances?

57:21.700 --> 57:23.740
Yeah, science declares its beam to me its power,

57:23.740 --> 57:25.900
but I'm sure knowing this as much as fuel

57:25.900 --> 57:29.380
to the fact that it is, and it gives out the assurance

57:29.380 --> 57:31.740
that science counts as nothing,

57:31.740 --> 57:34.500
so what does it mean, the science declares its beam

57:35.100 --> 57:36.420
on the standard and-

57:36.420 --> 57:40.340
Oh, so the idea is science says I am science.

57:40.340 --> 57:42.460
So I know stuff.

57:42.460 --> 57:44.420
But the person who doesn't have science,

57:44.420 --> 57:46.100
but thinks they have science, can say the same thing.

57:46.100 --> 57:47.500
They can give the same little speech,

57:47.500 --> 57:48.660
because they both are.

57:50.700 --> 57:51.540
Yes.

57:52.540 --> 57:54.180
This is for the study of study of the last question,

57:54.180 --> 57:56.940
but does Hegel ever provide an explicit justification

57:56.940 --> 57:59.700
of how we can be certain that the conditions

57:59.700 --> 58:02.860
for this whole progression are all identical to success?

58:02.860 --> 58:06.020
How does he know that nature sort of never intervenes

58:06.020 --> 58:07.340
in the progression of consciousness,

58:07.340 --> 58:09.340
and that can all just sort of contain

58:09.340 --> 58:10.620
within consciousness itself?

58:10.620 --> 58:14.260
Okay, so that would be a problem if this were a description

58:14.260 --> 58:17.300
of a concrete process happening in reality.

58:17.300 --> 58:21.260
This is a purely logical or conceptual account.

58:21.260 --> 58:23.980
So the word about nature intervening

58:23.980 --> 58:27.980
or nature not cooperating is no more a problem

58:27.980 --> 58:30.380
than this for a logic textbook.

58:30.380 --> 58:32.620
If you said, how do you know that if P

58:33.260 --> 58:36.580
then Q, then Q, nature might intervene.

58:36.580 --> 58:39.020
Nature might, just at the moment you're concluding

58:39.020 --> 58:42.540
that Q of earth, queen, or meteor might happen.

58:42.540 --> 58:43.500
That's not a problem here.

58:43.500 --> 58:46.820
That might be a problem for Hegel's theory of history.

58:46.820 --> 58:48.060
When you get to Hegel's history,

58:48.060 --> 58:50.220
Hegel's theory of history might have the problem

58:50.220 --> 58:53.780
that well a meteor could come and not wipe out humanity.

58:53.780 --> 58:55.460
I don't think it does have that problem,

58:55.460 --> 58:58.580
but it is standardly read as having that problem.

58:58.580 --> 58:59.420
Yeah.

58:59.420 --> 59:02.900
Just from that hour or on science stuff,

59:02.900 --> 59:05.220
a word is mentioned in the time that I don't understand,

59:05.220 --> 59:06.540
it's the word imitation.

59:06.540 --> 59:07.380
What's that?

59:07.380 --> 59:09.340
Is that something like a reference to your way

59:09.340 --> 59:11.460
of understanding the world?

59:11.460 --> 59:14.340
Imitation is just something that pretends

59:14.340 --> 59:16.180
to be something that it isn't.

59:16.180 --> 59:20.340
So, you know, there's imitation cheese,

59:20.340 --> 59:22.260
which is not cheese.

59:22.260 --> 59:24.220
It's like made out of non-dairy products.

59:24.220 --> 59:27.100
There's imitation crab, which is not crab.

59:27.100 --> 59:28.900
It's all of the most repulsive,

59:28.900 --> 59:32.820
inedible parts of some fish that's been reformed

59:32.820 --> 59:35.180
to make it look like crab and die.

59:35.180 --> 59:36.100
What is intimation?

59:36.100 --> 59:37.500
Oh, intimation, sorry.

59:37.500 --> 59:38.380
Oh, intimation.

59:39.780 --> 59:44.360
Yeah, so an intimation is like when you kind of vaguely

59:44.360 --> 59:46.620
sense that something is gonna happen,

59:46.620 --> 59:51.300
but you can't really say exactly what.

59:51.300 --> 59:53.620
So many of you have an intimation

59:53.620 --> 59:54.940
that this class is gonna become

59:54.940 --> 59:56.700
completely incomprehensible.

59:57.060 --> 01:00:00.220
That's more than an intimation,

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:03.580
because I've more or less told you that that's gonna happen.

01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:04.420
Yeah?

01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:05.260
I'll ask you a question.

01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:08.540
What is the word natural at to natural?

01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:10.140
Good question.

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.220
I think what it means,

01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:17.220
I think it's supposed to justify

01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:20.860
why we start with the shape of consciousness

01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:21.860
that we've given.

01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:24.240
Namely, it's the most immediate

01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:27.040
or least sophisticated possible shape of consciousness.

01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:30.320
On the other hand, I mean, sorry,

01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:32.760
I didn't ignore that, that's wrong.

01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:35.080
What it means by calling that natural consciousness

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.940
is that that is the position

01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:39.720
of philosophically untrue to common sense.

01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.580
That's the natural starting point to think about knowledge.

01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.840
I have a being, there's some other beings,

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.120
they're distinct from me.

01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:49.280
I've gotta know about them.

01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:50.200
How do I do that?

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.000
That leads you into the whole problem.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:53.840
Yeah?

01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.840
So, sorry, I'm trying to find a way to frame the phone.

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:04.600
So is there a sort of an original point of,

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:07.240
so the being for, the being in itself,

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:10.600
it seems to me it's for Hegel.

01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.400
It's already at any rate sort of being schematized

01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:15.400
already by the consciousness

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.760
so that it can make its presence into,

01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.680
you know, a relationship in knowing.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.800
So, which it's sort of,

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.000
a schematization is already a sort of,

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:33.000
a sort of derivation from the original being in itself.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.320
So what you're right about is being in itself here

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:42.560
is the in itself of the object of knowledge,

01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:43.840
or the object of consciousness,

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.320
which means that the in itself,

01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:47.440
insofar as we cannot be conscious of it,

01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:48.920
is not on the table.

01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:52.800
But remember, the topic here is, what can we know?

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:55.440
So the in itself, insofar as we can't be conscious of it,

01:01:55.440 --> 01:01:58.040
is definitely not a topic for epistemology.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:01.320
Secondly, knowledge here, I just, I keep trying to,

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:03.480
knowledge is extremely general.

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:06.000
It's what, it is the relationship of consciousness

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:06.840
to a topic.

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.840
So if we can't be conscious of it,

01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:13.120
this in itself that isn't even,

01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.840
isn't the in itself of the object of consciousness.

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:16.680
If the in itself,

01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:18.440
that can't even be an object of consciousness,

01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.160
how do we even talk about it?

01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.800
So it's just not relevant.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:25.000
So the starting point, the original point of,

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
of dialect is when you take a little movement,

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.640
it's already in a mode of knowing, sort of.

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:32.560
Exactly, it's all of this is within a thought.

01:02:32.560 --> 01:02:33.920
We're not talking,

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.560
the phenomena does not start with beings.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:41.040
It starts with the relationship of consciousness to beings.

01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:43.400
In particular, it starts with the relationship

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.040
of consciousness to beings as conceived by consciousness.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:48.400
Everything is within a thought.

01:02:48.720 --> 01:02:49.800
I'll see you next week.

01:02:49.800 --> 01:02:51.960
And if you have any questions for today,

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:53.800
please hand them in and they'll just pick.

01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.800
And if you're auditing, please do not hand in.

01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:19.240
Okay.

01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.160
You need to stop worrying about the nine digits.

01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:53.400
Good luck with finishing your application.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.400
Actually, yeah, unless I have a copy.

01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:24.400
So are you a Hegelian now?

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.200
No, I'm just, I don't know what you're saying.

01:04:26.200 --> 01:04:27.680
Is there a Kantian?

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:28.520
Sorry?

01:04:28.520 --> 01:04:29.360
I don't even know what he's saying.

01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:30.200
Hi.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.000
If you had to describe your position,

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.160
last I checked, you were like very into it.

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:39.440
I still am.

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.360
I think about him every day.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.680
Okay.

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:45.920
Oh, I mean, theoretically, yeah, like.

01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:47.440
So does that cost?

01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:50.360
Ancient philosophy.

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.000
I can also find a classic department.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.440
So I assume you also have a wonderful,

01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.720
is there a reason that I was like-

01:04:56.720 --> 01:05:01.720
No, he only taught me one class and I wasn't too confident.

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.320
But I got a letter from-

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.760
I don't understand.

01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.600
You have to not imagine that it's like

01:05:07.600 --> 01:05:09.040
more difficult than it is.

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.160
I think my third year-

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.560
He's just making some point.

01:05:11.560 --> 01:05:13.040
Am I laughing at it?

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:13.880
That's impossible.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:16.040
I feel like I understand that.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:17.600
He's telling you what you already know.

01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:19.560
Like, you take all the good stuff.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.360
He's like, you gotta be a flop person.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:22.200
You gotta know stuff.

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:23.040
There's not a lot of flop.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:23.880
There's not a lot of flop.

01:05:23.880 --> 01:05:24.720
I don't, I don't-

01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.560
Yeah.

01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:26.400
Yeah.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:27.840
There's no sense to-

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:28.680
No, he's not.

01:05:28.680 --> 01:05:29.880
His ontology's too difficult.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:31.360
He's the easiest person to read.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:34.720
Literally, you just gotta read sentences after something.

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:37.320
Yeah, but his ontology's so difficult.

01:05:37.320 --> 01:05:38.160
He's not.

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:39.000
He's literally just telling someone,

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:39.840
there's just one thing.

01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:40.680
There's just one thing.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.520
What do you think about Spinoza?

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.560
Spino- I love Spinoza.

01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.520
We love Spinoza.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.480
Everyone should love Spinoza.

01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:46.760
Yeah.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:47.600
No.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:49.640
I don't understand.
