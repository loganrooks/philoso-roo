00:00.500 --> 00:05.000
So the project of the phenomenology of spirit

00:05.000 --> 00:09.560
is to determine what knowledge is or what knowing is.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.800
And the reason that we want to do that

00:11.800 --> 00:15.720
is to determine whether knowledge of the absolute

00:15.720 --> 00:20.840
is possible or whether, as Kant argued in the first critique,

00:20.840 --> 00:24.680
the absolute lies beyond the limits, at least,

00:24.680 --> 00:27.200
of theoretical knowledge we're going to be in.

00:27.200 --> 00:29.760
Now, what the absolute is for Hegel

00:29.840 --> 00:33.280
is something that it's going to take us a while to see.

00:33.280 --> 00:36.640
And there's kind of no, I don't think

00:36.640 --> 00:40.080
it's probably helpful to say the Hegelian formula of what

00:40.080 --> 00:42.840
the absolute idea is before we get there.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.720
So the short version is it's what

00:44.720 --> 00:48.680
Hegel will call the absolute idea at the end of the logic.

00:48.680 --> 00:51.800
Before we get there, you can think of it as God.

00:51.800 --> 00:56.120
A little bit better, you can think of it as Spinoza's God.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.720
A little bit better, you can think of it

00:57.840 --> 01:01.920
as the unconditioned in Kant.

01:01.920 --> 01:03.560
And even better than that would be

01:03.560 --> 01:08.080
if you thought of it as neither subjective, so neither

01:08.080 --> 01:12.120
a mind nor nature, but something that's both.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.200
What the hell that means, you'll see.

01:15.200 --> 01:20.280
So Hegel then discusses what I call

01:20.280 --> 01:23.960
the meta-epistemological problem, a problem about how

01:23.960 --> 01:26.640
we determine what the correct epistemology is,

01:26.640 --> 01:29.800
what the correct account of what knowing is.

01:29.800 --> 01:33.480
And the problem is, how do we decide,

01:33.480 --> 01:35.840
not just between different knowledge claims,

01:35.840 --> 01:38.240
but between different epistemologies?

01:38.240 --> 01:40.920
So if I claim to know that Fargo is

01:40.920 --> 01:44.520
the capital of North Dakota, and you claim that I don't know

01:44.520 --> 01:47.640
that because it's false, but we share the same epistemology,

01:47.640 --> 01:53.240
namely looking at an atlas, then that's not a big problem.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.040
But if you and I have different epistemologies,

01:56.040 --> 01:58.560
and I claim I know that God exists

01:58.560 --> 02:00.840
on the basis of immediate religious state,

02:00.840 --> 02:03.920
then you say, well, you couldn't know whether God exists,

02:03.920 --> 02:06.520
because the proposition God exists appears nowhere

02:06.520 --> 02:07.760
in natural science.

02:07.760 --> 02:10.440
Well, first of all, we both have really shitty epistemologies.

02:10.440 --> 02:13.480
But secondly, and arguably the second one

02:13.480 --> 02:18.200
is worse than the first, there's no way

02:18.200 --> 02:22.360
to adjudicate which of us has the correct conception

02:22.360 --> 02:24.640
of knowledge on the basis of which we could then

02:24.640 --> 02:28.040
adjudicate who knows what they claim to be.

02:28.040 --> 02:39.400
So Hegel relates this to the problem of the criterion,

02:39.400 --> 02:42.760
which was originally formulated by sextus empiricus

02:42.760 --> 02:45.400
in the outlines of purinism.

02:45.400 --> 02:49.600
And the problem of the criterion takes the form of a dilemma.

02:49.600 --> 02:54.080
Either we have some can someone makes a knowledge claim,

02:54.080 --> 02:56.080
and they have a certain conception of knowledge.

02:56.080 --> 02:57.840
They claim to know that God exists

02:57.840 --> 03:01.360
on the basis of immediate religious faith.

03:01.360 --> 03:06.040
We either apply their own conception of knowledge,

03:06.040 --> 03:09.280
in which case trivially, their knowledge claim

03:09.280 --> 03:11.840
is going to be vindicated.

03:11.840 --> 03:14.620
So if we either, for each person's

03:14.620 --> 03:18.360
conception of knowledge, we simply apply it to itself,

03:18.360 --> 03:21.000
everyone's going to pass that task.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.240
The other possibility is that we apply

03:23.240 --> 03:25.160
a different conception of knowledge.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.480
The problem with that is that looks question made.

03:27.480 --> 03:30.880
Someone says, I know that God exists

03:30.880 --> 03:33.000
on the basis of immediate religious faith.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.840
And then I say, well, that epistemology

03:35.840 --> 03:37.960
doesn't justify that knowledge claim,

03:37.960 --> 03:40.680
because that epistemology fails the criterion

03:40.680 --> 03:42.040
of my epistemology.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.920
Namely, you know those and only those things

03:44.920 --> 03:48.520
that appear as propositions in empirical natural science.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.580
I've banked the question against the person

03:50.580 --> 03:52.920
who has a different criterion of knowledge

03:52.920 --> 03:55.600
or a different conception of what knowledge is.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.760
So Hegel's solution is a version of the first one,

03:59.760 --> 04:05.360
where we apply some conception of knowledge to itself.

04:05.360 --> 04:08.160
But the difference is he thinks that these conceptions

04:08.160 --> 04:11.360
of knowledge, or concepts, as he calls them

04:11.360 --> 04:16.680
in the phenomenology, typically do not agree with themselves.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.960
When you look at them, what you see

04:18.960 --> 04:21.880
is their conception of knowledge and their conception

04:21.900 --> 04:25.980
of the object of knowledge don't agree.

04:25.980 --> 04:29.380
And now you might think that's very artificial.

04:29.380 --> 04:32.020
But actually, if you look at a lot of epistemology,

04:32.020 --> 04:34.380
certainly in the history of philosophy,

04:34.380 --> 04:38.500
you'll find it is very often these problems do arise.

04:38.500 --> 04:41.500
If you read Locke, it's very unclear how Locke

04:41.500 --> 04:44.540
thinks he knows all of the things he thinks he knows,

04:44.540 --> 04:46.380
because he thinks he knows everything

04:46.380 --> 04:49.660
he knows through sensation, ultimately.

04:49.680 --> 04:53.200
But that he claims to know that God exists,

04:53.200 --> 04:56.800
that there are substances with powers that are extended,

04:56.800 --> 04:58.400
or at least have primary qualities that

04:58.400 --> 05:00.600
resemble our ideas of them.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.640
And it's very unclear from Locke how he could know any

05:04.640 --> 05:06.280
of the things he claims to know.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.160
Likewise, the My Little Toy epistemology,

05:09.160 --> 05:12.480
the person who knows only the propositions enumerated

05:12.480 --> 05:14.400
in the empirical natural sciences, which

05:14.400 --> 05:15.880
here's one of the propositions.

05:15.880 --> 05:17.560
Here's a proposition that occurs nowhere

05:17.560 --> 05:19.200
in empirical natural science.

05:19.220 --> 05:21.780
You know all and only those things

05:21.780 --> 05:24.300
that are stated in the empirical natural science.

05:24.300 --> 05:26.460
But their own epistemology, they don't

05:26.460 --> 05:28.580
know what they claim to know.

05:28.580 --> 05:33.000
So Hegel's solution, which is to examine

05:33.000 --> 05:37.140
the internal coherence of these concepts of knowledge,

05:37.140 --> 05:42.220
is more productive than it might at first appear.

05:42.220 --> 05:44.900
So what Hegel is going to then engage in

05:44.900 --> 05:48.400
is an imminent or internal critique

05:48.400 --> 05:51.400
of various conceptions of knowledge,

05:51.400 --> 06:00.680
or as he calls them, forms or shapes of consciousness.

06:00.680 --> 06:01.760
Gestadens bÃ¼liskes.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.600
Now they're imminent because we are not

06:07.600 --> 06:10.720
going to impose our own criteria of knowledge

06:10.720 --> 06:12.440
on these shapes of consciousness.

06:12.440 --> 06:15.100
We're going to examine them purely internally

06:15.100 --> 06:17.840
and see whether their conception of knowledge

06:17.840 --> 06:20.720
matches their conception of the object of knowledge.

06:20.720 --> 06:22.460
That is to say, whether you could

06:22.460 --> 06:25.060
know, according to their conception of what knowledge

06:25.060 --> 06:27.940
is, the object of knowledge according to their conception

06:27.940 --> 06:30.580
of the object of knowledge.

06:30.580 --> 06:36.740
Now Hegel adopts for expository or analytic purposes

06:36.740 --> 06:41.060
a kind of abstract model of what consciousness is.

06:41.060 --> 06:46.860
And that is we have consciousness,

06:46.860 --> 06:54.620
we have an object, which we call the in itself,

06:54.620 --> 06:59.540
because it isn't reducible to its being for consciousness,

06:59.540 --> 07:04.140
and we have the relationship of that object for consciousness,

07:04.140 --> 07:07.300
how it is for consciousness, which

07:07.300 --> 07:12.620
is another way of describing it.

07:12.620 --> 07:14.980
Now a few comments about this.

07:14.980 --> 07:18.060
One, you might say, but wait, aren't there

07:18.060 --> 07:21.900
conceptions of knowledge on which consciousness knows itself?

07:21.900 --> 07:23.140
Absolutely.

07:23.140 --> 07:25.700
But we're going to unfold those in the course

07:25.700 --> 07:26.940
of the phenomenon.

07:26.940 --> 07:29.820
So we start with what Hegel thinks

07:29.820 --> 07:35.100
of as the most immediate natural conception of knowledge, one

07:35.100 --> 07:37.380
in which you know something that is distinct from

07:37.380 --> 07:39.420
and irreducible to your knowledge of it.

07:39.420 --> 07:42.460
That's what Hegel characterizes as consciousness.

07:46.620 --> 07:53.900
Now the question is going to be, does this relation,

07:53.900 --> 07:58.340
as consciousness conceive of it, constitute knowledge

07:58.340 --> 08:01.380
of this object as consciousness conceives it?

08:01.380 --> 08:04.660
Another question is, where are these conceptions coming from?

08:04.660 --> 08:09.260
They're coming from consciousness itself.

08:09.260 --> 08:11.580
Or as Hegel will say, consciousness

08:11.580 --> 08:14.180
is the concept of itself.

08:14.180 --> 08:16.900
Consciousness has a conception of it.

08:16.900 --> 08:20.860
That means in the ordinary sense of self-consciousness,

08:20.860 --> 08:23.380
consciousness is self-conscious from the beginning

08:23.380 --> 08:25.420
of the phenomenon.

08:25.420 --> 08:28.620
In the ordinary sense of not only knowing objects,

08:28.620 --> 08:30.980
but also having some conception of what you're

08:30.980 --> 08:33.140
doing in knowing objects, who you are,

08:33.140 --> 08:35.020
what knowledge is, what the object is,

08:35.020 --> 08:38.740
self-consciousness is present from the very beginning.

08:38.740 --> 08:42.220
Self-consciousness in Hegel's conception,

08:42.220 --> 08:45.300
in the technical sense in which it emerges in the phenomenology,

08:45.300 --> 08:49.540
refers to review on which what knowledge fundamentally

08:49.540 --> 08:52.620
is, is self-consciousness, so that consciousness doesn't

08:52.620 --> 08:54.140
fundamentally know an object.

08:54.140 --> 08:56.940
It knows itself knowing an object.

08:56.940 --> 08:59.820
So that we're not going to get to in this case.

08:59.820 --> 09:01.460
You don't think that somehow consciousness

09:01.460 --> 09:03.180
has no conception of itself.

09:03.180 --> 09:06.900
Because if it did from the first page of the phenomenology,

09:06.900 --> 09:07.820
the project would fail.

09:13.700 --> 09:19.940
If this doesn't match this as consciousness conceives of it,

09:19.940 --> 09:22.940
then this is not a way of knowing this

09:22.940 --> 09:24.660
as consciousness conceives of it,

09:24.660 --> 09:29.420
and this shape of consciousness contradicts it.

09:29.460 --> 09:33.900
But now if this shape of consciousness contradicts itself,

09:33.900 --> 09:39.140
the result is not what Hegel calls an abstract negation.

09:39.140 --> 09:42.060
That is to say, we just give up on knowledge.

09:42.060 --> 09:47.580
The result is what Hegel calls a determinate negation.

09:47.580 --> 09:51.900
Or that is to say, a new shape of consciousness, which

09:51.900 --> 09:57.340
is determinately, specifically, not this shape of consciousness.

09:57.340 --> 09:59.700
And the new shape of consciousness,

09:59.700 --> 10:05.060
if this is object one, object two

10:05.060 --> 10:09.700
is the being of object one for consciousness.

10:13.980 --> 10:16.740
So the idea is we have some conception of knowing.

10:16.740 --> 10:18.780
We have some conception of the object of knowledge.

10:18.780 --> 10:22.020
That turns out not to be a way of knowing that object.

10:22.020 --> 10:24.700
So then what results from that is not, well,

10:24.700 --> 10:26.380
let's just give up on knowing.

10:26.380 --> 10:30.300
But oh, what we can know is objects

10:30.300 --> 10:33.500
insofar as they can be for consciousness in this way.

10:33.500 --> 10:39.060
And a very good example of this is,

10:39.060 --> 10:41.300
in the beginning of the Transcendent of Critique of Pure

10:41.300 --> 10:43.580
Reason, Kant's first view, this is

10:43.580 --> 10:45.740
a kind of slightly hokey, big alien reading

10:45.740 --> 10:47.940
of the beginning of the Critique of Pure Reason,

10:47.940 --> 10:50.900
you could think of the first shape of consciousness

10:50.900 --> 10:54.860
in the Critique of Pure Reason as transcendental realism.

10:55.500 --> 10:57.220
What we know is things in themselves,

10:57.220 --> 10:59.180
totally mind-dependent objects, and we

10:59.180 --> 11:01.420
know them in their mind-dependent nature.

11:01.420 --> 11:04.940
And we know them through their effects upon our sensibility.

11:04.940 --> 11:06.580
And then the argument of the first critique

11:06.580 --> 11:08.500
very early on in the Transcendental Aesthetic

11:08.500 --> 11:12.300
is that that way of knowing, sensible cognition,

11:12.300 --> 11:14.540
is not a way of knowing things in themselves.

11:14.540 --> 11:18.080
So then the second shape of consciousness,

11:18.080 --> 11:20.620
Kant's own view, Transcendental Idealism,

11:20.620 --> 11:22.500
is we know the being of consciousness

11:22.500 --> 11:24.500
of the first object for consciousness.

11:24.500 --> 11:27.580
What we know is not things in themselves

11:27.580 --> 11:29.700
via sensory cognition.

11:29.700 --> 11:32.060
We know the being of them for sensory cognition.

11:32.060 --> 11:35.100
That is to say, their appearance is sensory cognition.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.900
So the second object is the being of the first object

11:37.900 --> 11:38.900
for consciousness.

11:38.900 --> 11:41.740
In this case, the appearing of things in themselves

11:41.740 --> 11:43.420
to sensory cognition.

11:43.420 --> 11:45.300
That's just an illustration.

11:45.300 --> 11:50.540
So now we have a conception of how the phenomenology moves.

11:50.540 --> 11:53.900
That is to say, how we go from one shape of consciousness

11:53.900 --> 11:55.780
to the next.

11:55.780 --> 11:57.940
A complete account would have to also include

11:57.940 --> 11:59.260
an account of where we start.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.780
But we're going to spend a lot of today talking about that.

12:01.780 --> 12:04.340
So I'm going to bracket that for now.

12:04.340 --> 12:07.740
Where does the phenomenology end?

12:07.740 --> 12:11.460
The phenomenology will end.

12:11.460 --> 12:12.580
Oh, we have some math.

12:19.180 --> 12:21.620
All right.

12:21.620 --> 12:29.860
The phenomenology will end when the relation of, let's say,

12:29.860 --> 12:32.620
consciousness, although it won't be called consciousness

12:32.620 --> 12:34.660
anymore, for reasons I'll go into,

12:34.660 --> 12:47.980
or the relation of consciousness to the in itself,

12:47.980 --> 12:52.780
where these things are so tightly identified

12:52.780 --> 12:56.780
that no possible gap between being for itself

12:56.780 --> 13:00.180
and being for consciousness could possibly arise.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.580
That is to say, where being in itself

13:02.580 --> 13:05.740
is being for consciousness, and being for consciousness

13:05.740 --> 13:08.380
is being for being in itself.

13:08.380 --> 13:11.220
Now, there's various names for that that Hegel has.

13:11.220 --> 13:17.180
One is, where truth becomes identical to certainty.

13:17.180 --> 13:21.340
One of the names for the in itself is truth.

13:21.340 --> 13:23.300
Another name for it is, another name

13:23.300 --> 13:26.220
for being for consciousness is certainty.

13:26.220 --> 13:29.300
So where truth and certainty are so closely identified

13:29.300 --> 13:31.820
that none of the skeptical problems

13:31.820 --> 13:33.820
that undermine forms of consciousness

13:33.820 --> 13:35.660
could possibly arise.

13:35.660 --> 13:38.580
The official name for this is absolute knowing.

13:38.580 --> 13:39.740
That's where the book ends.

13:42.660 --> 13:44.780
OK.

13:44.780 --> 13:48.180
So the book ends with section absolute knowing,

13:48.180 --> 13:50.420
or absolute knowledge, absolute citizen.

13:50.420 --> 13:52.620
I've put it on the reading next week,

13:52.620 --> 13:54.740
because although the idea of this class

13:54.740 --> 13:57.660
is let's read all the parts of Hegel you can read,

13:57.660 --> 14:01.740
I want you to also have a sense of what I'm sparing you.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.340
So try to read absolute knowing.

14:04.340 --> 14:07.300
You won't really succeed.

14:07.300 --> 14:11.140
It's kind of unreadable.

14:11.140 --> 14:15.300
Just a word further about reading in this class,

14:15.300 --> 14:21.700
if I were you, I would expect to read every text,

14:21.700 --> 14:25.820
every one of the readings in this class, three times.

14:25.820 --> 14:28.900
Read it once, and you'll be like, what is going on?

14:28.900 --> 14:30.380
I sort of a vague sense.

14:30.380 --> 14:33.620
Read it a second time, you'll understand much better.

14:33.620 --> 14:37.820
So the good news with Hegel is you do actually understand it

14:37.820 --> 14:39.500
the more you read it.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.620
Sometimes it won't feel that way.

14:41.620 --> 14:44.900
Now the phenomenology of getting really into Hegel,

14:44.900 --> 14:47.340
phenomenology in the ordinary sense of what it feels like,

14:47.340 --> 14:50.700
is you're constantly understanding it better.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.500
So you're tempted into the fallacy.

14:53.500 --> 14:56.020
Eventually, I'll understand it all.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.460
But constant improvement doesn't mean

14:59.460 --> 15:02.220
that you'll ever reach any finite value,

15:02.220 --> 15:05.900
because it might plateau.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.180
This is my worry.

15:07.180 --> 15:08.460
This is what keeps me up.

15:08.460 --> 15:09.700
This is time.

15:09.700 --> 15:13.100
This is staying to understanding.

15:13.100 --> 15:16.060
And then actual understanding would be here.

15:16.060 --> 15:16.940
But who knows?

15:16.940 --> 15:20.140
But I'm constantly increasing every time I'm going up,

15:20.140 --> 15:21.700
ever less.

15:21.700 --> 15:26.340
So let me just say a few more things.

15:26.340 --> 15:28.820
I forgot to say something about course mechanics.

15:28.820 --> 15:35.100
My office hours this week are.

15:38.460 --> 15:52.100
Wednesday 4.30 to 6, and Friday 3 to 4.

15:52.100 --> 15:55.420
My office hours will vary from week to week,

15:55.420 --> 15:58.180
because there's all these different job searches going

15:58.180 --> 15:59.620
on in the philosophy department.

15:59.620 --> 16:02.260
And I have to attend some of them.

16:02.260 --> 16:05.940
Some of you have asked me about secondary literature.

16:05.940 --> 16:08.860
My attitude towards secondary literature

16:08.860 --> 16:13.340
is the attitude towards those of you who have cool Gen X

16:13.340 --> 16:17.180
parents probably have towards your doing drugs, which

16:17.180 --> 16:19.940
is they tell you, do not do them.

16:19.940 --> 16:23.140
But if you were to do drugs, your parents

16:23.140 --> 16:26.220
would give you advice on how to do them safely.

16:26.220 --> 16:29.260
They would tell you, OK, don't do heroin.

16:29.260 --> 16:30.900
But if you could smoke a little weed,

16:30.900 --> 16:33.140
we're not going to throw you out of the house.

16:33.140 --> 16:35.580
So my advice is do not do drugs.

16:36.060 --> 16:37.420
Do not read secondary literature.

16:37.420 --> 16:39.980
But if you're going to, I would prefer

16:39.980 --> 16:42.860
you do it in a controlled, safe environment.

16:42.860 --> 16:45.940
And you do the marijuana equivalent of Hegel

16:45.940 --> 16:48.740
secondary literature rather than the fentanyl equivalent.

16:48.740 --> 16:51.060
I won't even tell you what the fentanyl equivalent of Hegel

16:51.060 --> 16:52.460
secondary literature is, because I don't

16:52.460 --> 16:53.860
want you to know about it.

16:53.860 --> 16:56.340
So if you come to me and you say,

16:56.340 --> 17:00.020
stay, I am going to read secondary literature.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.220
I'll try to talk you out of it.

17:01.220 --> 17:04.940
But if I fail to, I'll give you some advice on what to read.

17:05.540 --> 17:06.700
So another analogy.

17:06.700 --> 17:10.940
Reading the secondary literature,

17:10.940 --> 17:13.900
it's the older version of using AI.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.420
So why is it bad to use AI?

17:16.420 --> 17:17.820
Do you learn nothing?

17:17.820 --> 17:20.860
Are all the answers on Claude or Chachupiti wrong?

17:20.860 --> 17:22.780
No, you can learn stuff from that.

17:22.780 --> 17:28.460
But if you use AI, you do not develop your own capacities

17:28.460 --> 17:29.580
till now.

17:29.580 --> 17:31.260
And that is what an education is about.

17:31.260 --> 17:33.820
An education is not about us telling you stuff

17:33.820 --> 17:35.140
that you didn't know.

17:35.140 --> 17:37.260
You could do that on your own.

17:37.260 --> 17:40.420
An education is about developing your own capacities.

17:40.420 --> 17:45.260
And when you use AI, you do not develop your own capacities.

17:45.260 --> 17:48.340
The aim of learning is not that it be known the P.

17:48.340 --> 17:52.460
It is for me to know the P. So when

17:52.460 --> 17:54.620
you read secondary literature, what you do not develop

17:54.620 --> 17:57.540
is your own capacity to read and engage

17:57.540 --> 18:00.500
in philosophical text.

18:00.500 --> 18:03.460
That was my little speech about why I hate AI

18:04.100 --> 18:07.620
and why I hate secondary literature.

18:07.620 --> 18:10.860
So another thing that I want to emphasize,

18:10.860 --> 18:15.340
the phenomenology of spirit is a conceptual development.

18:15.340 --> 18:17.900
So we talk about a process or a development

18:17.900 --> 18:20.100
in phenomenology of spirit, a sequence

18:20.100 --> 18:22.980
of shapes of consciousness.

18:22.980 --> 18:27.180
This is not a historical or temporal sequence.

18:27.180 --> 18:32.740
Although these shapes can be and are exhibited historically,

18:32.740 --> 18:35.540
they correspond, to varying degrees,

18:35.540 --> 18:38.620
to conceptions of knowing, conceptions

18:38.620 --> 18:41.500
of the relation of the subject to the object that

18:41.500 --> 18:46.660
have been present historically in different periods of history.

18:46.660 --> 18:49.660
Now there's a distinction in the phenomenology,

18:49.660 --> 18:51.740
which will come up numerous times

18:51.740 --> 18:56.740
in this class between what is for consciousness

18:56.740 --> 18:58.380
and what is for us.

18:58.380 --> 19:04.780
I'm looking for a special chalk that I've already lost.

19:08.780 --> 19:09.740
Under the whiteboard.

19:09.740 --> 19:10.820
Under the whiteboard.

19:10.820 --> 19:12.700
Is that not it?

19:12.700 --> 19:14.300
No, it is not.

19:14.300 --> 19:18.700
So I think I need the glasses to find the chalk.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.380
This will be sorted out later.

19:20.380 --> 19:22.860
So there's a distinction in the phenomenology

19:22.860 --> 19:25.900
between what is for consciousness.

19:28.380 --> 19:32.300
And what is for us.

19:35.020 --> 19:40.660
Sometimes, Hegel uses the term in itself.

19:40.660 --> 19:43.820
So that marks the distinction between what

19:43.820 --> 19:46.940
a given shape of consciousness is aware of.

19:46.940 --> 19:47.500
You're counted.

19:50.620 --> 19:53.300
What is imminent to a given shape of consciousness?

19:53.300 --> 19:54.900
What a given shape of consciousness

19:54.900 --> 19:57.220
is aware of of itself?

19:57.220 --> 19:59.420
What is for us is something that we

19:59.420 --> 20:01.420
understand about that shape of consciousness,

20:01.420 --> 20:04.100
but it doesn't understand about itself.

20:04.100 --> 20:06.620
So we, as the readers of the phenomenology,

20:06.620 --> 20:08.420
sometimes called the phenomenological observer,

20:08.420 --> 20:12.420
will note certain things about shapes of consciousness.

20:12.420 --> 20:14.780
That's not going to work.

20:14.780 --> 20:16.620
That's kind of stupid.

20:16.620 --> 20:17.740
Hegel never said that.

20:17.740 --> 20:21.140
Or this sort of is like a previous shape of consciousness.

20:21.140 --> 20:23.060
Or you can tell that this is going to be a problem.

20:23.060 --> 20:26.900
Or consciousness will face this problem.

20:26.900 --> 20:30.220
Those are not imminent remarks for consciousness.

20:33.780 --> 20:35.540
So one other remark.

20:35.540 --> 20:37.540
I talked about this a little bit last time,

20:37.540 --> 20:39.620
and I felt like what I did so really unclearly.

20:42.780 --> 20:46.260
Hegel uses, I'll just encompass the questions in a second.

20:46.260 --> 20:48.300
Hegel is very typical of Hegel.

20:48.300 --> 20:51.460
So there's this book called the Hegel dictionary.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.260
If you were to read secondary literature,

20:53.260 --> 20:55.260
which you should not do, you might be aware of it.

20:55.260 --> 20:58.740
And the joke about the Hegel dictionary is every entry,

20:58.740 --> 21:01.100
ultimately, if you read all the entries,

21:01.100 --> 21:03.900
they ultimately just go back to idea or spirit.

21:03.900 --> 21:05.980
Because everything is just another synonym

21:05.980 --> 21:07.380
for idea or spirit.

21:07.380 --> 21:12.140
So in Hegel, there's this problem of massive,

21:12.140 --> 21:13.780
this multiplication of terms that all

21:13.780 --> 21:16.380
refer to the same thing, but they mean different things.

21:16.380 --> 21:19.380
Or there are different modes of presentation of one

21:19.380 --> 21:20.940
underlying reality.

21:21.020 --> 21:35.940
So consciousness, self-consciousness, reason,

21:35.940 --> 21:40.060
and spirit in the phenomenology really all

21:40.060 --> 21:43.060
refer to the same thing.

21:43.060 --> 21:46.060
But they refer to that underlay.

21:46.060 --> 21:47.420
They refer to spirit.

21:47.420 --> 21:50.900
They refer to different grades or degrees

21:50.900 --> 21:54.660
of that thing's conception of itself.

21:54.660 --> 21:59.820
So that means they are all spirit in itself,

21:59.820 --> 22:04.420
but they are not yet spirit for itself.

22:04.420 --> 22:08.180
Spirit is in and for itself fully and totally

22:08.180 --> 22:09.420
only at the end of the book.

22:09.420 --> 22:11.820
Only at the end of the book are we

22:11.820 --> 22:13.620
talking about a shape of consciousness

22:13.620 --> 22:18.220
that is fully and completely aware of what it is.

22:18.220 --> 22:20.900
But all along, they're in itself spirit.

22:20.900 --> 22:25.860
So in itself sometimes means something like implicitly.

22:25.860 --> 22:30.380
Well, for itself means explicitly.

22:30.380 --> 22:32.060
Sorry, the exact opposite.

22:36.780 --> 22:40.900
Now, that means when Hegel refers to something,

22:40.900 --> 22:42.980
some shape of consciousness as reason,

22:43.860 --> 22:49.380
he's referring to it at the highest level of actualization

22:49.380 --> 22:51.780
that it is aware of itself.

22:51.780 --> 22:57.980
So reason is spirit in itself that is not yet spirit.

22:57.980 --> 23:01.380
Sorry, spirit in itself that is not yet spirit for itself.

23:01.380 --> 23:04.020
It's only for itself reason.

23:04.020 --> 23:06.820
Now, it's also for itself consciousness

23:06.820 --> 23:08.100
and self-consciousness.

23:08.100 --> 23:11.140
But Hegel doesn't call it that because, or doesn't usually

23:11.140 --> 23:12.980
call it that because he wants to draw attention

23:12.980 --> 23:16.340
that he's talking about this thing at a level where

23:16.340 --> 23:17.700
it's aware of itself as reason.

23:21.180 --> 23:23.620
These give rise.

23:23.620 --> 23:26.260
And of course, between these is religion.

23:26.260 --> 23:29.940
But I'm skipping that because some of you

23:29.940 --> 23:31.440
at some point in this class are going

23:31.440 --> 23:34.300
to have this lingering suspicion that this is just

23:34.300 --> 23:37.380
all super poopy religious stuff.

23:37.380 --> 23:40.260
And I'm trying to delay as long as possible

23:40.980 --> 23:43.540
the anti-religious reaction to Hegel.

23:43.540 --> 23:45.300
So I'm just going to skip the religion thing.

23:45.300 --> 23:47.580
So when Hegel talks about reason,

23:47.580 --> 23:51.660
he's talking about, in some sense, the same entity.

23:51.660 --> 23:52.740
That's not the right word.

23:52.740 --> 23:54.860
The same thing, also not the right word.

23:54.860 --> 23:58.300
The same phenomenon as consciousness, self-consciousness,

23:58.300 --> 24:03.220
and spirit, but at a lower level of its conception

24:03.220 --> 24:06.140
of itself, of its understanding of itself as what it is.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.660
So the process of the phenomenology of spirit

24:08.740 --> 24:12.780
is consciousness coming to itself as spirit,

24:12.780 --> 24:16.760
or spirit in itself becoming spirit in and for itself,

24:16.760 --> 24:19.420
consciousness becoming fully and completely

24:19.420 --> 24:22.300
aware of itself as spirit.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.300
OK.

24:23.300 --> 24:25.580
Questions about this.

24:25.580 --> 24:26.060
Yes.

24:26.060 --> 24:28.660
I'm still stumbling a little bit over the fact

24:28.660 --> 24:32.100
that in the first distinction between what

24:32.100 --> 24:36.900
is for consciousness and what is for us or in itself,

24:36.900 --> 24:40.180
how in itself and for us can mean the same thing.

24:40.180 --> 24:41.860
For me, they mean the opposite.

24:41.860 --> 24:46.180
What is for me, I'm opposing what the object is for me.

24:46.180 --> 24:49.740
I'm opposing to be different from what it is in itself.

24:49.740 --> 24:51.020
Yes.

24:51.020 --> 24:52.740
So OK.

24:52.740 --> 24:57.980
So OK, good.

24:57.980 --> 25:06.620
So what Hegel means by calling what's for us in itself

25:06.660 --> 25:10.660
is that this is what consciousness is only

25:10.660 --> 25:12.260
implicitly.

25:12.260 --> 25:16.620
What it really is is something that isn't aware of.

25:16.620 --> 25:18.980
Yeah.

25:18.980 --> 25:27.460
So let me take a non-Hegelian example.

25:27.460 --> 25:39.340
You might say the Renaissance doesn't realize

25:39.340 --> 25:44.860
that what it is is the dissolution of Catholic era.

25:44.860 --> 25:46.340
This is a full example.

25:46.340 --> 25:49.340
But in itself, that's what it is.

25:49.340 --> 25:51.580
It is this thing that's a better example.

25:51.580 --> 25:55.740
Socrates, Hegel actually thinks, the appearance of Socrates

25:55.740 --> 25:58.260
within Athenian society is the destruction

25:58.260 --> 25:59.420
of Athenian society.

25:59.420 --> 26:02.100
Once you have Socrates, the form of life

26:02.100 --> 26:05.740
that is classical Athens can survive.

26:05.740 --> 26:09.340
So Socrates is in himself the end

26:09.340 --> 26:10.900
of the Athenian form of life.

26:10.900 --> 26:13.700
But he's not that for himself.

26:13.700 --> 26:16.860
That's why he's so surprised they want to put him to death.

26:16.860 --> 26:19.460
He's not like, I'm bringing it all to an end, guys.

26:19.460 --> 26:21.180
Because if he was, then they'd be like,

26:21.180 --> 26:23.420
well, we have to kill you.

26:23.420 --> 26:25.000
So there's a distinction between what

26:25.080 --> 26:27.320
something is in itself implicitly,

26:27.320 --> 26:29.400
but not yet if it's developed and realized for.

26:29.400 --> 26:35.240
And what we as the observers can see on who knows what grounds,

26:35.240 --> 26:38.000
it will eventually become and become

26:38.000 --> 26:40.440
aware of itself explicitly as.

26:40.440 --> 26:41.440
There was another one.

26:41.440 --> 26:42.840
Yes.

26:42.840 --> 26:47.080
Can we say consciousness and knowledge or experience?

26:47.080 --> 26:48.280
No.

26:48.280 --> 26:53.200
So experience, the technical meaning of experience in Hegel

26:53.200 --> 26:54.720
is the process.

26:54.720 --> 27:00.480
It's this.

27:00.480 --> 27:03.560
It's one shape of consciousness undermining itself

27:03.560 --> 27:04.840
and being replaced by an object.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.520
That's what experience is.

27:06.520 --> 27:08.960
So this, consciousness of an object,

27:08.960 --> 27:13.120
is not technically what Hegel means by experience.

27:13.120 --> 27:13.600
Yeah.

27:13.600 --> 27:17.680
So just back to movie star twist, is that right?

27:17.680 --> 27:22.800
So you said initially that knowing is often

27:22.800 --> 27:27.560
a conflict with consciousness, perceive of the object.

27:27.560 --> 27:29.440
Can you elaborate on that?

27:29.440 --> 27:32.400
Because that's two kinds of a relation.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.280
And if consciousness perceive of the object,

27:35.280 --> 27:37.080
wouldn't that also be knowing?

27:37.080 --> 27:37.600
Yeah, OK.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.960
So first of all, I just want to note, no,

27:39.960 --> 27:42.760
and this is relevant to the beginning of the book,

27:42.760 --> 27:47.160
self-certainty, your sense of certainty.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.160
So if this chalk is supposed to not get all over,

27:49.160 --> 27:50.720
it means the pot is not succeeding.

27:51.640 --> 27:53.200
It's because you wait for it.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.560
It's probably because I wait.

27:54.560 --> 27:55.600
It's probably my fault.

28:00.600 --> 28:03.840
So knowing here is an incredible,

28:03.840 --> 28:06.280
that's a very, very general term.

28:06.280 --> 28:10.360
So we're not assuming at the beginning of the phenomenology

28:10.360 --> 28:14.000
that knowing is anything like you would normally

28:14.000 --> 28:15.800
assume in philosophy.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.480
So it doesn't have a propositional object.

28:18.480 --> 28:21.240
It isn't true justified belief.

28:21.240 --> 28:23.560
It isn't opposed to illusion.

28:23.560 --> 28:26.520
It isn't opposed to mere opinion or belief.

28:26.520 --> 28:29.440
In sensuous certainty, just to anticipate,

28:29.440 --> 28:33.160
knowing is just, sensuous certainty can't really

28:33.160 --> 28:35.080
say this, but it's just sensuously

28:35.080 --> 28:36.480
apprehending something.

28:36.480 --> 28:39.200
This is knowing.

28:39.200 --> 28:40.440
That's knowing.

28:40.440 --> 28:44.440
Now that means that knowing in its most general sense

28:44.440 --> 28:47.960
is just the being of an object for consciousness.

28:48.040 --> 28:51.440
And so before we get, Hegel will develop

28:51.440 --> 28:55.600
over the course of phenomenology notions of knowledge

28:55.600 --> 28:57.040
that look more like what we normally

28:57.040 --> 28:59.000
talk about in epistemology.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.960
But at the very beginning, it's just

29:00.960 --> 29:05.120
whether this can be an object of consciousness.

29:05.120 --> 29:06.000
Yeah.

29:06.000 --> 29:09.400
So for consciousness, consciousness

29:09.400 --> 29:10.960
cannot see its own developments.

29:10.960 --> 29:12.720
It's only from the standpoint of for us

29:12.720 --> 29:14.120
that I can see the whole program.

29:14.120 --> 29:14.840
At the beginning.

29:14.840 --> 29:15.360
Yes.

29:15.360 --> 29:18.440
Eventually, consciousness will become self-conscious

29:18.440 --> 29:21.720
or aware of its development in the phenomenology.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.080
We won't get there.

29:23.080 --> 29:24.080
Yeah.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.960
I want to clarify imminence, because, for example,

29:26.960 --> 29:33.080
in your example, if Socrates himself is not aware of it

29:33.080 --> 29:35.960
or himself, he's not aware of the fact

29:35.960 --> 29:38.520
that he's a distraction of being in society,

29:38.520 --> 29:42.000
then the fact that Socrates is such a distraction

29:42.000 --> 29:45.560
would still be imminent, because it's not?

29:45.560 --> 29:49.840
If you said it in the courtroom in which Socrates

29:49.840 --> 29:52.320
is being tried, no.

29:52.320 --> 29:56.200
But it would be imminent if you could,

29:56.200 --> 29:59.160
as a Hegelian philosopher, figure out

29:59.160 --> 30:02.360
the underlying structure of Athenian society

30:02.360 --> 30:07.840
and then show that it cannot allow someone like Socrates

30:07.840 --> 30:09.960
within it and that once you even have

30:09.960 --> 30:11.800
the possibility of someone like Socrates,

30:11.920 --> 30:13.640
it's no longer stable.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.880
And that, therefore, historically destroys the Greek city

30:16.880 --> 30:23.400
state and give rise eventually to the Roman form of life,

30:23.400 --> 30:25.200
then you would have made explicit

30:25.200 --> 30:27.120
and you would have done so purely imminently

30:27.120 --> 30:30.560
within, so to speak, the logic of these different historically

30:30.560 --> 30:35.000
determined shapes of life that Socrates

30:35.000 --> 30:36.600
is the end of the Athenian society.

30:36.600 --> 30:38.200
But that was merely an illustration.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.960
I know, but in that case, it's not

30:41.200 --> 30:44.160
imminent for Socrates, but it's imminent for the Athenian

30:44.160 --> 30:45.360
society.

30:45.360 --> 30:48.200
It can be developed imminently, even

30:48.200 --> 30:51.800
if the people in that historical period are not aware of it.

30:51.800 --> 30:54.640
Or in other ways, we're getting way ahead of ourselves.

30:54.640 --> 30:59.840
History for Hegel is the process of contradictions

30:59.840 --> 31:02.360
in themselves being contradictions for themselves.

31:02.360 --> 31:04.320
That is to say, implicit contradictions becoming

31:04.320 --> 31:08.120
explicit contradictions, people being like, oh, wait.

31:08.120 --> 31:13.120
How can it be that all men are created equal in a doubt

31:13.120 --> 31:15.120
by the creator of certain inalienable rights

31:15.120 --> 31:19.280
if our entire society is founded on the labor of enslave?

31:19.280 --> 31:20.840
There was a question over here.

31:20.840 --> 31:21.440
Yes.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.840
It's just a simple question.

31:22.840 --> 31:25.520
So for that process, is Hegel actually

31:25.520 --> 31:28.960
being prescriptive or descriptive?

31:28.960 --> 31:30.880
Descriptive.

31:30.880 --> 31:31.360
Yes.

31:31.360 --> 31:32.880
Yeah, just a follow-up.

31:32.880 --> 31:37.280
So knowing just become the object of consciousness,

31:37.280 --> 31:41.440
how can it be at all with itself or contradict itself?

31:41.440 --> 31:42.440
We'll see.

31:42.440 --> 31:43.400
We'll see.

31:43.400 --> 31:43.880
Yes.

31:43.880 --> 31:45.200
Is there some even more meta thing

31:45.200 --> 31:46.880
that's supposed to happen to the observer

31:46.880 --> 31:49.560
as they move through the shapes of consciousness?

31:49.560 --> 31:50.360
Yes.

31:50.360 --> 31:52.520
I'm not going to emphasize that in this class,

31:52.520 --> 31:55.440
but I'll talk about this a little bit.

31:55.440 --> 31:59.720
But you, who I've never read the farm culture before,

31:59.720 --> 32:02.400
are supposed to have your consciousness raised

32:02.400 --> 32:05.960
to the level of spirit over the course of reading this book.

32:05.960 --> 32:09.240
So that is to say, you are all spirit in itself,

32:09.240 --> 32:11.840
but not yet spirit for itself, because you are not

32:11.840 --> 32:15.880
aware of what you are, namely spirit and what spirit is.

32:15.880 --> 32:18.120
So one of the roles the phenomenology of spirit

32:18.120 --> 32:20.520
is supposed to play is to get you off to that level.

32:20.520 --> 32:23.640
Now, the reason it's supposed to get you off to that level

32:23.640 --> 32:26.720
is so that you can then begin Hegelian science.

32:26.720 --> 32:30.240
So the phenomenology of spirit is essentially,

32:30.240 --> 32:33.040
in a certain way, it's the prerequisite

32:33.040 --> 32:36.200
for all of Hegel's classes at the University of Berlin.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.480
And in fact, at the beginning of the encyclopedia,

32:38.480 --> 32:41.880
he says something to the effect of like,

32:41.880 --> 32:44.720
what if you want to take this class without a prerequisite?

32:44.720 --> 32:46.840
And the answer is like, you can do that,

32:46.840 --> 32:49.800
but there are certain objections you're not allowed to raise.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.880
And this book answers all the objections

32:51.880 --> 32:54.720
you're not allowed to raise when you take logic

32:54.720 --> 32:57.800
at the University of Berlin in the 1820s with Professor

32:57.800 --> 32:59.000
Hegel.

32:59.000 --> 33:02.240
Now, I should have said this last time, but I didn't say it.

33:02.720 --> 33:04.560
So the way you should think about this class

33:04.560 --> 33:06.880
is the professor is Hegel.

33:06.880 --> 33:09.680
But in classic German professor style,

33:09.680 --> 33:11.840
he doesn't show up to his own lectures.

33:11.840 --> 33:15.360
He sends his assistant, me, to teach his lectures

33:15.360 --> 33:17.360
and to run his office out.

33:17.360 --> 33:19.080
So what we're trying to do is figure out

33:19.080 --> 33:22.560
what Professor Hegel thought, but he never shows up.

33:22.560 --> 33:26.120
So all we have is his books and the guy

33:26.120 --> 33:29.320
that he's forced to teach his classes for several years.

33:29.320 --> 33:32.600
And also in classic German professor style,

33:32.600 --> 33:35.640
we'll then completely ignore me and never help me professionally.

33:35.640 --> 33:38.080
OK, that's why.

33:38.080 --> 33:43.960
So let's start sense certainty.

33:43.960 --> 33:47.760
Before I begin, who found this reading hard?

33:47.760 --> 33:51.000
Who found this reading very hard?

33:51.000 --> 33:56.480
OK, just to give you an idea of the phenomenology,

33:56.480 --> 33:59.360
this is by far the easiest thing in the phenomenology.

33:59.360 --> 34:01.760
This is the thing that everyone kind of

34:01.760 --> 34:05.280
feels comfortable teaching in the phenomenology.

34:05.280 --> 34:12.560
So let us begin with the very opening of sense certainty.

34:12.560 --> 34:16.360
Now, in classic style, I have to sit down and read the text.

34:16.360 --> 34:29.320
It seems somehow sacrilegious to stand while reading.

34:29.320 --> 34:31.840
I don't feel the need to cover my head when reading Hegel,

34:31.840 --> 34:32.840
but OK.

34:40.320 --> 34:44.400
OK, so let me just dive in.

34:44.400 --> 34:49.400
Knowing which is initially our object or immediately

34:49.400 --> 34:54.120
can be nothing but immediate knowing of the immediate

34:54.120 --> 34:56.360
or of what is.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.760
Now, knowing is initially our object.

34:58.760 --> 35:02.680
So we have to begin by talking about knowing.

35:02.680 --> 35:05.560
We have to begin by talking about a shape of consciousness.

35:05.560 --> 35:08.480
Now, this is the beginning.

35:08.480 --> 35:13.280
That means we can't have arrived at this shape of consciousness

35:13.280 --> 35:14.760
by something else.

35:14.760 --> 35:18.680
So it can't have been mediated by a previous shape

35:18.680 --> 35:22.320
of consciousness or anything else in knowing.

35:22.320 --> 35:23.960
Now, mediation, this is a word you're

35:23.960 --> 35:27.600
going to hear a million, million, million times in this class.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.960
Just the simplest meaning of mediation,

35:29.960 --> 35:32.800
I think just like the most general way

35:32.800 --> 35:37.400
to think about it in Hegel, the place you should begin

35:37.400 --> 35:41.680
is just mediation just means by means of something else

35:41.760 --> 35:43.440
or by means of something else-ness.

36:00.240 --> 36:05.000
But now notice, by means of something else

36:05.000 --> 36:10.920
involves being one thing rather than another.

36:10.920 --> 36:20.960
So mediation goes together with determinism.

36:20.960 --> 36:22.760
So let me just give some examples.

36:22.760 --> 36:26.360
Mediate knowing is knowing something

36:26.360 --> 36:27.960
by knowing something else.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.960
The classic example is inference.

36:30.960 --> 36:33.880
If I know that Q, because I inferred it from P,

36:33.880 --> 36:38.520
and if P then Q, then my knowledge of Q is immediate.

36:38.520 --> 36:41.680
But that means if my knowledge is mediated,

36:41.680 --> 36:44.280
there are other items of knowledge it is not.

36:44.280 --> 36:49.800
It is determinantly Q rather than P or if P then Q.

36:49.800 --> 36:52.320
For there to be immediate or inferential knowledge,

36:52.320 --> 36:56.240
there has to be determinacy among the propositions.

36:56.240 --> 37:02.560
Now, determinacy is being one thing rather than another.

37:02.560 --> 37:10.800
Now, why does determinacy require mediation?

37:10.800 --> 37:16.600
Because if I'm this rather than that, if I'm x rather than y,

37:16.600 --> 37:22.160
I'm x partly by means of not being y.

37:22.160 --> 37:26.840
So mediacy and determinacy go together.

37:26.840 --> 37:31.120
Now, we have to start immediately.

37:31.120 --> 37:34.680
Because this is the beginning, the beginning has to be immediate.

37:34.680 --> 37:36.680
It can't be mediated by anything else.

37:43.520 --> 37:49.960
But that means it also has to be indeterminate.

37:49.960 --> 37:59.480
Now, what does it mean that we have to have an immediate knowing

37:59.480 --> 38:02.080
which is initially our object, or immediately,

38:02.080 --> 38:04.320
can be nothing but immediate knowing.

38:04.320 --> 38:07.720
So we have to have an immediate conception of knowing,

38:07.720 --> 38:11.400
not mediated by anything else.

38:11.400 --> 38:15.000
If it were knowledge of something mediated,

38:15.000 --> 38:18.440
then it wouldn't be an immediate conception of knowing.

38:18.440 --> 38:20.760
Because in order for it to be knowledge of that mediated thing

38:20.760 --> 38:23.760
or conceive of it, it would have to be knowledge of that thing

38:23.760 --> 38:25.320
as opposed to something else.

38:25.320 --> 38:27.640
And therefore, it would be mediated by that something else.

38:27.640 --> 38:31.480
So we have to immediately start with immediate knowledge,

38:31.480 --> 38:34.520
which is knowledge of the immediate.

38:34.520 --> 38:36.000
Now, what is knowledge of the immediate?

38:36.000 --> 38:39.960
It has to be knowledge of the indeterminate.

38:39.960 --> 38:43.040
That is to say, we don't know this rather than that.

38:43.040 --> 38:44.360
We just know this.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.640
We don't know one object as opposed to another.

38:46.640 --> 38:50.320
We just know the object.

38:50.320 --> 38:54.600
Now, there's a theme in the sensuous certainty

38:54.600 --> 38:56.320
that's going to be super important to this class

38:56.320 --> 39:03.040
that I'm going to delay a little bit for the end of class.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.560
And I'll just say it right now.

39:05.560 --> 39:09.400
So Hegel assumes that what knowledge is

39:09.400 --> 39:11.320
is knowledge of what is.

39:11.320 --> 39:13.000
You know what is.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.200
Just as you think about what is, you judge what is, et cetera.

39:17.200 --> 39:19.480
So you can see this from the very first sentence

39:19.480 --> 39:20.560
of the phenomenology.

39:20.560 --> 39:27.480
It is natural supposition that in philosophy,

39:27.480 --> 39:29.680
before one gets down to dealing with what is at issue,

39:29.680 --> 39:33.720
namely, the actual cognition of what in truth is.

39:33.720 --> 39:36.280
So basic assumption of phenomenology, what you know

39:36.280 --> 39:38.360
is what is or what has been.

39:38.360 --> 39:40.320
Now, you might ask, but don't I know things?

39:40.320 --> 39:43.240
I can know shadows.

39:43.240 --> 39:46.960
Not being is in a certain way a kind of being.

39:46.960 --> 39:50.320
It's relevant or determinate with respect to being.

39:50.960 --> 39:53.720
I want to set the being theme aside for now,

39:53.720 --> 39:55.160
because I'll come back to it later,

39:55.160 --> 39:58.760
and it's even more abstract than everything else.

39:58.760 --> 40:01.440
So we start with an immediate form of knowledge.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.840
That knowledge has to be immediate knowledge

40:03.840 --> 40:06.040
or knowledge of the immediate.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.080
Because otherwise, it would be mediated

40:08.080 --> 40:11.320
by something else, some conception of its knowledge

40:11.320 --> 40:12.960
as distinct from some other kind of knowledge,

40:12.960 --> 40:14.200
and then it wouldn't be the beginning,

40:14.200 --> 40:16.000
or knowledge of its object as distinct

40:16.000 --> 40:18.800
from some other object, and it wouldn't be immediate.

40:18.800 --> 40:21.560
So we know the first shape of consciousness

40:21.560 --> 40:24.200
is immediate knowledge of the immediate.

40:24.200 --> 40:30.320
It's just so it can't be knowing by mediation,

40:30.320 --> 40:33.080
and it can't be knowledge of what is immediate.

40:33.080 --> 40:33.800
Why?

40:33.800 --> 40:37.240
Because knowledge determines what the object of knowledge is.

40:37.240 --> 40:42.040
There has to be a fit between being for consciousness

40:42.040 --> 40:43.880
and the object of consciousness.

40:43.880 --> 40:47.800
So the being of consciousness, the being for consciousness

40:47.800 --> 40:51.920
is immediacy, and the object is immediate.

40:51.920 --> 40:54.040
We therefore are to alter nothing in the object

40:54.040 --> 40:55.480
as it presents itself, and we must

40:55.480 --> 40:57.280
keep our conceptualizing it apart

40:57.280 --> 40:58.720
from our apprehending of it.

40:58.720 --> 41:01.960
So that means both we as the phenomenological observer

41:01.960 --> 41:07.120
simply have to observe what this immediate shape of knowing is.

41:07.120 --> 41:09.600
It's not our job to alter it.

41:09.600 --> 41:12.480
We have to just observe what this shape of consciousness

41:12.480 --> 41:13.840
says about itself.

41:13.840 --> 41:16.560
But likewise, this shape of consciousness

41:16.560 --> 41:19.560
can't conceptualize its object.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.480
Why?

41:20.480 --> 41:25.200
Because conceptualizing something is determining it.

41:25.200 --> 41:28.080
It's representing it as falling under one concept rather than

41:28.080 --> 41:32.880
another, and that involves mediation.

41:32.880 --> 41:37.320
Conceptualizing is mediate, so the immediate

41:37.320 --> 41:39.360
has to be non-conceptual.

41:39.360 --> 41:40.960
Let me just read a little bit from here.

41:40.960 --> 41:43.920
The concrete content of sensuous certainty

41:43.920 --> 41:46.120
permits itself to appear immediately

41:46.120 --> 41:47.800
as the richest cognition.

41:47.800 --> 41:52.760
So this shape of consciousness thinks of itself.

41:52.760 --> 41:56.440
It's just immediate apprehension of the object.

41:56.440 --> 41:59.360
It's sensuous because we're in consciousness,

41:59.360 --> 42:02.760
and so we think the object is what determines what knowledge

42:02.760 --> 42:03.320
is.

42:03.320 --> 42:06.280
There's an object outside of consciousness

42:06.280 --> 42:09.000
that is the thing that we have to map or match onto.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.600
So it's sensuous, immediate circle.

42:11.680 --> 42:16.600
And it thinks of itself as the richest form of cognition

42:16.600 --> 42:23.960
because it lets the whole sensuous richness of the world

42:23.960 --> 42:28.840
be what it is without bringing it under consciousness.

42:28.840 --> 42:31.600
So Hegel is playing off this idea

42:31.600 --> 42:36.960
that people had in this period that conceptualizing things

42:36.960 --> 42:40.400
deprives them of their life or their richness.

42:41.320 --> 42:44.840
Concepts, of course, are only about generalities.

42:44.840 --> 42:47.200
I'll get to you in a second what things have in common.

42:47.200 --> 42:51.160
And so when you conceptualize, you ignore the infinitely rich

42:51.160 --> 42:53.120
particularity of every individual thing.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.440
So this form of consciousness thinks,

42:55.440 --> 42:57.360
I'm not doing any of that.

42:57.360 --> 43:00.080
I'm not desiccating anything or generalizing.

43:00.080 --> 43:04.440
I'm just purely apprehending everything immediately

43:04.440 --> 43:08.000
in its sensuous richness.

43:08.000 --> 43:09.840
Indeed, there's a knowing of an infinite wealth

43:10.280 --> 43:11.960
in which no limit is to be found,

43:11.960 --> 43:14.280
whether we venture out into the reaches of space and time

43:14.280 --> 43:15.960
as the place where that wealth extends itself

43:15.960 --> 43:17.680
or when we take a piece out of this pontitude

43:17.680 --> 43:19.680
divided and thereby delve into it.

43:19.680 --> 43:23.240
So there's no limits because a limit would,

43:24.160 --> 43:25.360
if there were a limit,

43:25.360 --> 43:26.800
there would be something beyond the limit

43:26.800 --> 43:28.840
that would involve mediation.

43:28.840 --> 43:31.520
So there's no limits extensively.

43:31.520 --> 43:34.160
There's no point beyond sensuous certainty.

43:34.160 --> 43:36.600
And there's no limits within the object.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.600
Sensuous certainty can dive further into the object,

43:38.600 --> 43:41.800
look further and further and further into the object.

43:41.800 --> 43:44.200
In addition, it appears as the most veritable

43:44.200 --> 43:46.880
where it has not omitted anything from its object

43:46.880 --> 43:49.160
because it isn't conceptually determining it.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.720
It's not leaving out some of its details

43:51.720 --> 43:54.040
and conceptualizing only some of them.

43:57.000 --> 44:00.720
But rather has its complete entirety before itself.

44:00.720 --> 44:04.160
However, this certainty in fact yields the most abstract

44:04.160 --> 44:06.280
and the very poorest truth.

44:06.280 --> 44:09.080
It expresses what it knows as this.

44:09.080 --> 44:10.400
It is.

44:10.400 --> 44:14.000
And its truth only contains the being of the object.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.800
Now this is, I wanna separate the being issue

44:16.800 --> 44:19.880
from the it issue for the following reason.

44:19.880 --> 44:22.760
It can't really properly speaking be the case

44:22.760 --> 44:26.960
that what sensuous certainty knows is it is or this is

44:26.960 --> 44:30.880
because that it is is not immediate

44:30.880 --> 44:33.800
because it involves a subject and a predicate.

44:33.800 --> 44:34.800
And so it would involve the difference

44:34.800 --> 44:36.320
between a subject and a predicate.

44:36.320 --> 44:38.040
It would involve immediate relationship

44:38.040 --> 44:39.760
between subject and predicate.

44:39.760 --> 44:43.000
It would be determining the it as being.

44:43.000 --> 44:45.520
So I wanna focus on it and then I'll come back to it.

44:47.200 --> 44:49.600
So now what Hegel is saying, he's gonna argue

44:49.600 --> 44:52.560
that contrary to what sensuous certainty thinks,

44:52.560 --> 44:56.560
it doesn't know, it isn't the richest

44:56.560 --> 45:00.640
and most variegated form of consciousness.

45:00.640 --> 45:03.680
In fact, what it does is the most universal and abstract.

45:04.840 --> 45:06.160
So just a little bit further.

45:06.160 --> 45:09.160
For sensuous certainty, this is what is essential

45:09.160 --> 45:11.720
and this pure being where this simple immediacy

45:11.720 --> 45:13.400
constitutes its truth.

45:13.400 --> 45:18.400
So the truth is this, or it.

45:18.560 --> 45:21.440
And being for consciousness certainty

45:21.440 --> 45:24.240
is just immediate apprehending.

45:24.240 --> 45:26.160
Likewise, as a relation certainty

45:26.160 --> 45:28.120
is an immediate pure relation.

45:28.120 --> 45:30.920
Consciousness is I, nothing further,

45:30.920 --> 45:32.840
a pure this and the singular individual

45:32.840 --> 45:35.800
knows a pure this or he knows the singular.

45:35.800 --> 45:39.680
So let's just take the first shape of consciousness

45:39.680 --> 45:44.400
to be I know this.

45:45.560 --> 45:50.080
Where knowledge here is just immediate.

45:52.560 --> 45:55.480
So I'm not conceptualizing this.

45:55.480 --> 45:57.880
And so this is not an object of concepts.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.720
It's not a thing with many properties.

46:00.720 --> 46:02.360
All right, yes.

46:05.320 --> 46:08.560
What is the root of immediate knowledge?

46:08.560 --> 46:10.680
So immediate knowledge is knowledge

46:10.680 --> 46:13.160
that isn't mediated by any other knowledge.

46:13.160 --> 46:16.600
So the idea is to note, this is what sensuous certainty

46:16.600 --> 46:19.840
thinks, to know this, I don't need to know anything else.

46:21.680 --> 46:25.840
However, if what I knew about this was that it was a pencil,

46:25.840 --> 46:29.760
I would need to know what a pencil is.

46:29.760 --> 46:32.560
I would need to know the difference between pencil

46:32.560 --> 46:35.560
and a pencil, that is to say the pencil

46:35.560 --> 46:38.280
and the universal pencil, et cetera, et cetera.

46:38.280 --> 46:40.120
But immediate knowledge is knowledge

46:40.120 --> 46:41.840
not by means of anything else.

46:43.040 --> 46:45.880
Wherever there's mediation, there's determinacy.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.240
Being one thing and not being another.

46:49.240 --> 46:52.040
So if there's no immediacy, there's no mediation,

46:52.040 --> 46:53.520
there's no determinacy.

46:53.520 --> 46:55.960
So I don't know this as opposed to something else.

46:55.960 --> 46:57.080
I just know this.

46:57.080 --> 47:00.800
So how do I know this if I see it for the first time?

47:02.040 --> 47:03.920
That's what knowing is.

47:03.920 --> 47:06.400
So you're assuming that to know this,

47:06.400 --> 47:07.960
I need to know what it is.

47:07.960 --> 47:09.600
I need to bring it under a concept.

47:09.600 --> 47:11.720
Sensuous certainty is denying.

47:11.720 --> 47:16.040
Sensuous certainty says, this is knowledge.

47:18.280 --> 47:20.280
And so is this.

47:20.280 --> 47:22.800
And so is this, yeah.

47:22.800 --> 47:26.240
Isn't starting with immediate knowledge a kind of immediacy?

47:26.240 --> 47:29.400
Because we're starting with immediacy

47:29.400 --> 47:31.320
rather than mediacy.

47:31.320 --> 47:32.200
Okay, great.

47:32.200 --> 47:33.960
So that is gonna be the question.

47:33.960 --> 47:35.880
So hold on to that question

47:35.880 --> 47:38.480
until we get to the beginning of the science of logic.

47:38.480 --> 47:39.920
Because I agree with you.

47:39.920 --> 47:42.600
And I think that's the way we save

47:42.600 --> 47:43.640
Pedagorean philosophy.

47:46.080 --> 47:47.480
Yeah.

47:47.480 --> 47:49.320
In the first like, I know or something,

47:49.320 --> 47:51.720
it's like, it's as conceptualizing

47:51.840 --> 47:54.880
and in the footnote is as conceptually comprehending.

47:54.880 --> 47:56.960
Oh, yeah.

47:56.960 --> 47:59.880
That's because Terry Pinkard loves to insert

47:59.880 --> 48:02.880
his own interpretations into the translation.

48:03.880 --> 48:06.520
Which is, so let me just, I'm actually not seeing,

48:06.520 --> 48:08.440
where is the footnote actually?

48:08.440 --> 48:10.600
It's on the first page and.

48:10.600 --> 48:12.120
Yeah, but what sentence does it modify?

48:12.120 --> 48:12.960
I have so many.

48:12.960 --> 48:16.120
It's the last sentence of 90.

48:16.120 --> 48:16.960
The last sentence.

48:16.960 --> 48:19.000
Oh, conceptualizing.

48:19.000 --> 48:21.360
Yeah, so let's see what that is.

48:21.360 --> 48:23.760
That's almost certainly gonna be Begrifen.

48:24.760 --> 48:27.120
And Terry loves to translate Begrifen

48:27.120 --> 48:30.520
as conceptually comprehending, which is hilarious.

48:30.520 --> 48:31.760
Yeah, it's Begrifen.

48:31.760 --> 48:36.600
Okay, Begrifen just means comprehending or conceptualizing.

48:36.600 --> 48:38.440
It doesn't mean both.

48:38.440 --> 48:40.560
That is to say, basic rule of translation.

48:40.560 --> 48:43.240
Where there's one word, don't translate it as two words.

48:43.240 --> 48:45.520
Okay, like that just doesn't work.

48:45.520 --> 48:50.520
Okay, so what that should really be is comprehending.

48:52.200 --> 48:55.080
Okay, now the reason he's translated

48:55.080 --> 48:56.960
as conceptually comprehending,

48:56.960 --> 48:58.720
this is in German, Begrifen,

49:01.640 --> 49:05.400
is the word in German for concept is Begrif.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.800
That's what a concept is.

49:09.920 --> 49:12.600
Which is the noun form of the verb Begrifen,

49:12.600 --> 49:14.320
which is also to grasp.

49:14.320 --> 49:16.320
So Begrifen is also a grasping.

49:17.320 --> 49:19.920
So in some ways, obviously it's a conceptualizing.

49:20.920 --> 49:24.760
But in general, the closest thing in English to Begrifen

49:24.760 --> 49:26.400
in philosophical texts is comprehending,

49:26.400 --> 49:27.760
comprehending something.

49:27.760 --> 49:29.280
So you should just translate it as comprehending.

49:29.280 --> 49:32.120
Or you could translate it as conceptualizing,

49:32.120 --> 49:33.440
but you do not wanna translate it

49:33.440 --> 49:35.080
as conceptually comprehending.

49:35.080 --> 49:37.880
That's just adding complexity that's not in the original.

49:37.880 --> 49:40.520
Okay, so what Hegel is saying is

49:40.520 --> 49:43.360
we must not conceptualize this thing.

49:44.360 --> 49:49.360
Any, our job is to just ask what sensuous certainty says

49:52.120 --> 49:56.600
about itself, not to bring our own concepts to bear

49:56.600 --> 49:59.600
on and make sensuous certainty

49:59.600 --> 50:01.640
into something that we think it should be.

50:02.640 --> 50:06.040
Okay, so now going further,

50:06.040 --> 50:09.080
we're gonna skip 92, the end of 93.

50:09.080 --> 50:14.080
The I, a knowing that knows the object only

50:16.040 --> 50:18.560
for the reason that the object is,

50:18.560 --> 50:22.280
but which itself can just as well be as not be.

50:22.280 --> 50:25.280
So that means, so just to anticipate,

50:25.280 --> 50:28.760
sensuous certainty is gonna undergo various changes

50:28.760 --> 50:31.440
over the course of this chapter.

50:31.440 --> 50:33.760
So Hegel begins by talking about

50:33.760 --> 50:36.520
just the bare abstract idea,

50:36.560 --> 50:37.920
or I'm sorry, just you start someone

50:37.920 --> 50:39.280
by talking sensuous certainty,

50:39.280 --> 50:42.640
and then imminently criticizes it.

50:42.640 --> 50:45.600
And then sensuous, he allows sensuous certainty

50:45.600 --> 50:49.520
to modify itself in light of those imminent criticisms

50:49.520 --> 50:51.960
while remaining sensuous certainty.

50:51.960 --> 50:54.680
So the first form of sensuous certainty

50:54.680 --> 50:57.280
is one on which, in Hegelian terms,

50:57.280 --> 51:00.520
the object, this, is the essence.

51:00.520 --> 51:05.520
That means the object determines what it is to know it,

51:05.520 --> 51:07.920
which means the object can be there

51:09.080 --> 51:10.720
whether or not the subject is,

51:10.720 --> 51:13.800
or the subject is purely receptive in knowing the object.

51:14.680 --> 51:18.360
So the I, a knowing that knows the object

51:18.360 --> 51:20.840
only for the reason that the object is,

51:20.840 --> 51:23.960
but which itself can just as well be as not be.

51:23.960 --> 51:27.960
So the knowing can be or not be, and the object still is.

51:27.960 --> 51:32.400
However the object is, it is the true and the essence.

51:32.400 --> 51:35.960
The object is indifferent as to whether it's known or not.

51:35.960 --> 51:38.920
The object remains even when it is not known,

51:38.920 --> 51:42.160
but if the object does not exist, then there is no known.

51:43.680 --> 51:46.680
The object is therefore to be considered

51:46.680 --> 51:50.240
in terms of whether, in sensuous certainty itself,

51:50.240 --> 51:52.840
it is in fact the kind of essence

51:52.840 --> 51:56.320
which sensuous certainty passes it off as being.

51:56.320 --> 51:59.600
That is to say, is immediate,

51:59.720 --> 52:03.200
is immediate knowing a way of knowing this?

52:03.200 --> 52:04.120
That's the question,

52:04.120 --> 52:07.080
because that's what sensuous certainty says it is.

52:07.080 --> 52:09.800
That is, it is to be considered as to whether this,

52:09.800 --> 52:14.280
its concept, its conception of itself,

52:14.280 --> 52:17.280
the object and the being of the object forehead,

52:17.280 --> 52:18.800
which is to be the essence,

52:18.800 --> 52:22.000
corresponds to the way it is present within that certainty.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.920
To that end, we need not reflect on the object

52:24.920 --> 52:27.240
and mull over what it might be in truth.

52:27.240 --> 52:29.960
We need only to consider it as sensuous certainty

52:29.960 --> 52:32.200
has it in sensuous certainty itself.

52:32.200 --> 52:34.840
That is to say, we just have to do this imminently

52:34.840 --> 52:37.800
rather than transcendently, non-imminently,

52:37.800 --> 52:39.720
applying our own criteria to value.

52:41.000 --> 52:44.200
Therefore, sensuous certainty itself is to be asked,

52:44.200 --> 52:46.280
what is this?

52:46.280 --> 52:49.480
If we take it in the twofold shape of its being

52:49.480 --> 52:51.640
as the now and the here,

52:51.640 --> 52:55.840
so one interesting thing about the phenomenology

52:55.840 --> 52:59.280
is Hegel assumes from page one

52:59.280 --> 53:01.640
that consciousness is consciousness

53:01.640 --> 53:03.040
of objects in space and time.

53:04.840 --> 53:07.640
So whatever the project of the phenomenology is,

53:07.640 --> 53:11.040
he's not trying to answer the skeptic who's like,

53:11.040 --> 53:13.680
I didn't say anything about space and time.

53:14.680 --> 53:17.760
And as we'll see, he even assumes some very natural things

53:17.760 --> 53:19.640
about the structure of space and time,

53:19.640 --> 53:21.920
namely that it's divisible.

53:22.920 --> 53:27.400
So whatever the phenomenology is supposed to do,

53:27.400 --> 53:30.280
it's not supposed to refute the skeptic

53:30.280 --> 53:34.080
who denies that objects outside the mind

53:34.080 --> 53:35.320
are in space and time,

53:35.320 --> 53:37.960
nor is it supposed to derive space and time

53:37.960 --> 53:40.040
from something more fundamental,

53:40.040 --> 53:43.280
which weirdly is part of the project of the Hegel system.

53:45.160 --> 53:46.000
Notoriously.

53:46.920 --> 53:50.800
So what I know can be characterized just purely imminently.

53:50.800 --> 53:52.760
We're just unfolding what's sent to a certainty.

53:52.760 --> 53:54.400
What I know is this here now,

53:56.680 --> 53:58.840
if we take it in the twofold shape of its being

53:58.840 --> 54:00.280
as the now and here,

54:00.280 --> 54:02.200
then the dialectic,

54:02.200 --> 54:04.000
where the, remember the dialectic

54:04.000 --> 54:06.640
is the internal imminent dialectic

54:06.640 --> 54:08.320
of a Hegel consciousness,

54:08.320 --> 54:11.560
where it generates contradictions of itself

54:11.560 --> 54:13.680
and tries to resolve them.

54:13.680 --> 54:16.360
The dialectic, which it has in itself,

54:16.360 --> 54:20.200
will take on a form as intelligible as the this itself.

54:20.200 --> 54:23.640
To the question, what is the now?

54:23.640 --> 54:27.120
We answer, for example, the now is the night.

54:27.120 --> 54:28.400
So if we ask sensuous conscious,

54:28.400 --> 54:31.200
so this is a slightly artificial example

54:31.200 --> 54:32.360
that Hegel uses to make a point.

54:32.360 --> 54:33.760
So I'll just read it and then I'll explain

54:33.760 --> 54:35.080
what the point is.

54:35.080 --> 54:37.820
We answer, for example, the now is night.

54:37.820 --> 54:40.080
In order to put the truth of this sensuous certainty

54:40.080 --> 54:42.800
to the test, a simple experiment will suffice.

54:42.800 --> 54:44.480
We write down this truth.

54:44.480 --> 54:47.480
A truth cannot be lost by being written down anymore

54:47.480 --> 54:49.800
than it can be lost by our preserving it.

54:49.800 --> 54:53.600
And if now, this midday, we look at this truth,

54:53.600 --> 54:55.200
which has been written down,

54:55.200 --> 54:58.120
we will have to say that it has become rather staged.

54:58.120 --> 55:01.560
Okay, so the idea is the sentence,

55:08.160 --> 55:09.320
now is night.

55:19.800 --> 55:24.800
Is true, say, at 11 p.m. and is false at 2 p.m.

55:36.600 --> 55:41.600
So what Hegel is doing is arguing that

55:41.600 --> 55:46.600
in so far as sensuous certainty

55:49.200 --> 55:52.900
says that knowledge is I know this here now,

55:55.680 --> 56:00.280
it cannot make sense of now.

56:01.320 --> 56:02.680
Why?

56:02.680 --> 56:06.860
Because Hegel argues in the next paragraph

56:06.860 --> 56:10.240
that now is a universal.

56:10.240 --> 56:15.240
That is to say, it applies to multiple different times.

56:16.000 --> 56:21.000
It applies to every time at the time at which it's uttered.

56:21.080 --> 56:24.160
So for any time, now uttered at that time

56:24.160 --> 56:25.300
refers to that time.

56:26.200 --> 56:31.200
Now refers to noon, 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.

56:33.440 --> 56:38.160
Okay, now why would it be bad

56:38.160 --> 56:41.660
if the object of knowledge for sensuous certainty

56:41.660 --> 56:42.780
were a universal?

56:43.680 --> 56:48.680
It would be bad because a universal is a one over a minute.

56:50.460 --> 56:53.000
It applies to multiple particulars.

56:54.520 --> 56:59.520
But that means it is distinct from the particulars

56:59.740 --> 57:03.500
it applies to, and they are distinct from one another,

57:04.500 --> 57:09.500
which means that to know a universal requires determinancy.

57:13.260 --> 57:15.980
This is determinately this rather than that,

57:15.980 --> 57:18.220
and determinately a particular rather than a universal,

57:18.220 --> 57:20.580
and a universal is a determinately a universal

57:20.580 --> 57:22.460
rather than a particular.

57:22.460 --> 57:26.820
That means knowledge of a universal requires mediation.

57:27.900 --> 57:29.700
You know what a universal is

57:29.700 --> 57:32.740
by means of knowing it isn't a particular,

57:32.780 --> 57:34.980
namely the things that it can instantiate.

57:34.980 --> 57:37.580
But there can't be anything immediate

57:37.580 --> 57:40.000
in the object of sensuous certainty,

57:40.000 --> 57:43.840
so this cannot characterize its object.

57:44.780 --> 57:46.780
Now in contemporary philosophy,

57:46.780 --> 57:50.180
it's very weird to think of now as a universal.

57:51.220 --> 57:53.900
If you said that in contemporary philosophy of language,

57:53.900 --> 57:55.660
class, Imogen Dickey would kill you.

57:56.740 --> 58:00.140
So the more natural thing is to think of it now

58:00.140 --> 58:01.940
as what we call an indexical.

58:02.740 --> 58:07.460
Which is to say, something that refers to different things

58:07.460 --> 58:10.740
under different contexts of utterances, contexts of utterance.

58:10.740 --> 58:15.740
So now, as uttered at time t,

58:21.020 --> 58:24.840
refers to time t.

58:26.540 --> 58:28.300
So that's the more contemporary way

58:28.300 --> 58:30.980
of expressing the nature of now.

58:31.020 --> 58:33.500
That it's an indexical rather than a universal.

58:33.500 --> 58:35.940
But Hegel's point remains,

58:35.940 --> 58:39.660
because this also requires the difference

58:39.660 --> 58:42.420
between individual times

58:42.420 --> 58:46.220
and a general quantifier over times.

58:46.220 --> 58:48.720
This says for all times,

58:51.340 --> 58:54.680
so in order for sensuous certainty

58:54.680 --> 58:57.540
to have an indexical expression

58:57.540 --> 58:59.540
in the objects of its knowledge,

58:59.540 --> 59:03.020
it would have to understand indexicals.

59:03.940 --> 59:07.840
Which involves understanding that one expression

59:07.840 --> 59:10.740
can refer to different things at different times.

59:10.740 --> 59:15.240
That requires determinacy, requires mediation.

59:16.100 --> 59:21.100
So the same argument eliminates the indexical now

59:22.180 --> 59:24.260
from being within the content

59:24.260 --> 59:26.260
of sensuous certainty's knowledge.

59:26.260 --> 59:31.260
The same arises for Hugh,

59:32.580 --> 59:34.100
as Hegel goes on to say.

59:35.980 --> 59:40.620
We also express the sensuous, this is 98.

59:40.620 --> 59:44.140
The same case comes up in the other form of the this,

59:44.140 --> 59:45.900
namely in the here.

59:45.900 --> 59:48.460
For example, here is the tree.

59:48.460 --> 59:50.780
I turn around this truth vanishes,

59:50.780 --> 59:53.500
and it has inverted itself into its contrary.

59:53.500 --> 59:56.600
Here there is not a tree, but rather a house.

59:56.600 --> 59:58.780
The here itself does not disappear,

59:58.780 --> 01:00:01.460
rather it endures in the disappearance of the house,

01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:04.460
the tree, and it is indifferent to being a house, a tree.

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:07.900
But this shows itself again to be a mediated simplicity

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:09.180
or as being universality.

01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:12.760
So once again, Hegel thinks of here as a universal.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:15.420
That's slightly odd in a contemporary perspective

01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:17.120
to think that here is a universal

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:20.220
that's instantiated by every location.

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.540
It's more natural to think of it

01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:26.540
as a indexical for all locations L.

01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:35.420
As utter at L refers to L.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:45.500
If you want me to write out the clause for this.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.700
So the problem with this, right,

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:48.600
is it depends on where you're pointing.

01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.900
And a disgraced former colleague of mine,

01:00:50.940 --> 01:00:52.740
Colin McGinn, has this famous paper

01:00:52.740 --> 01:00:54.540
where he tries to settle the question

01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:57.700
exactly which object is referred to by pointing.

01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:01.500
And so he literally has in this paper a diagram of a hand.

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:03.900
And then there's this question of like,

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.340
well, it's obviously, it doesn't have to be exactly.

01:01:06.340 --> 01:01:09.900
So like, you know, there's like a cone of reference

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:11.720
and there's like an empirical question,

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.700
what is the angle theta?

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:17.720
Like if I say, can I say this

01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:19.100
and be referring to the lectern?

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:20.580
No, it's too far away.

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:23.040
There, can I be referring to the lectern?

01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:25.020
Questionable, definitely.

01:01:25.020 --> 01:01:27.620
So somewhere there's this vague boundary

01:01:27.620 --> 01:01:30.240
of the theta of reference.

01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:31.580
This is what, okay, this is what people

01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:33.380
like Colin McGinn spend their time doing.

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:36.540
Okay.

01:01:37.700 --> 01:01:39.980
The fact that it was a hand is deeply ironic.

01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:41.340
Okay.

01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:46.340
So even if we think of here as an indexical

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.820
expression rather than a universal,

01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.780
the same point applies.

01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:59.240
Because this requires there being a distinction

01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.900
between the general term location

01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.780
and the individual locations.

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.820
That is to say, since you're certain

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:10.020
you would have to understand differences among locations

01:02:10.020 --> 01:02:15.020
and the difference between a location

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:17.500
and the general term location.

01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:21.860
That requires, that is determinate

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:23.220
and that means it's median.

01:02:24.860 --> 01:02:27.580
You understand one thing via an object.

01:02:27.580 --> 01:02:28.500
And it can't do that.

01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:32.340
So it also can't have here in the content of what it knows.

01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:34.260
Yes.

01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:35.300
Doesn't the,

01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.780
Colin, thinking of knowledge as a knowledgeable object

01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:44.040
already presumed like a distinction between objects

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:46.260
rather than just being an object,

01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:48.740
which to say now is night I feel

01:02:48.740 --> 01:02:51.380
it's already kind of giving some certainty,

01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:54.380
something that's uncertainty has already denounced.

01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:56.660
Now is not, it just is, isn't it?

01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:57.620
Exactly.

01:02:57.620 --> 01:03:01.360
And that means that either,

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:07.420
so what you're really showing is

01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.860
sense certainty shouldn't even be talking

01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:12.820
about here and now.

01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.500
It should just say, I know this.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:17.980
Or if it wants to say here and now,

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:24.780
it should just refuse to look at any other objects

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:25.860
or at any other time.

01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:28.520
That is to say, it should say,

01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.580
what I know is this here now,

01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:34.020
don't tell me about any other objects or at any other times.

01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:37.220
I'm saying it shouldn't even recognize other objects.

01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:38.960
It just exists.

01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:39.800
Exactly.

01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:43.000
So Hegel's going to modify sensuous certainty

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.160
to answer his own objection in the direction

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.200
that you're indicating.

01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:48.040
Okay.

01:03:48.040 --> 01:03:48.880
Yeah.

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.880
So this situation of I determines universal of no.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:02.240
So now in time, so now as P1 or P2 or P3

01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:04.840
is dependent on my situation.

01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:07.960
Yeah, so Hegel's going to do exactly the same move

01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:10.560
with I in one second.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:12.760
Because I is also an index.

01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:15.160
That is to say, in his terms, it's a universal.

01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:18.240
We would think of it more naturally as an index.

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.400
But before we got there,

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.920
Hegel said something really important in 97.

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:28.460
We also express the sensuous as a universal,

01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:30.500
but we say is this,

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:32.680
i.e. the universal this,

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:35.360
or we say it is, i.e. being as such.

01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.320
Let's leave the being theme aside.

01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.200
We thereby, of course, do not represent to ourselves

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:43.480
the universal, this for being as such,

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.720
but we express the universal.

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.760
Or in this sensuous certainty,

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.840
we do not at all say what we mean.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.520
So there's a distinction,

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.880
this is totally central to sensuous certainty

01:04:55.880 --> 01:05:00.880
between what we say and what we mean,

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.040
by which Hegel means what we intend to say.

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:10.840
So he's going to argue that what sensuous certainty

01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:15.520
intends to mean is this particular piece of chalk.

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.640
But what it actually says is the universal this.

01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:24.040
So it can't say what it means to say.

01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.800
So what sensuous certainty is trying to do is express

01:05:29.800 --> 01:05:32.520
that what it knows is particulars.

01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:37.680
But with only this here and now, it can't do that.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:40.360
Because Hegel will argue over the course of the chapter,

01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.040
to know a particular, you have to have both

01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:47.200
something like this here and now,

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:50.800
call it an indexical, call it an intuition,

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:53.920
and a conception of a universal.

01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:58.000
You have to distinguish this from other particulars

01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.400
in terms of its properties.

01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:04.880
So sensuous certainty thinks of itself

01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:07.760
that it knows individual particulars.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:11.000
But what it says is, I know this,

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.480
and this is a universal.

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:17.480
Because that's this, that's this, that's this.

01:06:17.480 --> 01:06:19.080
Everything's at this.

01:06:19.080 --> 01:06:22.080
So if what it knows is this, it knows,

01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:25.960
rather than this.

01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:27.800
Yeah.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.320
I'm confused because I thought we are not,

01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:33.000
we're trying to not conceptualize in answering

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.560
for the sensuous certainty person.

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.640
But then we introduce the concept of a universal.

01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:44.720
Wouldn't they just not conceptualize that?

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.560
Right.

01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:52.720
So one background worry here is whether Hegel is

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:57.440
making sensuous certainty answer questions

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.160
that according to sensuous certainty's own concept

01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:02.120
of itself, it doesn't have to.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:02.960
Yeah.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:03.800
Okay.

01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:10.680
It's important to note that sensuous certainty

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.080
is not just mute.

01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:18.080
It's not like, this is not caveman consciousness.

01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:22.200
So it has a conception of itself of what it knows.

01:07:22.200 --> 01:07:26.200
Now, it can conceptualize its knowledge

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.280
without thinking that what it knows

01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:29.640
is a conceptualized object.

01:07:30.560 --> 01:07:33.640
So in order, the whole setup is that we're examining

01:07:33.640 --> 01:07:35.400
concepts of knowledge.

01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:38.200
So sensuous certainty has to have a concept of itself.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:43.760
But what it knows is the object,

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.480
and it knows it non-conceptually.

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:49.200
Which means the project of the phenomenology

01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:54.200
is not to take each conception of knowledge and then ask,

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:58.320
does that, or each shape of consciousness

01:07:58.320 --> 01:07:59.640
that has a conception of knowledge,

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.440
ask does that shape of consciousness

01:08:01.440 --> 01:08:04.120
know its conception of knowledge?

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.480
That is to say, we don't take the concept of knowledge

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.040
and put it on the object side.

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.360
Because sensuous certainty would immediately fail that.

01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.320
Because a concept of knowledge is conceptual.

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.320
So sensuous certainty doesn't think it knows

01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:17.720
its concept of knowledge.

01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:20.040
That's just what it says if you ask it.

01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.680
What I know is this.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.280
But your concept of knowledge is not a this,

01:08:23.320 --> 01:08:25.760
yeah, yeah, yeah, epistemology is kind of bullshit.

01:08:26.760 --> 01:08:28.320
It's not something that it knows.

01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.640
It's just how it answers.

01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:31.280
It's how it conceives of this.

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:33.080
And so it would be cheating, it would be cheap

01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.080
if we were like, well, you don't know that.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:38.000
It's supposed to be not cheating if what we say is,

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.200
that immediate knowledge isn't knowledge of that object.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.360
It's not the object that you intend to know,

01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.640
the object that you mean.

01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:47.080
The object that you say is something different.

01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:47.920
Yeah?

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.120
Well, why not start with the caveman consciousness?

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:53.800
Well, because it's really hard to argue with caveman, right?

01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.960
The epistemological version of,

01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:59.600
oh, I'm just a caveman lawyer, right?

01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:01.520
I, that was just a gesture and a joke.

01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:04.400
I didn't really know what I needed to tell you that through.

01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:09.400
Yeah, because caveman consciousness

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:12.840
sort of,

01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:20.040
by definition, doesn't have the conception of itself as knowledge.

01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:26.280
Okay, and that might mean, so background question,

01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:31.400
is Hegel assuming something to the effect that if you know,

01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:33.320
maybe you don't know you know,

01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:36.760
but you can coherently conceptualize your knowledge

01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.560
in a way that survives imminent dialectical critique?

01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:43.200
I think he is, potentially.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:48.200
Okay, so we've talked about 97 and 98, time check.

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:54.200
Let's take a 10 minute break.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.240
Consciousness, Hegel has raised these problems

01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:10.400
for sensuous certainty.

01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:16.280
Here and now are universals.

01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:21.400
Therefore, either what sensuous certainty knows

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.280
is the universal this,

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.120
which applies to absolutely everything.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:31.560
Or, insofar as it wants to know this,

01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:35.240
it can't use here or now to figure it out.

01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:39.600
Okay, now sensuous certainty modifies itself.

01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:42.880
And it modifies itself in the direction

01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:44.640
of making itself the essence.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:48.560
Now what that means is, it says,

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:53.000
okay, I determine what this is,

01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:56.520
because what is here or what is now,

01:10:56.520 --> 01:10:59.280
or what is this, is what is,

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.200
it is where I am, and when I am, and what I'm pointing to.

01:11:05.480 --> 01:11:09.120
So it tries to solve this problem of this here now

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.880
by anchoring the reference of this here and now to the I.

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:16.200
So I could write those out, those indexical expressions,

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.280
indexical clauses, using I, but I won't bother,

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.760
because we can all see what the problem is gonna be.

01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.760
The problem is going to be that I itself is an indexical.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.600
I, as uttered by any subject S, refers to S.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.000
So Hegel will say I is a universal.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:41.840
I refers indifferently to every subject that can say I.

01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.760
Or, if we take the more contemporary conception

01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.320
on which it's an indexical,

01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:54.360
that cannot be within the content of what consciousness knows.

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:58.480
Consciousness is explanation of how it knows its object

01:11:58.480 --> 01:11:59.760
cannot go by universals.

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:06.040
So now Hegel says that this is the bottom of 102,

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:09.800
oh he's saying 101, this just expresses this idea

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:12.480
of tying, of using the I to anchor

01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.880
the reference of here and now.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.960
Now is daytime, because I see it.

01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:19.320
Here is a tree for precisely the same reason,

01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.080
however sensuous certainty experiences

01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:23.520
in these relationships, the same dialectic

01:12:23.520 --> 01:12:25.760
as it did within the preceding relationships.

01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:29.240
I, this, see the tree and assert the tree to be tree,

01:12:29.240 --> 01:12:30.800
to be here.

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:32.760
Now, properly speaking, it doesn't assert anything

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.400
to be here, that's 8%.

01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.240
However, another I sees the house

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:39.360
and asserts that there is no tree here, but rather a house.

01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:41.480
Both truths have the same warrants,

01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:43.840
namely the immediacy of seeing and the surety

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:46.320
and the seerons, which both have about their knowing,

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.840
however one vanishes into the other.

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:52.400
So I see a house, Christa sees a tree,

01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.520
I see a house, I see a tree.

01:12:59.200 --> 01:13:01.080
They can't both be right.

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:04.320
And sensuous certainty, or let's see, I see a tree,

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.960
I see a non-tree, or I don't see a tree.

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.320
They can't both be right,

01:13:10.320 --> 01:13:13.000
and sensuous certainty doesn't have the means

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.680
to distinguish the two in the way we would by saying,

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:18.760
when I say I see a tree, it means Nick Stang sees a tree.

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.000
And when Christa says I see a non-tree,

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.560
it means Christa sees a tree,

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:24.800
because that would involve having the distinction

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:28.240
between the universal, one who can say I,

01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.640
and particular people who can say I.

01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:33.480
Okay, 102, the beginning of 102,

01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:35.880
I've already explained what's going on.

01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:38.760
So then at the very bottom of page 63,

01:13:38.760 --> 01:13:41.120
however much this demand is set before science

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.880
as its touchstone,

01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:45.160
a demand which it would surely not last out,

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:47.880
namely the deduce, construct, find a priori,

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.960
however one wishes to express it,

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:52.760
a so-called this thing, or this person,

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:55.520
still it is reasonable that the demand should state

01:13:55.520 --> 01:13:58.000
which of the many things this thing,

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.680
or which of the eyes this I means,

01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.840
but it is impossible to state this.

01:14:02.840 --> 01:14:05.840
So sensuous certainty says,

01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.920
what it knows is this here now,

01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:10.680
but it cannot, compatible with its own shape or consciousness,

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.960
say which thing it knows.

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:16.680
And so either it knows the universal,

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:19.160
which is what it says, but it doesn't want to say that,

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:20.720
it doesn't mean to say that,

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:22.880
or it needs to be modified.

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:27.520
Okay, 103, sensuous certainty therefore learns

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:30.640
from experience in the technical Hegelian sense

01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:34.080
that its essence is neither in the object nor in the eye,

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.720
and in the immediacy is in immediacy

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:39.600
of neither one or the other of them.

01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.000
For in both, what I mean is instead what is inessential,

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.760
and the object and eye are universals

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.280
in which the now and the human eye

01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.680
that me and do not endure are not.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:51.360
So it's tried making the object be essential,

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:53.280
a thing that determines what knowing is,

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:57.480
it's tried making itself the essential

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:00.400
by using it to anchor the reference of here and now,

01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.120
neither worked.

01:15:02.120 --> 01:15:05.200
We thereby come to posit the whole of sensuous certainty

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.320
itself as its essence,

01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.920
and no longer only as a moment of sensuous certainty

01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.600
as happened in both cases,

01:15:11.600 --> 01:15:13.200
in which at first the object approaches the eye,

01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:14.680
and the eye itself reaches supposed to be

01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.320
the reality of sensuous certainty.

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:19.080
It is thus only the whole of sensuous certainty itself,

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:21.240
which links tenaciously in such sensuous certainty

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.800
to immediacy, in which thereby excludes from itself

01:15:23.800 --> 01:15:26.240
all the opposition that took place in what proceeding.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:27.400
So sensuous certainty realizes,

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:30.120
okay, I tried making the object the essence,

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.000
I tried making myself the essence, neither worked.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.640
So you need to think of it,

01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:34.960
they're both essential or neither.

01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:38.320
I'm not gonna talk about essence anymore.

01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:41.320
So I'm just gonna take sensuous certainty itself.

01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.840
This situation of I know this,

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:46.560
that's gonna be the whole thing.

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:49.200
This pure immediacy therefore no longer has any concern

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.520
with the otherness of the here as a tree,

01:15:51.520 --> 01:15:53.360
which is a here that is a non-tree,

01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:55.640
nor with the otherness of now as daytime,

01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.840
and which passes over into a now that is night,

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:58.800
nor with another eye,

01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.720
for which something other is the object.

01:16:00.720 --> 01:16:03.240
So this new shape of self-consciousness,

01:16:03.240 --> 01:16:06.080
new shape of self-censored certainty claims,

01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:09.600
look, I know this, and if you raise any objections

01:16:09.600 --> 01:16:12.760
about trees or houses, things I don't know now,

01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:15.280
that isn't this, I'm going to ignore you.

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.800
Or you could think of this as episodic sensuous certainty.

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:23.200
This sensuous certainty knows this, now it knows this.

01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:27.720
And if you ask it, but now is the water bottle,

01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:31.000
now is the pencil is no longer true,

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.760
what are you talking about?

01:16:32.760 --> 01:16:34.560
So now it's immunized itself

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.560
against all of these Hegelian objections.

01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:39.760
So really these earlier Hegelian objections

01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:44.320
were just moves to get you to see the logic of the game.

01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:46.560
Because this is where sensuous certainty

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.120
should have started from.

01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:52.120
Because all of these problems that were brought in

01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:53.880
were really properly speaking things

01:16:53.880 --> 01:16:56.000
that sensuous certainty never claimed to them.

01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.640
Objects that weren't sensuously present to them,

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.080
like the tree when it was only perceiving the house,

01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.720
weren't only sensing the house.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:06.880
Like the daytime when now is night.

01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:08.440
And other eyes.

01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:10.760
So now sensuous certainty doesn't want to hear anything

01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.560
about a house when it's looking at a tree.

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:14.400
It doesn't want to hear anything about daytime

01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:15.240
when it's night.

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.800
And it doesn't want to hear anything about eyes.

01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:18.840
And if you raise that, it's going to tell you,

01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:20.080
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:22.240
None of that's knowledge, that's all bullshit.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:23.780
Don't.

01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:24.900
I just have one question.

01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:27.460
Is it maybe even when we're talking about something

01:17:27.460 --> 01:17:30.060
like this thing, you could call it an object?

01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:35.820
Or is it more just like a bundle of sense data or something?

01:17:35.820 --> 01:17:38.660
Bundle of sense data already brings in too much.

01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:43.220
And object is a super, super general notion.

01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:46.180
It's literally just the accusative.

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:51.580
That is to say, it's what consciousness is of.

01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:53.460
Whenever there's of-ness, there's an object.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:57.180
However much you use the word object, but OK.

01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:00.420
So at this stage, we're at the real caveman consciousness?

01:18:00.420 --> 01:18:03.460
Except that, unlike the caveman,

01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:06.660
it has a conception of its known.

01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:08.040
Otherwise, the whole project wouldn't go on.

01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.240
You cannot argue with cavemen.

01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:11.580
I mean, probably you could argue with cavemen.

01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:14.140
There's a great book about how it's called

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:17.060
The Dawn of Everything by Ray Rundland Groud.

01:18:17.060 --> 01:18:18.620
And the basic idea is we all think

01:18:18.620 --> 01:18:23.420
of a prehistoric, so-called hunter-gatherer,

01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:28.660
societies as really boring and life-having soft.

01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:32.100
But actually, it was probably way better.

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:35.100
It's just talking about consciousness

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:38.380
or the sense of certain telling us something.

01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:41.020
I just wonder, because in this book,

01:18:41.020 --> 01:18:44.580
there's a concept called cognitive impenetrability.

01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:48.420
It says that in perception, it just perception itself.

01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:49.980
It doesn't tell us anything.

01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:54.780
But some people also argue that we can actually

01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:58.260
perceive some high-order property in things,

01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:01.300
for example, like unity, identity, and so on.

01:19:01.300 --> 01:19:04.940
Yeah, so this conception, this model of consciousness

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:08.820
is several levels more primitive than anything

01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:11.060
you would find in contemporary analytic philosophy

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:12.620
or cognitive science.

01:19:12.620 --> 01:19:14.940
Because this has not been developed

01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:17.660
because it's plausible as an account of consciousness

01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:19.780
or because it's something that emerges naturally

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:21.300
from the sciences.

01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:26.300
It's been introduced purely to get the project started.

01:19:32.740 --> 01:19:36.580
This is way more primitive than any conception

01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:39.340
of perceptual consciousness that you will find

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:41.380
in contemporary literature.

01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:42.660
Let's just read a little bit further.

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:45.460
This pure immediacy, therefore, no longer has any concern

01:19:45.460 --> 01:19:47.460
with the otherness of the here as a tree,

01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:48.780
which is a here that is a non-tree,

01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:50.260
nor the otherness of now is daytime,

01:19:50.260 --> 01:19:52.060
which passes over into a now that is night,

01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:54.860
nor with another eye, for which something other is the object.

01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:58.180
Its truth is preserved as a self-consistent relation,

01:19:58.180 --> 01:20:00.100
which makes no difference of essentiality

01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:03.140
and non-essentiality between the eye and the object,

01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:05.020
and into which, therefore, no difference at all

01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:06.260
can force its entry.

01:20:06.260 --> 01:20:09.480
I, this eye, assert therefore that here is a tree.

01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:12.660
Once again, shouldn't say is a tree, just here.

01:20:12.660 --> 01:20:13.500
Happens to be a tree.

01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:14.980
And it's not the case that I turn around

01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:17.020
so that the here would become for me not a tree,

01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:18.500
or that I myself, at another time,

01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:19.980
take the here not to be a tree,

01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.480
the now not to be the daytime.

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:23.380
Rather, I am pure intuitive,

01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:26.220
and I stick with, namely, that now is daytime,

01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:28.580
or else I also stick with here is a tree.

01:20:28.580 --> 01:20:30.880
I also do not compare the here and the now themselves

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:31.720
with each other.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:34.220
Rather, I cling tenaciously to an immediate relation.

01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:35.380
Now it is daytime.

01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:39.480
So any of these previous or past experiences,

01:20:39.480 --> 01:20:41.280
any other objects in the environment,

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:44.300
any other subjects are now just being completely left out

01:20:44.300 --> 01:20:48.060
by sensuous certainty as objects of knowledge.

01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:51.480
Since the certainty itself no longer wishes to step forward

01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:53.340
when we draw its attention to a now that is night,

01:20:53.340 --> 01:20:54.720
or to an eye for which it is night,

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.940
we step up to it and let ourselves point

01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:58.380
to the now that is a certainty.

01:20:58.380 --> 01:21:00.300
So this angles, the metaphor is supposed to be,

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:03.340
we now take up the standpoint of sensuous certainty.

01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:06.300
We look out from the eyes of sensuous certainty.

01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:10.060
Thus we must enter into the same point of time or space,

01:21:10.060 --> 01:21:11.260
point it out to ourselves,

01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:13.540
allow ourselves to be made into the same eye

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.340
as that is a knowing uncertainty.

01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:17.960
Let us see therefore how what is immediate,

01:21:17.960 --> 01:21:20.900
which is pointed out to us is composed.

01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:23.700
Okay, so now Hegel first makes the point

01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:27.780
that he's going to make in 106 and 107 about time.

01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:28.820
And because it's about time,

01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:30.760
it's a little bit more complicated.

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.300
But I'll just say it about time,

01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:33.660
you'll get the basic structure of it,

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:35.900
and then we'll talk about space.

01:21:35.900 --> 01:21:38.980
So he first makes it about now, then he makes it about here.

01:21:38.980 --> 01:21:41.880
So the point about now is that I say,

01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:45.140
what I know is this here now,

01:21:46.800 --> 01:21:49.480
saying that takes a certain amount of time.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:53.440
And I haven't said it until I've said all of it.

01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:57.420
But by the time I've said it,

01:21:57.420 --> 01:21:59.020
what I intended to say,

01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:03.440
the object that I intended to say that I know

01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:06.240
the beginning of that no longer is.

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:10.840
Because if it did, if the object persisted,

01:22:10.880 --> 01:22:13.080
it would be a universal.

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.520
It would be a thing that's one over many.

01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:18.160
Not a property, but a thing that can exist

01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.800
at different times.

01:22:19.800 --> 01:22:22.520
And so for consciousness,

01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:25.960
to be able to give an account of why this here now

01:22:26.960 --> 01:22:30.520
refers either to the first moment of the thing,

01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:32.600
or the whole life of the thing,

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:35.280
it would be able to have to distinguish

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:36.760
the thing as a universal,

01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.520
or a thing that endures through time

01:22:38.560 --> 01:22:41.520
from its various moments of time.

01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.000
And that requires mediation.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:46.880
That requires a distinction among things.

01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:50.160
And that is not something that such a certain can know.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.060
So the idea is,

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:55.720
time is not,

01:22:57.160 --> 01:22:58.960
there's more than one moment of time.

01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:03.760
So Hegel's just assuming there's more than one moment of time.

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:07.280
Thinking the thought, what I know is this here now,

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:10.640
or what I know is this now, takes some time.

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:15.120
You haven't finished it until all that time has passed.

01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:21.420
But the object, the moment of time that began,

01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.680
no longer is, so either you're no longer able

01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:26.880
to refer to that moment of time,

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:30.160
or you're referring to a thing that persists through time,

01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:32.720
and that requires mediation.

01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:34.520
That requires the idea of a thing

01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.560
that exists at different times.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:40.800
Is Hegel also assuming time is infinitely divisible?

01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:43.600
I don't think he's assuming it's infinitely divisible.

01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:47.280
I think he's assuming it's divisible.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:51.200
But he might be assuming it's infinitely divisible.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:54.100
The most he's assuming is that it's orbital.

01:23:54.100 --> 01:23:55.400
He's infinitely divisible.

01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:57.040
He's not assuming it's infinitely divided.

01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:01.080
That is to say, there's always a smaller interval of time.

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.320
So that's the time point.

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:04.320
More complicated.

01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:06.440
The here point is much simpler.

01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:09.560
So 108.

01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:11.040
The here that has been pointed out

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.320
and to which I cling is likewise a this here,

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.000
which is in fact not this here,

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.280
but is rather an in front of and behind

01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:21.640
or an above and below or a right and left.

01:24:22.560 --> 01:24:26.880
So I refer to something that is spatially complex.

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:28.460
That is to say, has parts.

01:24:29.380 --> 01:24:31.960
The here, which is supposed to be pointed out,

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:35.520
vanishes into another here, but that one likewise vanishes.

01:24:36.520 --> 01:24:41.520
That is to say, here could refer,

01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:46.280
if I say here, that could refer to the whole object

01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:48.040
or refer to any of its parts.

01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:52.440
What is pointed out, held onto and which endures

01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:56.160
is a negative this, which only is as the here's are taken

01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:58.640
as they're supposed to be, but which in being so taken

01:24:58.640 --> 01:25:00.000
have sublated themselves.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.400
It is a simple summary of many years.

01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:05.240
Why did you guys do this to yourself?

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:09.160
You could have taken bioethics instead you're reading this.

01:25:09.160 --> 01:25:12.800
Okay, so what he means by that is

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.880
so he's assuming that physical objects

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:23.380
are spatially extended, so they have parts.

01:25:23.380 --> 01:25:25.280
The thing that sensuous surgery knows

01:25:25.280 --> 01:25:27.720
is a spatially complex object with parts.

01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:33.500
And that means that it's spatially universal.

01:25:33.540 --> 01:25:36.180
That is to say, it's in all of these parts.

01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:41.900
Which means that to be conscious of it

01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:46.440
as opposed to any of its parts requires mediation.

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:49.740
So why would I say this here, this here now,

01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:53.220
am I referring to the whole book rather than its parts?

01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:57.180
The only thing that could explain why my consciousness

01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:01.140
is of this whole book rather than its parts

01:26:01.140 --> 01:26:05.580
is because I'm aware of it as a book with parts

01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:07.560
rather than as the parts.

01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:11.460
I have to consciously separate it from its background,

01:26:11.460 --> 01:26:13.340
from its environment, and from its parts

01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:16.620
to be conscious of it as the whole object it is.

01:26:16.620 --> 01:26:19.260
The same problem applies if I want to be conscious

01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:21.380
of the page as opposed to the whole book,

01:26:21.380 --> 01:26:24.900
I have to be conscious of the page rather than the book.

01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:29.900
And that requires negation and that's a form of determinacy

01:26:30.020 --> 01:26:31.500
which is a form of mediation.

01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.900
And that is not allowed by essentially certainty.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:39.700
The here that is meant would be the point.

01:26:39.700 --> 01:26:42.780
However, the point is not, but rather as the point

01:26:42.780 --> 01:26:45.060
is demonstrated as existing, the demonstrating points

01:26:45.060 --> 01:26:47.260
to itself as showing itself to be not immediate knowing

01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:49.180
but instead of movement from out of the many years

01:26:49.180 --> 01:26:50.900
which we meant into the universal here,

01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:52.420
which is a simple plurality of years

01:26:52.420 --> 01:26:54.900
in the way that the daytime is a simple plurality of that.

01:26:54.900 --> 01:26:55.740
What does that mean?

01:26:55.740 --> 01:26:58.980
What that means is Hegel admits the existence

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:02.060
of spatial points, but they have their being

01:27:03.380 --> 01:27:07.900
in being the intersection of lines,

01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:11.700
which have their being in being the intersection of planes,

01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:14.620
which have their being in being the intersection of solids.

01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:17.940
That is to say, to be conscious of a point

01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:21.900
is mediated by consciousness of the line

01:27:21.900 --> 01:27:23.780
that intersects at that point.

01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:26.800
So consciousness of a point is totally okay,

01:27:26.800 --> 01:27:29.360
but it's immediate.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.960
Okay, now what is Hegel assuming

01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.880
about the composition of space here?

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:37.880
He's assuming that it is infinitely divisible

01:27:40.640 --> 01:27:42.640
because if there were,

01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.720
he seems to be assuming that it's infinitely divisible.

01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:49.240
I'd have to think about whether this argument

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.000
could work without that assumption,

01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:52.480
but he does seem to be assuming that.

01:27:52.480 --> 01:27:53.320
Okay.

01:27:54.320 --> 01:27:57.880
Okay, so the idea is sensuous certainty says,

01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.560
okay, look, forget all these other objects.

01:28:00.560 --> 01:28:02.040
All I know is this here now,

01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:07.640
but now why is its consciousness of the whole pencil

01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:09.960
rather than the tip of the pencil,

01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:10.960
the upper half of the pencil,

01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:12.560
the lower half of the pencil,

01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:14.960
the color of the pencil, et cetera?

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:17.280
The only thing that it could do that

01:28:17.280 --> 01:28:19.320
is because it's conscious of this thing

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.680
as a unity of parts,

01:28:21.560 --> 01:28:26.560
which means it has to have a conception of the whole

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.000
as opposed to the parts.

01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:31.520
That's just to say,

01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.520
it has to have mediacy within the content of its consciousness.

01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:43.120
Okay, so now to go back to this,

01:28:43.120 --> 01:28:46.040
so one of the classic worries

01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:50.120
about Hegel's critique of sensuous certainty

01:28:50.240 --> 01:28:53.440
is that he's putting in sensuous certainty

01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.720
the amount of things that sensuous certainty

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.300
doesn't have to say.

01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:59.800
This is Zopan's question about,

01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:01.960
it's caveman consciousness.

01:29:01.960 --> 01:29:05.720
Now, if sensuous certainty was literally just mute,

01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:08.840
like staring at things,

01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.880
without any conception of itself as knowing,

01:29:10.880 --> 01:29:13.320
obviously Hegel's critique would not be imminent,

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:16.200
but that just means that that can't possibly

01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:18.280
be the project of the world.

01:29:18.760 --> 01:29:23.440
So a shape of consciousness is a shape of consciousness.

01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:24.520
That is to say,

01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:27.060
it's something that has a conception of itself

01:29:27.060 --> 01:29:28.880
as relating to an object.

01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.720
That means it has to have a conception

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:35.920
of why its consciousness is a consciousness of its object.

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:43.160
And Hegel is assuming that the consciousness

01:29:43.160 --> 01:29:47.920
of the sensuous certainty's consciousness of its object,

01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:51.520
if that consciousness is not conceptually mediated,

01:29:51.520 --> 01:29:56.520
can't be a consciousness of a whole thing apart.

01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:04.480
Can you just explain what exactly the sensuous certainty

01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:07.880
person can afford to distinguish without concepts?

01:30:07.880 --> 01:30:09.360
Is it between particulars,

01:30:09.360 --> 01:30:12.120
or is it between the concept of a universal

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:14.760
and that of a particular?

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.640
So what it can say,

01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:19.840
so we're allowing it to say things in answer to us,

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:20.920
which involves concepts,

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:25.120
but what it can know involves no concepts.

01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:29.120
In sorry, it involves no universals.

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.480
All it knows is this here now.

01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:40.560
So he tries to avoid Hegel's critique

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:43.160
by claiming that this here now is not a universal

01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:45.040
because it doesn't care about the other instances,

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.360
it just cares about this.

01:30:47.240 --> 01:30:49.280
But Hegel's point is that even this,

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:51.160
being conscious of this,

01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:53.200
requires consciousness of a universal.

01:30:53.200 --> 01:30:56.320
It requires a consciousness of a one over man.

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:58.240
And that means it requires consciousness

01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:00.520
of the one as being distinct from them,

01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:04.600
which is determinism, and that's a kind of mediation.

01:31:06.600 --> 01:31:09.320
Now, let's go a little bit further.

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:15.560
109, it is clear both that the dialectic

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:19.760
of sensuous certainty is nothing but the simple history

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:23.040
of its movement that is its experience.

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:26.240
So the dialectic of sensuous certainty

01:31:26.240 --> 01:31:30.800
is just this sequence of experiences,

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:35.800
which is to say its awareness of apparent contradictions

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:39.720
between its consciousness of the object and the object

01:31:39.720 --> 01:31:41.440
and attempts to resolve them.

01:31:41.440 --> 01:31:43.640
And that sensuous certainty itself is nothing

01:31:43.640 --> 01:31:45.360
but just this history.

01:31:45.480 --> 01:31:47.280
So the shape of consciousness,

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:50.960
Hegel's now identifying with its own experience.

01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.600
Or sensuous certainty is,

01:31:52.600 --> 01:31:54.440
this is not something happening to sensuous certainty

01:31:54.440 --> 01:31:57.160
on that side, we're not doing anything to sensuous certainty.

01:31:57.160 --> 01:32:00.000
Sensuous certainty, just purely the concept

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:02.920
of sensuous certainty when thought thread

01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:04.680
generates these problems.

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:08.200
For that reason, natural consciousness also proceeds

01:32:08.200 --> 01:32:11.800
to this result, what is the true in sensuous certainty

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:13.920
to keep pressing the other forward.

01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:16.280
It learns from experience about it,

01:32:16.280 --> 01:32:18.560
but then it likewise forgets it,

01:32:18.560 --> 01:32:20.880
and then it starts the whole movement all over again

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.360
right from the beginning.

01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:23.760
It is thus a bit astonishing

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.600
when in the face of this experience,

01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:27.640
it is set up as a philosophical assertion,

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.320
whereas a universal experience,

01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:31.320
or even as the outcome of skepticism,

01:32:31.320 --> 01:32:34.960
that the reality or the being of external things as this

01:32:34.960 --> 01:32:39.760
or as sensuous is to have absolute truth for consciousness.

01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:44.760
Such an assertion does not say at,

01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:47.600
does not say at the same, does not at the same time

01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.160
know what it is saying.

01:32:49.160 --> 01:32:50.920
It does not know what it is saying,

01:32:50.920 --> 01:32:53.520
the opposite of what it wants to say.

01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:56.040
So sensuous certainty wants to say

01:32:56.040 --> 01:32:58.920
that the object of consciousness is the pencil

01:32:58.920 --> 01:33:02.600
in saying, all I know is this.

01:33:02.600 --> 01:33:05.840
But actually, this is a universal.

01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:09.160
In fact, this is the most abstract universal,

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:11.440
because everything is a this.

01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:14.720
So now, let me turn to the theme

01:33:17.440 --> 01:33:19.960
that I said I would talk about, which is being.

01:33:23.600 --> 01:33:28.600
So sensuous certainty's official view is I know this.

01:33:34.560 --> 01:33:37.440
Now Hegel sometimes says what it knows is,

01:33:37.440 --> 01:33:42.440
I know this is, but that makes the object of consciousness

01:33:44.160 --> 01:33:46.400
complex, that is to say there's a difference

01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:49.240
between the subject and the predicate.

01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:50.560
You can't have that.

01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:53.000
So we're properly speaking, what it knows is this.

01:33:55.920 --> 01:34:00.480
But we can also just characterize that object as it.

01:34:00.480 --> 01:34:04.120
What it knows is it, or being.

01:34:05.120 --> 01:34:10.680
Now the object of consciousness has to be completely immediate.

01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:20.120
Immediacy goes with indeterminacy.

01:34:20.120 --> 01:34:21.760
Why?

01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:30.920
Because immediacy is the same or goes with determinacy.

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:32.680
If something is determinate, it's

01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:34.680
one thing rather than another, it

01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:38.720
is what it is in virtue of what it is not.

01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:43.920
So if something has a determinate color, it's red.

01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:48.400
It's red in virtue of not being blue.

01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:51.240
Likewise, if something is mediated,

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:53.320
it has to be mediated by something else.

01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:56.480
So it has to be determinately, not that.

01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:59.120
Now, there is this thing called self-mediation in Hegel.

01:34:59.120 --> 01:35:00.920
Something can mediate itself.

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:03.680
But then there's a difference, there's

01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:08.280
determinacy between the role of the thing as mediator

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:10.600
and the very same thing as mediator.

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:12.080
So wherever there's mediation, there's

01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:14.840
determinacy, wherever there's determinacy, there's mediator.

01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:19.600
So wherever there's lack of mediacy,

01:35:19.600 --> 01:35:22.320
wherever there's immediacy, there's indeterminacy.

01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:26.000
So what if I know is this and it's immediate,

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.120
it's an indeterminate this.

01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:30.000
Now, this is all stuff that we are saying.

01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:32.680
This is not something that consciousness gets at.

01:35:32.680 --> 01:35:36.320
This is for us, not for some sensuous certainty.

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:40.440
What I know is the indeterminate this.

01:35:40.440 --> 01:35:42.840
So what sensuous certainty is saying

01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:46.880
is I know this, which is not just the cosmos.

01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:49.000
Because the cosmos is a determinate this.

01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.960
It's the most indeterminate possible this.

01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:55.840
Another way of putting that is what consciousness knows

01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:59.520
is not this determinate being, but completely indeterminate

01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:01.240
being.

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:07.360
What it knows is being, pure being.

01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.840
OK.

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:11.560
That means there's a structural parallel,

01:36:11.560 --> 01:36:13.760
this is just to anticipate a couple of things,

01:36:13.760 --> 01:36:15.760
between sensuous certainty and the beginning

01:36:15.760 --> 01:36:18.280
of the science of logic.

01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:20.600
The beginning of the first category of the science

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:22.480
of logic is pure being.

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:23.120
OK.

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:25.520
Now, question.

01:36:25.520 --> 01:36:28.800
I myself am not really sure what I want to say about this.

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:33.240
So Hegel draws a distinction between what sensuous certainty

01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:36.960
says and what it means.

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:41.680
What it says it knows is pure being,

01:36:41.680 --> 01:36:44.440
completely indeterminate being.

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:47.600
You take away all immediacy, you take all way determinacy.

01:36:47.600 --> 01:36:50.920
It's not that I know this being, because this being is

01:36:50.920 --> 01:36:53.680
this being, a virtue of not being, some other being.

01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:57.520
It's a determinate being, or a specific being,

01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.880
mediated by some other being.

01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:01.520
So completely immediate being, which

01:37:01.520 --> 01:37:05.280
is the absolutely pure, general being.

01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:07.560
Not just not even God, because God is traditionally

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:09.920
conceived of as a being, a very special being,

01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:13.200
but one being among others, just pure being.

01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:15.320
So what Hegel says is sensuous certainty

01:37:15.320 --> 01:37:17.960
says what it knows is pure being.

01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:24.040
But what it means is it knows this being, this particular

01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:24.520
being.

01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:31.240
And so this contrast, this conflict,

01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:35.120
shows that this form of consciousness is incoherent.

01:37:35.120 --> 01:37:38.800
But you could argue on behalf of sensuous certainty.

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:40.600
No.

01:37:40.600 --> 01:37:42.560
What you've shown is that sensuous certainty

01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:44.960
knows pure being.

01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:46.760
Now, I'm not sure what to do with that.

01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:53.000
And I want to leave this open, because one

01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:54.880
of the big problems in the science of logic

01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.680
is why, what entitles us to go beyond pure being?

01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:01.880
So why can't sensuous, why isn't Hegel just proven

01:38:01.880 --> 01:38:06.480
that what knowing is is the knowing of pure being?

01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:07.720
Done.

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:09.280
Book ends.

01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:19.240
Now, one thing that Hegel could say is, look,

01:38:19.240 --> 01:38:22.480
it might be that knowing is just the pure knowing

01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:23.840
of pure being.

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:26.760
But that's not sensuous.

01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:29.000
Whatever your access to pure being is,

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000
it's not through the senses.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:37.800
So that definitely is not what sensuous certainty means to me.

01:38:37.800 --> 01:38:40.520
It may be what it says, but it doesn't mean to me.

01:38:40.520 --> 01:38:42.240
So I just want to flag that.

01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:46.840
So this distinction between what sensuous certainty says

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:49.800
and what it means.

01:38:49.800 --> 01:38:54.440
So first of all, general irony of the phenomenology.

01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.800
What is for consciousness is not always

01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:58.320
the same as what is for us.

01:38:58.320 --> 01:39:02.200
So certain things will seem a certain way to consciousness,

01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:06.840
but the observer can see that it's not that way.

01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.960
Irony is when the apparent meaning

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:10.760
is different from the actual meaning.

01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:15.600
So Oedipus is like, why is there this plague affecting Athens?

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.400
Someone must have cured it in some terrible crime.

01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:18.200
I wonder who it is.

01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:20.480
And we're like, we all know why.

01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:23.160
So likewise, there's an irony here

01:39:23.160 --> 01:39:26.240
in that sensuous certainty thinks

01:39:26.240 --> 01:39:31.480
that what it knows is the super concrete sensuous particulars.

01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:35.760
What it really knows is the most abstract thing of all, pure being.

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:39.240
Now, the other thing, there's a sort of historical irony here

01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:46.840
in that there's a famous objection by this guy named

01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:52.320
Krug to basically Hegel and all of his pals,

01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:55.320
Fichte Schelling and Hegel, that these guys are just

01:39:55.320 --> 01:39:58.480
talking about these complete abstractions.

01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:00.480
This is all bullshit.

01:40:00.480 --> 01:40:03.000
The this is bullshit reaction to German idealism

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.080
has an excellent pedigree.

01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.240
The number one, the great advocate

01:40:08.240 --> 01:40:11.680
of the this is bullshit reaction is Schopenhauer.

01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:15.480
Unfortunately for Schopenhauer, his position is just Schelling's.

01:40:15.480 --> 01:40:18.480
So Schelling is bullshit.

01:40:21.400 --> 01:40:24.280
So when Krug says someplace, I can't remember where he says this.

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:27.560
He says, look, these guys talk about deducing all this stuff

01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.840
from pure self-conscious, just the concept of knowing.

01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.920
OK, I'll have you a challenge.

01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:35.000
Deduce this pen.

01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:39.360
So the idea is that in these systems of German idealism,

01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:42.120
we never get to concrete particulars,

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:46.000
that somehow they've erased all particularity or singularity

01:40:46.000 --> 01:40:48.360
in these super abstract notions.

01:40:48.360 --> 01:40:50.320
So the other irony of such uncertainty

01:40:50.320 --> 01:40:56.760
is Hegel is arguing that this, the thing that Krug

01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:58.760
is demanding a deduction of, the thing that's

01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:02.200
supposed to be the most concrete particular thing possible,

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.800
the German idealism could ever grasp

01:41:03.800 --> 01:41:08.360
is, in fact, the most abstract, purely.

01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:10.480
OK.

01:41:10.480 --> 01:41:14.400
Let me just think for a moment how much more I actually

01:41:14.400 --> 01:41:19.160
want to say.

01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:21.120
OK, questions.

01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:22.680
Yes.

01:41:22.680 --> 01:41:26.280
I still kind of wonder how those questions tell you something.

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:28.840
It doesn't be like your perception itself

01:41:28.840 --> 01:41:29.920
has already information.

01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:31.560
It's not like three sides.

01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:34.080
Or is it that I have this perception,

01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:37.480
but what it says, what it tells, involves

01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:41.840
some sort of inner tone, some kind of conceptualization.

01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:44.280
So you're asking the question that's

01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:45.840
not the question of phenomenology.

01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:49.280
You're asking the question, what is perceptual experience?

01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:50.680
The question of the phenomenology

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:55.200
is start with shapes of consciousness

01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:57.480
and then undermine them internally.

01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:59.440
So sensuous certainty, as I said before,

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:03.400
is not as complex as the thing you're taking into it.

01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:07.280
It's a philosopher's construct.

01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:13.040
It's just immediate sensuous apprehension of intent.

01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:17.520
It means, in particular, what it says is a universal.

01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:19.160
There were questions for you, Isaac.

01:42:19.160 --> 01:42:23.360
Yeah, so is the pure being here, Mass Hegel poet,

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:28.960
is that somewhat similar to Heidegger's being or not?

01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.480
So Tark and I taught a whole seminar about this.

01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:34.000
And I'm not sure what conclusion we came to.

01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:43.240
But there's no simple answer to that question.

01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:47.680
And insofar as there is one, the answer has to be no.

01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:52.320
Because being is what Dasein understands.

01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:55.840
And pure being for Hegel has no relationship

01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:58.000
to any particular being.

01:42:58.040 --> 01:42:59.720
It has to be more general than that.

01:42:59.720 --> 01:43:01.120
Yeah.

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:05.320
So if subject is purely receptive,

01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:12.480
how do we know the object that we perceive for first time?

01:43:12.480 --> 01:43:17.680
Once again, for sensuous certainty,

01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:22.360
knowing an object just is apprehending it.

01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:23.960
So when you see it for the first time,

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:26.280
you know it as well as you will ever know it,

01:43:26.280 --> 01:43:27.800
as well as you know anything.

01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:29.680
For the first time, for the second time,

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:33.560
those are only relevant if knowledge is something more

01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:36.040
than just apprehending something.

01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:39.760
More than just, I mean, and sensuous certainty

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:42.280
has a, when I say apprehension, has a superminable notion

01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:43.520
of apprehension.

01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:45.760
It's not even the Kantian thing where in apprehension,

01:43:45.760 --> 01:43:46.800
you have to combine some.

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.720
It's just like, boom, it's before you.

01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:58.200
The assumption or the premise implicit in your question

01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:02.400
that we know something less well the first time than later,

01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:05.920
assume that knowledge is a matter

01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:08.360
of accumulating information about something

01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:10.040
through further acquaintance with it.

01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:12.720
But that is not sense certainty's conception

01:44:12.720 --> 01:44:14.200
of what knowledge is.

01:44:14.200 --> 01:44:15.920
Sense certainty's conception of knowledge

01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:24.760
is in some ways, the more unfamiliar the thing is,

01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:25.840
the better.

01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:27.640
Because if it's unfamiliar, you're

01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:29.960
just going to be like, what is this?

01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:35.480
The first time you see a pencil, you don't know it any better

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:36.720
or any worse.

01:44:36.720 --> 01:44:40.200
So the subject comes through object?

01:44:40.200 --> 01:44:41.160
No.

01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:47.120
The subject is immediately sensibly aware of that.

01:44:47.120 --> 01:44:48.320
Yeah.

01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:55.240
So another question is that, is what conscience means

01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:57.840
identifiable to poor consciousness

01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:02.480
and what you says identify or is in a cell,

01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:04.800
is that identifiable or not really there

01:45:04.800 --> 01:45:08.320
to distinct separate, distinct distinct?

01:45:08.360 --> 01:45:11.560
I mean, insofar as there's a distinction emerges

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:17.880
between what it says and what it means,

01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:25.520
that has to become for consciousness.

01:45:25.520 --> 01:45:28.240
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a problem.

01:45:28.240 --> 01:45:32.120
All the problems have to be problems that eventually

01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:34.000
become for consciousness.

01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Even if when Hegel originally introduces them,

01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.920
they're not yet for consciousness but merely for us.

01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:45.720
But is what he says identifiable in the cell more like poor?

01:45:45.720 --> 01:45:49.520
But what it says, like I said, I don't think

01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:52.120
it should be identifiable with it.

01:45:52.120 --> 01:45:52.600
Yeah.

01:45:52.600 --> 01:45:53.960
Devanj?

01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:56.400
What does he mean when he says sublate?

01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:56.920
Oh, OK.

01:45:56.920 --> 01:45:59.640
I was hoping someone would not ask me that question.

01:45:59.640 --> 01:46:02.120
And the reason is, I think, so it's totally

01:46:02.120 --> 01:46:03.360
a central in Hegel.

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:06.440
I just think it's easier to understand in the logic

01:46:06.520 --> 01:46:09.040
because he has a whole discussion of it in the logic.

01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:12.680
So the word in German is aufheben.

01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:17.560
Now, aufheben, which is a separable prefix for those of you

01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:22.840
who are taking German, has two totally different meanings

01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:23.960
in German.

01:46:23.960 --> 01:46:27.960
It means both to lift something up, you have this aufgehogen.

01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:30.080
It also means to cancel something.

01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:34.040
So if you suspend a law, you've heben this auf.

01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:36.120
So Hegel loves the fact that there's

01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:40.400
this word that means two completely different things.

01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:43.600
Now, what he means by it is something

01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:47.920
is sublated aufgehogen.

01:46:47.920 --> 01:46:52.400
The verb is aufgehben, but the past part is it's aufgehogen.

01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:58.760
It's to sublate.

01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:00.120
This is sublated.

01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.680
OK.

01:47:06.680 --> 01:47:13.280
So something is sublated when it is canceled but preserved

01:47:13.280 --> 01:47:15.400
at a higher logical level.

01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:17.440
Now, what does that mean?

01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:22.960
What that means, we'll give you some sort of folk examples.

01:47:22.960 --> 01:47:28.840
So Hegel likes to say that the British monarch is sublated

01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:31.760
in the British Constitution because there's

01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:36.320
no monarch, because Charles, whatever his name is,

01:47:36.320 --> 01:47:39.200
your king, not mine.

01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:46.240
I am a subject of no kings, has no power.

01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:51.560
His ancestors would despise his current predicament.

01:47:51.560 --> 01:47:55.360
But he's still there.

01:47:55.360 --> 01:47:58.240
He's there in a transformed role.

01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:59.800
So he's both there and not there.

01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:02.000
OK, what does that mean?

01:48:02.000 --> 01:48:09.160
I think the better, the way to really answer this

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:09.800
is in the logic.

01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:12.280
I think it becomes much clearer in the logic.

01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:20.280
But yeah.

01:48:20.280 --> 01:48:26.120
So the idea of sublation is that when one shape of consciousness

01:48:26.120 --> 01:48:29.720
undermines itself and gives rise to the next,

01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:33.280
certain features of the first shape of consciousness

01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:36.240
are present in the second shape of consciousness.

01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:38.520
But they have a totally different meaning.

01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:40.440
They're like the British monarch.

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:44.600
It's a monarch, but in nothing like the original sense.

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:52.000
It's both canceled and lifted in the back.

01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:52.600
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:53.200
I keep missing you.

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:53.680
Sorry.

01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:55.320
Yeah, your name.

01:48:55.320 --> 01:48:55.800
Bowie.

01:48:55.800 --> 01:48:56.280
Bowie.

01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:56.800
OK.

01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:00.880
I want to ask about 103, 104, and 105.

01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:01.400
That's a lot.

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:02.240
No, no, no.

01:49:02.240 --> 01:49:05.440
But just basically, what does Hegel mean

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:09.000
when he says that the whole of the century's consciousness

01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.240
is its own essence?

01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:13.640
Because when he talks about I being its own essence,

01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:15.240
I mean, being the essence of the century,

01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:19.120
certainly he means that, oh, when I say now, it's my now.

01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:21.200
But what does it mean for the whole of the century?

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:24.840
So essence is an essentially contrasted concept.

01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:26.720
It's like being special.

01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:30.560
If everyone is special, no one is special.

01:49:30.560 --> 01:49:34.960
So if both moments of such uncertainty are the essence,

01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:37.360
then there's certainly neither of them.

01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:39.920
So what that means is it's not that I determine

01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:42.680
what the object of knowledge is, or the object

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:45.040
determines what knowledge is.

01:49:45.040 --> 01:49:47.400
We're not making these distinctions anymore.

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:50.960
So the move of using the eye to anchor the reference of this

01:49:50.960 --> 01:49:55.080
is out, because we're not considering any other of this.

01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:57.840
So really, the difference is that sensuous certainty

01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:04.440
originally was sort of non-punctual or non- it

01:50:04.440 --> 01:50:07.600
was willing to acknowledge that something outside

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:12.280
of a single knowing instance was knowledge.

01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:14.440
So you said, well, what about when you were perceiving

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:15.520
the tree rather than the house?

01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:16.960
Oh, OK, the answer to that.

01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:19.920
Now it just says, I don't know what you're talking about.

01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:23.480
That means sensuous certainty, once both subject and object

01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:26.160
are equally the essence, which means certainly neither of them

01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:34.680
are, that I feel like some of you are still

01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.800
stuck at that point about everyone's special knowing

01:50:36.800 --> 01:50:38.200
is because you're like, but wait,

01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:40.760
my third grade teacher told us we were all like,

01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:43.000
was she lying to me?

01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:43.500
Sorry.

01:50:48.200 --> 01:50:50.440
So the idea is, sensuous certainty,

01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:54.660
now that we've gotten this revised version of sensuous certainty

01:50:54.660 --> 01:50:59.480
that's revised it so in order to resolve these problems,

01:50:59.480 --> 01:51:02.240
it knows this.

01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:03.560
Now it knows this.

01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:05.480
And it knows nothing about that, and doesn't want

01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:06.680
to hear anything about that.

01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:08.000
And now it knows this.

01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.480
It doesn't know anything about that, doesn't want to hear about that.

01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:12.240
That's the idea.

01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:17.000
So it's giving up on any particular privilege in having it.

01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:19.000
Yeah.

01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:22.480
I'm wondering how exactly is sensuous certainty

01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:25.400
is the only conception of knowledge available to itself,

01:51:25.400 --> 01:51:27.880
like separate from itself?

01:51:27.880 --> 01:51:32.440
Like sensuous certainty can't separate between particular pieces?

01:51:32.440 --> 01:51:33.400
Yeah, so good.

01:51:33.400 --> 01:51:43.720
So the very idea of a conception of knowledge requires concepts.

01:51:43.720 --> 01:51:47.360
Therefore, it has to be able to conceptualize

01:51:47.360 --> 01:51:50.120
it's not.

01:51:50.120 --> 01:51:53.880
It has to be able to sort of say about itself what knowledge is,

01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:57.600
even if that doesn't go in the object of knowledge.

01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:01.680
Now the worry here, so we don't want,

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:04.240
so there's two extremes that we want to avoid.

01:52:04.240 --> 01:52:07.480
We want to avoid on the one hand what we've been calling caveman's.

01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:09.920
It's probably deep into a caveman, I apologize.

01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:13.160
Caveman consciousness, where it just knows an object,

01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:17.760
doesn't even have a conception of itself in it.

01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:19.880
It's probably more like animal consciousness.

01:52:19.880 --> 01:52:26.720
On the other hand, we want to avoid a consciousness,

01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:30.880
or shape of consciousness, that has a conceptually

01:52:30.880 --> 01:52:33.680
or articulate conception of knowledge,

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:36.040
but then doesn't think that that conceptually

01:52:36.040 --> 01:52:38.280
or articulate conception of knowledge

01:52:38.280 --> 01:52:41.040
is one of the objects of its knowledge,

01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:43.360
and can make the following move.

01:52:43.360 --> 01:52:49.200
It can say, oh, look, I can explain why the object of my knowledge

01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:51.640
is the pencil, rather than the parts of the pencil,

01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:54.360
by using concepts.

01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:58.000
But the object of my consciousness, the object of my knowledge,

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.520
is non-conception.

01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.240
You see what the problem is?

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:06.840
Because then it could answer Hegel's critique,

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:08.960
while remaining sensuous certainty

01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:11.360
in its conception of knowledge.

01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:15.560
So the worry is that sensuous certainty can answer Hegel's

01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:21.120
criticism by saying, oh, in my conceptually

01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:24.280
or articulate account of what knowledge is,

01:53:24.280 --> 01:53:27.840
I can explain why my consciousness is consciousness

01:53:27.840 --> 01:53:30.320
of this object rather than that object,

01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:33.120
even though none of the stuff that I just said

01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:36.080
can be among the objects of consciousness.

01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:38.040
And so we need a principled reason

01:53:38.040 --> 01:53:43.120
for locating sensuous certainty between the skill of caveman

01:53:43.120 --> 01:53:48.040
consciousness and the caribdis of overly conceptually

01:53:48.040 --> 01:53:52.160
sophisticated sensuous certainty.

01:53:52.160 --> 01:53:54.760
And it's possible.

01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:56.760
So I said before, one worry that people

01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:58.960
have had about sensuous certainty for a long time

01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:02.520
is Hegel is making sensuous certainty answer questions

01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:05.440
it doesn't have to answer or can't answer.

01:54:05.440 --> 01:54:08.080
That's sort of the worry about caveman consciousness.

01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:11.600
The worry about what I'm calling conceptually sophisticated

01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:16.920
sensuous certainty is it can answer Hegel's critique.

01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:20.040
But the material it uses to answer Hegel's critique

01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:22.280
doesn't go in the object of consciousness.

01:54:22.280 --> 01:54:23.820
It's not one of the things it knows,

01:54:23.820 --> 01:54:26.280
or one of the things it's conscious of.

01:54:26.280 --> 01:54:31.680
It's meta philosophical, or it's meta epistemological account

01:54:31.680 --> 01:54:35.040
of what the object of consciousness is.

01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:38.520
So fully defending Hegel would require explaining

01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:43.640
our principle way why that is not a legitimate move.

01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:47.400
Yes, so far.

01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:48.200
Sensuous search.

01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:50.480
So who is it fighting with?

01:54:50.480 --> 01:54:52.240
That's a phrase to use.

01:54:52.240 --> 01:54:53.080
It's some.

01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:53.600
OK.

01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:55.760
Yeah, it's some.

01:54:55.760 --> 01:54:56.280
Yes.

01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:58.520
Why can't universality or universality

01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:00.600
be known immediately?

01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:05.800
This is a sort of, so a universal can't be

01:55:05.800 --> 01:55:08.920
known as a universal immediately.

01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:11.280
Because to know something as a universal,

01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:15.400
you have to distinguish it from a predicament.

01:55:15.400 --> 01:55:18.480
So to be conscious of something as a universal,

01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:22.080
you have to be aware of it as a one over many.

01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:25.240
And that requires us distinct from the many.

01:55:25.240 --> 01:55:26.840
But why is it not the other way around?

01:55:26.840 --> 01:55:29.680
That you first understand this unity to things

01:55:29.680 --> 01:55:32.240
and then you can understand particulars.

01:55:32.240 --> 01:55:35.120
Why do we have to understand distinct particulars first

01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:38.080
in order to understand what a universal is?

01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:39.840
I mean, the same thing.

01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:41.680
I didn't say you have to understand the particulars

01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:42.160
first.

01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:44.240
To understand a particular is a particular.

01:55:44.240 --> 01:55:47.040
You also have to understand it as distinct from potentially

01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:50.640
other particulars and from universals that it realizes.

01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:54.760
So that's also media.

01:55:54.760 --> 01:56:02.880
So the immediate, the thing that you know immediately

01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:12.440
is this, which now, sensuous certainty doesn't say of it

01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:13.680
that it's a universal.

01:56:13.680 --> 01:56:16.240
Because it's not aware of it as a universal.

01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:20.360
We, the chronological observers, are aware of it as a universal.

01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:25.640
Let me ask, how many of you are totally lost?

01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:27.880
Raise your hand if you are totally lost.

01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:30.840
Someone, OK, there's 0% chance that only three of you

01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:32.040
are totally lost.

01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:32.800
Just be honest.

01:56:35.840 --> 01:56:36.680
OK.

01:56:36.680 --> 01:56:40.360
Someone who is totally lost, tell me

01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.480
the last place in which you were not lost.

01:56:44.480 --> 01:56:46.080
Where did you get lost?

01:56:46.080 --> 01:56:47.840
Someone we have not heard from yet.

01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:52.480
I saw some hands in the background.

01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:57.560
Anybody?

01:56:57.560 --> 01:56:58.760
OK, Krista.

01:56:58.760 --> 01:57:00.400
I'm not sure you're going to be like,

01:57:00.400 --> 01:57:03.320
I got lost at this place, which is way further along

01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:05.560
than where other people got lost.

01:57:05.560 --> 01:57:11.040
So how do we get to pure being and what

01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:13.680
sensory sense is pure being?

01:57:13.680 --> 01:57:16.040
So the way we get to pure being is, first of all,

01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:22.840
we just assume that the object of knowledge is what it is.

01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:24.520
You only know what it is.

01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:29.640
Now, sensuous certainty is immediate consciousness.

01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:34.400
That means what it is conscious of can't be determined.

01:57:34.400 --> 01:57:37.800
Because determinacy always involves idiomatic.

01:57:37.800 --> 01:57:41.240
That means it cannot be contrast of a particular being.

01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:47.920
That means it cannot be conscious of a determinate being,

01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:50.720
one being as opposed to another being.

01:57:50.720 --> 01:57:54.200
Because to be conscious of one being as opposed to another being,

01:57:54.200 --> 01:58:01.200
a determinate being, requires negation, which is a kind of mediation.

01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:04.680
That means because it's conscious of what is,

01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:07.040
because all knowledge is knowledge of what is,

01:58:07.040 --> 01:58:10.400
it's not knowledge of a determinate being,

01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:14.680
any determinate being, or even a very indeterminate being.

01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:20.240
It's conscious of indeterminate pure being without any determinacy.

01:58:20.240 --> 01:58:24.760
So pure being is not a very special being.

01:58:24.760 --> 01:58:27.600
It's not the universal being, because that

01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:31.200
would be determinate or universal rather than a particular.

01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:34.160
It's not God.

01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:37.800
It's not the so-called bear particular, because that's

01:58:37.800 --> 01:58:39.800
a particular rather than a universal.

01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:43.560
It's just being.

01:58:43.560 --> 01:58:47.960
It's what Parmenides is talking about.

01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:52.320
OK, I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:54.480
Did you say you were lost?

01:58:54.480 --> 01:58:55.960
Eventually, I didn't get lost.

01:58:55.960 --> 01:58:59.200
Do you want to tell me the last place where you were not lost?

01:58:59.200 --> 01:59:00.360
Did you trace your steps?

01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:02.360
No, I wasn't around the being thing.

01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:03.480
OK, that's great.

01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:06.920
If you only got lost at being, you're doing very good.

01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:10.480
Being is a very respectable place to get lost at.

01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:16.960
I got lost the move of using the eye to anchor this.

01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:24.600
So the idea is Hegel says, look, here and now are universals,

01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:29.400
because that's a here, that's a here, that's a here.

01:59:29.400 --> 01:59:31.200
Every time is a now.

01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:33.360
Consciousness says, OK, this is a version

01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:35.400
of making the indexical move.

01:59:35.400 --> 01:59:41.320
It says, here is wherever I am, and now

01:59:41.320 --> 01:59:43.360
is whenever I am speaking.

01:59:43.360 --> 01:59:45.040
OK, good.

01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:49.680
But now notice, I is also a universal or an indexical.

01:59:49.680 --> 01:59:52.520
You can say I, I can say I, everyone here can.

01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:55.960
I'm assuming everyone here can say I.

01:59:55.960 --> 02:00:00.240
That means that for consciousness to use that move,

02:00:00.240 --> 02:00:03.440
it has to distinguish its eye from other eyes.

02:00:03.440 --> 02:00:06.480
That is just as to say, I, as uttered by any speaker,

02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:10.400
S, refers to X. But that requires

02:00:10.400 --> 02:00:14.680
the difference between a particular instance

02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:19.080
of the variable and the general term binding the variable.

02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:20.760
And that's a version of the distinction

02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:22.400
between particulars and traversals.

02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:25.280
That requires negations.

02:00:25.280 --> 02:00:29.200
That's a form of determinacy, and it can't do that.

02:00:29.640 --> 02:00:31.720
Is the order a matter of whether Hegel

02:00:31.720 --> 02:00:33.880
does time first or space first?

02:00:33.880 --> 02:00:34.800
I don't think so.

02:00:34.800 --> 02:00:36.320
That's a good question.

02:00:36.320 --> 02:00:40.480
But he does time in both cases first, and I'm not sure why.

02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:42.560
Yes?

02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:43.920
No, you.

02:00:43.920 --> 02:00:48.720
Just why can't determination or distinction be given immediately?

02:00:48.720 --> 02:00:52.120
Because I feel like I can immediately see differences.

02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.040
This is a really good question, and it's

02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:57.960
totally foundational in Hegel that he doesn't think

02:00:57.960 --> 02:00:59.120
that it can be.

02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:04.800
Now, for a really good argument, we have not seen one yet.

02:01:04.800 --> 02:01:07.240
But the basic idea, it's in a certain way,

02:01:07.240 --> 02:01:09.640
it's a version of the Kantian points

02:01:09.640 --> 02:01:12.080
that the combination of the manifold

02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:14.920
is not given by the senses.

02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:19.480
If any immediate form of awareness,

02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:23.800
not by means of anything else, does not

02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:28.680
acquaint you with anything that's determinate.

02:01:28.680 --> 02:01:30.840
Determinately one way rather than another.

02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:33.600
For it to be determinately one way rather than another,

02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:37.560
you have to be aware of it as determinately one way

02:01:37.560 --> 02:01:38.440
rather than the other.

02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.040
And that means your awareness of it

02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:43.680
is that way is mediated by your awareness of the ways

02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:45.760
it might otherwise be.

02:01:45.760 --> 02:01:50.200
This is so foundational for Hegel.

02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:53.400
I'm not even sure he ever argued sort of.

02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:56.080
An immediate relation is a relation

02:01:56.080 --> 02:01:58.520
to something indeterminate.

02:01:58.520 --> 02:02:02.000
And that means all of the immediate stuff.

02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:06.320
So people in this period love appealing

02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:08.360
to immediate awareness of things.

02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:10.960
And the Hegelian move repeated over and over

02:02:10.960 --> 02:02:15.400
is that makes the object of your awareness totally indeterminate.

02:02:15.400 --> 02:02:17.400
OK, now here's a challenging question.

02:02:18.040 --> 02:02:25.200
Is any of this in sensual certainty a criticism of Kant?

02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:30.120
Does Kant have to disagree with any of any in sensual certainty?

02:02:33.800 --> 02:02:35.440
You want to take a stab at it?

02:02:35.440 --> 02:02:38.000
There might be a way in which if you read Kant's definition

02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.320
of intuition at the beginning, that this is just

02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:42.680
an attack on that conception, that you can be immediately

02:02:42.680 --> 02:02:44.520
related to the object.

02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:48.480
OK, so on one way of thinking about this,

02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:52.240
this is a criticism of Kant's notion of intuition.

02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:55.800
Because intuition is an immediate relation.

02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:58.320
And Kant thinks it's an immediate relation

02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:00.560
to a determinate object.

02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:04.880
That's the intuition of this object rather than another.

02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:12.440
But you could also think Kant completely

02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:18.360
agrees that in order for you to be conscious of your intuition

02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:20.480
as being of one object rather than another,

02:03:20.480 --> 02:03:23.600
you have to conceptualize it.

02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.600
So it's not at all clear that Kant

02:03:25.600 --> 02:03:29.760
has to disagree with it like this.

02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:36.360
So let me just repeat that line of thought very briefly.

02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:38.960
So one reading of Kant, which I don't think

02:03:38.960 --> 02:03:40.600
is a right reading but simply upheld,

02:03:40.600 --> 02:03:43.480
is that intuitions, because they are immediate,

02:03:43.480 --> 02:03:45.920
are completely indeterminate.

02:03:45.920 --> 02:03:50.320
The object of intuition without concept is just totally indeterminate.

02:03:50.320 --> 02:03:52.600
I think that doesn't make any sense in Kant.

02:03:52.600 --> 02:03:57.080
But if that's what Kant's view, then Hegel's just making his point forward.

02:03:57.080 --> 02:04:00.800
I think it's much more plausible that Kant thinks that intuition

02:04:00.800 --> 02:04:02.920
is an intuition of a determinate object.

02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:04.320
It's a particular object.

02:04:04.320 --> 02:04:05.680
It's an intuition of this object.

02:04:05.680 --> 02:04:09.520
It's not just an intuition of objects that are indeterminate.

02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:14.680
But Kant can, I think, acknowledge the point here by saying, oh, that's right.

02:04:14.680 --> 02:04:18.280
But in order for you to be conscious of that object of intuition

02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:23.920
as the object of that intuition, you need to conceptualize it.

02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:24.680
Yes?

02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:25.240
Yeah.

02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:28.920
Just one question about that last comparison between the two

02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:29.960
that you made.

02:04:29.960 --> 02:04:32.720
It seems to me when you're talking about the object for Hegel,

02:04:32.720 --> 02:04:35.680
that seems much more broad than the object for Kant.

02:04:35.680 --> 02:04:37.840
I think we would grant that the object does need

02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:39.440
to fall under concepts for Kant.

02:04:39.440 --> 02:04:45.440
But it seems like there are things that when Kant wouldn't consider an object,

02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:48.200
but you suggest that Hegel maybe would.

02:04:48.200 --> 02:04:49.960
And that would seem to maybe.

02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:53.120
So object at this point is supposed to be totally general.

02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:55.000
It's the object of consciousness.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:57.720
The only more specific notion of object that we've seen

02:04:57.720 --> 02:04:59.400
is the object of sensuous certainty.

02:04:59.400 --> 02:05:02.480
And that's quite determinate.

02:05:02.480 --> 02:05:05.440
It's intended to be a very determinate conception of an object.

02:05:05.440 --> 02:05:07.960
Something you can be sensuously certain of.

02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:10.240
You can't be sensuously certain of God.

02:05:10.240 --> 02:05:12.520
You can't be sensuously certain of the laws of nature.

02:05:12.520 --> 02:05:13.560
You don't sense them.

02:05:13.560 --> 02:05:16.280
You can't be sensuously certain of propositions inside of it.

02:05:16.280 --> 02:05:19.400
So we can see the most general possible notion of object at all,

02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:23.560
and an attempt at a highly determinate one, where the highly

02:05:23.560 --> 02:05:26.320
determinate one has Hegel or he's fate.

02:05:29.640 --> 02:05:33.680
I'm tempted to think that Kant would just say everything even concepts

02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:36.600
are immediate because of self-consciousness.

02:05:36.600 --> 02:05:42.240
So then there's no real problem for him that, for example,

02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:47.080
to think that we can't immediately know what universal means.

02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:50.280
Because everything's kind of immediate.

02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:54.040
Sorry, did you say immediate or immediate?

02:05:54.040 --> 02:05:55.320
Immediate.

02:05:55.320 --> 02:05:59.640
But Kant's conceptual representation is immediate representation.

02:05:59.640 --> 02:06:03.920
To have a concept is to represent something

02:06:03.920 --> 02:06:07.240
by means of the marks of that concept.

02:06:07.240 --> 02:06:13.400
So conceptual representation, as such, is immediate.

02:06:13.400 --> 02:06:17.760
What about just unity of app perception, the baseline?

02:06:17.760 --> 02:06:19.640
Is that kind of immediate?

02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:24.760
And from there, you can just know how things are like?

02:06:24.760 --> 02:06:29.080
So I'm immediately conscious of myself as combining.

02:06:29.080 --> 02:06:31.280
But in order for me to be conscious of anything,

02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:33.680
something has to be given to me in tuition.

02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:35.320
And I have to conceptualize it.

02:06:35.320 --> 02:06:39.120
So you're right, I'm immediately conscious of myself as acting.

02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:44.640
But what Hegel would say is that I is totally indeterminate.

02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:45.680
That's kind of the point.

02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:46.600
It's totally empty.

02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:48.120
The I has no content.

02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:51.500
So Hegel would actually think that, on that point,

02:06:51.500 --> 02:06:53.760
Kant completely agrees with it.

02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:57.960
But I'm worried that we're kind of losing everybody with Kant.

02:06:57.960 --> 02:06:59.120
Yes, sorry.

02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:02.480
Just one more comment.

02:07:02.480 --> 02:07:02.960
Great.

02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:04.040
I think it was all met.

02:07:04.040 --> 02:07:07.640
Is there an issue with Hegel's specific case in time

02:07:07.640 --> 02:07:11.000
as you adrift with it or not?

02:07:11.000 --> 02:07:12.120
Yes.

02:07:12.120 --> 02:07:19.200
Depending on how strongly, it depends on what

02:07:19.200 --> 02:07:21.800
Hegel means by calling space and time universal.

02:07:21.800 --> 02:07:25.400
I think all he means by universal is a one over met.

02:07:25.400 --> 02:07:28.560
And in that very minimal sense, space and time

02:07:28.560 --> 02:07:30.520
are ones over many in Kant.

02:07:30.520 --> 02:07:32.720
They're not conceptual universals.

02:07:32.720 --> 02:07:34.200
But yeah, that's a good question.

02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:38.400
I guess you repeat your indexical formulation

02:07:38.400 --> 02:07:40.320
of the universality of the I.

02:07:40.320 --> 02:07:41.200
Oh, absolutely.

02:07:43.880 --> 02:07:45.040
I would love to do that.

02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:47.680
OK.

02:07:47.680 --> 02:08:11.640
Or any speaker S I has uttered by mass refers to S.

02:08:11.640 --> 02:08:15.520
Seems unarguable.

02:08:15.520 --> 02:08:17.360
What did you learn today in philosophy class?

02:08:17.360 --> 02:08:21.200
Well, we learned whenever anyone says I, I refers to them,

02:08:21.200 --> 02:08:23.880
the person who said it.

02:08:23.880 --> 02:08:26.640
How much is the tuition of the school is?

02:08:26.640 --> 02:08:32.320
So the idea is notice that this requires

02:08:32.320 --> 02:08:35.560
a difference between the universal speaker

02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:38.440
and individual values of this variable.

02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:41.640
If we wrote this out, it would start with the quantifiable

02:08:41.640 --> 02:08:46.360
clause for all S. If S is a speaker,

02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:49.440
and that just has contained within it

02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:52.040
the difference between a particular and a universal,

02:08:52.040 --> 02:08:55.240
that involves mediation, it involves determinacy.

02:08:55.240 --> 02:08:59.040
None of that can be in the content of what

02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:01.160
sensuous certainty is conscious of.

02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:04.160
Now, the question that I was talking about before

02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:07.600
is whether it could be something sensuous certainty could

02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:13.360
say in order to explain the reference of its consciousness

02:09:13.360 --> 02:09:16.160
to an object, even though it's not something it's conscious of.

02:09:16.160 --> 02:09:17.960
And that gets into the difficult question of,

02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:20.280
how conceptually sophisticated are we

02:09:20.280 --> 02:09:22.840
allowed to make sensuous certainty?

02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:24.320
Willow, you have your head up.

02:09:24.320 --> 02:09:26.160
No, he's got 109.

02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:26.680
OK.

02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:27.840
I understood.

02:09:27.840 --> 02:09:30.880
Or are you going to ask me the series of Vakas?

02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:33.080
I mean, if you want to add it to it.

02:09:33.080 --> 02:09:34.000
You have to ask me.

02:09:34.000 --> 02:09:34.960
Sure, sure.

02:09:34.960 --> 02:09:36.000
Well, what are they?

02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:37.120
I just read off the bad.

02:09:37.120 --> 02:09:38.720
Well, they're Roman gods.

02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:39.240
You know that.

02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:39.560
There you go.

02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:40.320
Yes, I do know that.

02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:41.120
OK.

02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:42.200
That's not what I would do.

02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:42.700
OK.

02:09:42.860 --> 02:09:47.780
What I was curious about, anyway, was the so I understood you

02:09:47.780 --> 02:09:53.500
as saying that sensuous sort of, you know,

02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:55.500
says it knows pure being, but really knows

02:09:55.500 --> 02:09:57.900
this specific thing, this pencil, whatever.

02:09:57.900 --> 02:10:02.100
And then it's an issue that you can't know pure being

02:10:02.100 --> 02:10:04.100
through your senses and whatnot.

02:10:04.100 --> 02:10:05.980
Where does that come from?

02:10:05.980 --> 02:10:07.980
You know, you can't know it through your senses.

02:10:07.980 --> 02:10:10.620
That does seem obvious to me, but would this have to be given?

02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:15.380
So it doesn't come up here, such as the series of Vakas passage.

02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:18.740
So it was a response to a worry that you might have.

02:10:18.740 --> 02:10:22.860
Hegel is assuming that by having demonstrated

02:10:22.860 --> 02:10:26.980
that what sensuous certainty can say of its object,

02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:29.340
namely that it's pure being, cannot be

02:10:29.340 --> 02:10:31.620
what it means to be its object.

02:10:31.620 --> 02:10:33.740
But then why couldn't sensuous certainty just

02:10:33.740 --> 02:10:36.060
say, this is a question that as far as I know,

02:10:36.060 --> 02:10:38.380
Hegel doesn't address, that, oh, no, no.

02:10:39.260 --> 02:10:41.620
That's both what I said and what I meant to be my object.

02:10:41.620 --> 02:10:43.500
The object of sensuous certainty is pure being.

02:10:46.340 --> 02:10:47.620
And he doesn't address this.

02:10:47.620 --> 02:10:51.300
Now then you might say, well, OK, how could sensibility,

02:10:51.300 --> 02:10:54.740
how could the senses acquaint you with pure being?

02:10:54.740 --> 02:10:56.940
But now I will talk about series in Vakas.

02:10:56.940 --> 02:10:58.420
So this is a great passage.

02:10:58.420 --> 02:11:00.260
With its appeal to universal experience,

02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:02.620
we may be participating to anticipate concerns

02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:04.020
in the practical sense.

02:11:04.020 --> 02:11:06.340
So the phenomenology is not just about theoretical knowledge,

02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:08.860
it's also about practical knowledge, knowledgeable is good.

02:11:08.860 --> 02:11:11.020
In this respect, what one can say

02:11:11.020 --> 02:11:13.260
to those who make assertions about the truth and reality

02:11:13.260 --> 02:11:16.380
of sensuous objects is that they should be sent back

02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:18.900
to the most elementary school of wisdom,

02:11:18.900 --> 02:11:23.780
namely to the old Ellucidian secrets of Ceres and Vakas.

02:11:23.780 --> 02:11:27.260
So the Ellucidian mysteries are this mystery cult

02:11:27.260 --> 02:11:31.300
in ancient Greece that you would be inducted into,

02:11:31.300 --> 02:11:34.620
and you would be taught various cosmic truths

02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:37.100
about the universe that we don't know that much about it.

02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:42.300
But Hegel knows as much as anyone in the 19th century

02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:46.820
other than Schelling about classical antiquity.

02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:52.180
And he has a view about what the esoteric doctrine, the insider

02:11:52.180 --> 02:11:54.460
teaching of the Ellucidian mystery cult was.

02:11:54.460 --> 02:11:55.960
And he's about to tell us what is.

02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:58.820
And they have yet to learn the secret of the eating of the bread

02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:01.100
and drinking of the wine.

02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:04.340
This is so because the person who has been initiated into these secrets

02:12:04.380 --> 02:12:07.500
not only comes to doubt the being of sensuous things,

02:12:07.500 --> 02:12:10.540
but rather it arrives at despair about them.

02:12:10.540 --> 02:12:13.020
In part, he brings about their nothingness.

02:12:13.020 --> 02:12:17.660
And in part, he seems them to seize them to do it to themselves.

02:12:17.660 --> 02:12:22.620
So what Hegel is referencing is the fact that on his view,

02:12:22.620 --> 02:12:25.820
what you learned in the Ellucidian mysteries

02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:31.020
was that no individual being has any reality.

02:12:31.020 --> 02:12:34.740
And you learned this by basically taking a lot of drugs.

02:12:34.740 --> 02:12:36.020
I'm totally serious.

02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:37.420
This is almost certainly true.

02:12:37.420 --> 02:12:39.260
Almost certainly true of all these ancient mystery

02:12:39.260 --> 02:12:42.340
cults were based on the heavy use of all this magic.

02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:45.460
That's like you can actually prove this archaeologically

02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:48.140
because you can get plant residue from these various bowls

02:12:48.140 --> 02:12:51.060
and you can figure out what psychedelics they use.

02:12:51.060 --> 02:12:53.420
You take a bunch of psychedelics, and then they would perform

02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:54.940
these little pageants for you.

02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:57.420
And then the point on Hegel's interpretation,

02:12:57.420 --> 02:12:59.580
the point of the pageant was to discover

02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:02.820
that no finite being has any reality.

02:13:02.820 --> 02:13:06.460
The only being that's real is pure being.

02:13:06.460 --> 02:13:10.020
So the point is the people who insist

02:13:10.020 --> 02:13:13.660
on the reality of individual things, the sensuous certainty

02:13:13.660 --> 02:13:18.860
person, needs to go do the Ellucidian mysteries.

02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:21.940
And what they'll see is that's the true result of their view,

02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:25.300
that the only thing that's real is pure being.

02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:27.300
Now what are the animals excluded from this wisdom?

02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:28.780
Instead, they prove themselves to be

02:13:28.780 --> 02:13:30.620
the most deeply initiated into it,

02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:33.180
for they do not stand still in the face of sensuous things

02:13:33.180 --> 02:13:35.220
as if those things existed in themselves.

02:13:35.220 --> 02:13:36.980
Despairing of the reality of those things

02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:39.420
and in the total certainty of the nullity of those things,

02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:41.180
they without any further ado simply

02:13:41.180 --> 02:13:43.380
help themselves to them and devour them.

02:13:43.380 --> 02:13:45.020
Just like the animals, all of nature

02:13:45.020 --> 02:13:46.780
celebrates these revealed mysteries,

02:13:46.780 --> 02:13:51.260
which teach the truth about sensuous things.

02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:53.700
So Hegel is saying, even the animals know better

02:13:53.700 --> 02:13:55.580
than the sensuous certainty person,

02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:57.780
they know that finite things don't have any reality

02:13:57.780 --> 02:13:59.900
because you can just eat them.

02:13:59.900 --> 02:14:01.660
So is that just a joke?

02:14:01.660 --> 02:14:03.020
It's not just a joke.

02:14:03.020 --> 02:14:06.340
Because Hegel's view, Hegel's true view,

02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:08.860
he's not someone who believes that the only thing that's

02:14:08.860 --> 02:14:10.220
real is pure being.

02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:14.060
That view is called a cosmose.

02:14:14.060 --> 02:14:20.620
It's the view that denies the existence of the cosmos,

02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:24.500
where we take the cosmos to mean determinate beings,

02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:28.260
determinate or find ideas.

02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:32.140
So if an atheist is someone who denies the existence of God,

02:14:32.140 --> 02:14:35.820
and a cosmist is someone who denies the existence of beings,

02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:37.620
there's only pure being.

02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:41.460
Now Hegel, I'm sort of obsessed with this.

02:14:41.460 --> 02:14:43.380
Some of you heard me talk about this many, many times.

02:14:43.380 --> 02:14:44.900
This is one of my great hobby horses.

02:14:44.900 --> 02:14:49.060
Hegel is obsessed with refuting a cosmose.

02:14:49.060 --> 02:14:56.900
In fact, the science of logic, in a less temperate moment,

02:14:56.900 --> 02:14:58.940
I would say Hegel's entire philosophical project

02:14:58.940 --> 02:15:00.660
consists in the reputation of a cosmose.

02:15:00.660 --> 02:15:02.340
That's a little bit of an exaggeration.

02:15:02.340 --> 02:15:05.300
But his view about the North, so Hegel

02:15:05.300 --> 02:15:08.540
does not think that the Eleusinian mysteries are

02:15:08.540 --> 02:15:09.540
getting you at the truth.

02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:11.500
Namely, all there is is pure being and finite things

02:15:11.500 --> 02:15:12.860
have no reality.

02:15:12.860 --> 02:15:15.260
He thinks that view is incoherent.

02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:17.260
Because if they have no finite reality,

02:15:17.260 --> 02:15:21.060
how could you have thought they had a finite reality?

02:15:21.060 --> 02:15:23.700
The illusory being is a kind of being.

02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:27.660
So they can't not exist at all.

02:15:27.660 --> 02:15:31.820
And furthermore, he thinks that the pressure to a cosmism

02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:33.980
is endemic or internal, more or less,

02:15:33.980 --> 02:15:35.820
to the entire Western philosophical tradition.

02:15:35.820 --> 02:15:37.900
In fact, Western philosophy begins with a cosmism.

02:15:37.900 --> 02:15:40.980
It begins with Parnedians.

02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:44.900
And it returns in the form of Spinoza,

02:15:45.540 --> 02:15:47.780
he thinks Spinoza, although he Spinoza denies it,

02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:51.460
Spinoza's view entails that no finite things exist.

02:15:51.460 --> 02:15:54.060
In fact, not just no finite things, no beings exist.

02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:55.100
God is not a being.

02:15:55.100 --> 02:15:56.260
God is just pure being.

02:15:56.260 --> 02:15:57.700
That's what Hegel thinks Western is.

02:15:57.700 --> 02:16:00.580
He's also read it.

02:16:00.580 --> 02:16:03.460
And he thinks that his entire philosophical tradition,

02:16:03.460 --> 02:16:06.060
fifth de Chale, all of his pals, also

02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:10.820
have this problem that their fundamental first principle,

02:16:10.820 --> 02:16:14.180
the I or the indifference point, actually

02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:17.180
eliminates the existence of all finite things.

02:16:17.180 --> 02:16:18.540
It eliminates all beings.

02:16:18.540 --> 02:16:20.580
It's just pure being.

02:16:20.580 --> 02:16:22.860
So what we have to do is maintain

02:16:22.860 --> 02:16:25.660
the existence of finite things, but not in this dumb way

02:16:25.660 --> 02:16:27.740
that sexual certainty wants to.

02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:29.980
Here's a being, here's another being,

02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:32.940
and they're unrelated to one another.

02:16:32.940 --> 02:16:34.980
In fact, the way we have to retain

02:16:34.980 --> 02:16:38.300
the being of finite things is the way the animals do,

02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:41.620
which is to say, they have a, finite things

02:16:41.620 --> 02:16:47.820
have a kind of being, which is then subrelated,

02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:50.500
but then retained at a higher level.

02:16:50.500 --> 02:16:53.020
So we'll talk about this in the logic,

02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:57.340
but the digestive model of the animal's relationship

02:16:57.340 --> 02:16:59.580
to finite things is, in fact, Hegel's

02:16:59.580 --> 02:17:01.500
view about the reality of finite things.

02:17:01.500 --> 02:17:03.500
So what he's saying is, you need to go

02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:05.420
to the L.O. studio of mysteries, or more properly,

02:17:05.420 --> 02:17:07.060
just to pay attention to animals.

02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:11.060
And what you'll see is, finite things do have a kind of being.

02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:12.780
Then we'll read some more.

02:17:12.780 --> 02:17:14.940
Actually, in the back, we have not heard from you.

02:17:14.940 --> 02:17:16.540
Yeah, sorry.

02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:20.860
So then, where does, I guess, Hegel's one time student,

02:17:20.860 --> 02:17:22.420
Sterner fall out?

02:17:22.420 --> 02:17:23.860
I have no idea.

02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:26.660
I've never read any Sterner, because it just

02:17:26.660 --> 02:17:29.460
sounds so insane.

02:17:29.460 --> 02:17:32.220
Generally, so after Hegel's death,

02:17:32.220 --> 02:17:36.420
or even during Hegel's life, people

02:17:36.420 --> 02:17:38.980
divide in their reactions to Hegel

02:17:38.980 --> 02:17:41.700
between so-called left Hegelians, who

02:17:41.700 --> 02:17:44.660
think that the true philosophical message of Hegel

02:17:44.660 --> 02:17:48.260
is revolutionary with respect to traditional religion

02:17:48.260 --> 02:17:49.780
in the Prussian state.

02:17:49.780 --> 02:17:53.780
Right Hegelians, who think Hegel is a defender

02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:56.940
of orthodox Lutheranism, and the Prussian monarchy,

02:17:56.940 --> 02:17:58.660
and the true view.

02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:03.100
Central Hegelianism, Hegel was a central Hegelian, namely

02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:08.340
that the true religious concept of Hegel

02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:12.700
is not very much like orthodox Lutheranism,

02:18:12.700 --> 02:18:15.460
but nor is it any kind of atheism,

02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:17.140
or this Freudian nonsense about how

02:18:17.140 --> 02:18:19.380
God is the projection of our inferiority complex,

02:18:19.380 --> 02:18:21.820
or whatever.

02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:24.460
And the political content of Hegelian philosophy

02:18:24.460 --> 02:18:26.980
is a constitutional reform of the Prussian monarchy,

02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:29.900
rather than it's in its absolutist form.

02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:32.180
But I have not gotten into this.

02:18:32.180 --> 02:18:34.220
Sterner is one of the big left Hegelians,

02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:36.220
but I have, to a large extent, not really gotten

02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:37.300
to the left Hegelianism, because they

02:18:37.340 --> 02:18:40.140
don't feel like I understand Hegel well enough to get

02:18:40.140 --> 02:18:42.380
into the left, right, and center Hegelianism.

02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:45.180
OK, but before we finish today, I

02:18:45.180 --> 02:18:49.860
want to talk about the end of 110, or actually 110.

02:18:49.860 --> 02:18:52.900
However, those who set up such assertions in lines

02:18:52.900 --> 02:18:54.980
with the previous remarks also immediately

02:18:54.980 --> 02:18:56.860
say the opposite of what they mean,

02:18:56.860 --> 02:18:58.660
a phenomenon that is perhaps best

02:18:58.660 --> 02:19:00.340
able to bring them to reflect on the nature

02:19:00.340 --> 02:19:01.740
of the century with certainty.

02:19:01.740 --> 02:19:03.980
They speak of the existence of external objects,

02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:05.660
which, to put it more precisely, can

02:19:05.660 --> 02:19:07.860
be turned into the actual, absolutely singular,

02:19:07.860 --> 02:19:11.140
individual, wholly personal, individual things, each of which

02:19:11.140 --> 02:19:13.020
is absolutely unlike the others.

02:19:13.020 --> 02:19:16.140
This existence is said to have absolute certainty and truth.

02:19:16.140 --> 02:19:18.820
They mean this piece of paper on which I am writing,

02:19:18.820 --> 02:19:20.620
or rather have written this.

02:19:20.620 --> 02:19:22.900
But they do not say what they mean.

02:19:22.900 --> 02:19:26.540
They intend to talk about concrete, sensible particulars,

02:19:26.540 --> 02:19:28.740
but what they really say is universals.

02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:31.020
However much they actually wanted to say what they

02:19:31.020 --> 02:19:33.540
knew about this piece of paper, and however much they wanted

02:19:33.540 --> 02:19:35.940
to say it, still it would be impossible

02:19:35.940 --> 02:19:39.260
because the sensuous this, which is what is meant,

02:19:39.260 --> 02:19:43.100
is inaccessible to the language which belongs to consciousness,

02:19:43.100 --> 02:19:45.540
or to what is in itself universal.

02:19:45.540 --> 02:19:48.420
In the actual attempt to say it, in itself

02:19:48.420 --> 02:19:50.500
would therefore rot away.

02:19:50.500 --> 02:19:55.540
So the singular, an individual, is inaccessible to the language

02:19:55.540 --> 02:20:00.620
of consciousness because, to refer to this,

02:20:00.620 --> 02:20:04.500
you need not just a universal, nor do you

02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:07.660
need just a singular indexical like this.

02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:09.420
You need both.

02:20:09.420 --> 02:20:12.420
You need to refer to this pencil.

02:20:12.420 --> 02:20:15.380
You need to have a conception of the object

02:20:15.380 --> 02:20:19.020
as an instance of a universal.

02:20:19.020 --> 02:20:22.020
So the idea is, if you just have this,

02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:25.180
there's no account of why you're referring to the pencil

02:20:25.180 --> 02:20:28.820
rather than the parts of the pencil, the eraser, the tip.

02:20:28.820 --> 02:20:33.020
The only way objects can be available for consciousness

02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:38.380
is if they are this such, an instance of a universal.

02:20:38.380 --> 02:20:42.340
Skipping a bit, if nothing is more said of a thing,

02:20:42.340 --> 02:20:45.820
that it is an actual thing, an external object,

02:20:45.820 --> 02:20:49.500
that it is only expressed as the most universal of all.

02:20:49.500 --> 02:20:53.620
And what is therefore expressed is the sameness with everything

02:20:53.620 --> 02:20:55.700
rather than its distinctiveness.

02:20:55.700 --> 02:20:58.700
If I say a singular thing, then instead I

02:20:58.700 --> 02:21:01.260
say something entirely universal about it,

02:21:01.260 --> 02:21:03.540
for everything is a singular thing.

02:21:03.540 --> 02:21:06.700
Likewise, this thing is anything one pleases.

02:21:06.700 --> 02:21:10.460
To characterize it more precisely as this piece of paper,

02:21:10.460 --> 02:21:13.980
every and each bit of paper is a this, a piece of paper,

02:21:13.980 --> 02:21:18.220
and I've only spoken, as usual, of the universal.

02:21:18.220 --> 02:21:20.720
That is to say, I need not just a universal, but something

02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:22.500
like a Kantian intuition.

02:21:22.500 --> 02:21:25.100
However, if I wish to lend a helping hand to speech,

02:21:25.100 --> 02:21:27.780
which itself has the defined nature of immediately inverting

02:21:27.780 --> 02:21:30.540
the meaning, that of making it to something else,

02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:32.700
and in that way of not letting the meaning get

02:21:32.700 --> 02:21:34.220
into words at all.

02:21:34.220 --> 02:21:37.020
So this is what Hegel loves these plays on language,

02:21:37.020 --> 02:21:39.420
because he thinks what language shows

02:21:39.420 --> 02:21:42.620
is this distinction between what consciousness means to say

02:21:42.620 --> 02:21:45.140
and what it says.

02:21:45.140 --> 02:21:47.140
Then by pointing out this piece of paper,

02:21:47.140 --> 02:21:49.660
I thus learn from experience what the truth of sensuous

02:21:49.660 --> 02:21:51.340
certainty, in fact, is.

02:21:51.340 --> 02:21:53.500
I point it out as a hearer, which

02:21:53.500 --> 02:21:56.460
is a hearer of other hearers, for which in its own self

02:21:56.460 --> 02:21:59.700
is a simple ensemble of many hearers, which is to say,

02:21:59.700 --> 02:22:01.140
is a universal.

02:22:01.140 --> 02:22:04.060
In that way, I receive it as it is in truth,

02:22:04.060 --> 02:22:07.300
and instead of noting what is immediate, I perceive.

02:22:07.300 --> 02:22:09.740
So now what Hegel is doing is transitioning

02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:13.820
to the transition from the first object to the second.

02:22:13.820 --> 02:22:16.260
So that is to say, from the first form of consciousness

02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:18.340
to the second form of consciousness.

02:22:18.340 --> 02:22:21.100
The second form of consciousness is the determinant negation

02:22:21.180 --> 02:22:24.020
of the first form of consciousness.

02:22:24.020 --> 02:22:25.300
We don't have a new beginning.

02:22:25.300 --> 02:22:26.580
We don't start from nothing.

02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:28.500
Nor is the second shape of consciousness just,

02:22:28.500 --> 02:22:30.220
you don't know it.

02:22:30.220 --> 02:22:33.780
The second object is the being of the first object

02:22:33.780 --> 02:22:35.180
for consciousness.

02:22:35.180 --> 02:22:38.460
So insofar as the first object knew something,

02:22:38.460 --> 02:22:40.820
the second object is what it knew.

02:22:40.820 --> 02:22:45.460
So insofar as the first shape of consciousness knew something

02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:49.820
or intended to know something, it was this.

02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:52.500
But the reason it couldn't know this

02:22:52.500 --> 02:22:56.020
is because it didn't put any universals in the shape,

02:22:56.020 --> 02:22:58.700
in the object of its knowledge.

02:22:58.700 --> 02:23:02.700
So the resolution of that problem

02:23:02.700 --> 02:23:06.340
is to recognize that the object of knowledge

02:23:06.340 --> 02:23:10.100
is a thing that instantiates universals,

02:23:10.100 --> 02:23:13.940
a thing with properties, of this such.

02:23:13.940 --> 02:23:17.900
Because once we have that, we have both of this,

02:23:17.900 --> 02:23:21.380
which is something like a spatio-temporal indexical.

02:23:21.380 --> 02:23:24.180
It indicates a direction in your environment.

02:23:24.180 --> 02:23:26.940
But then with the concept, it picks out

02:23:26.940 --> 02:23:29.940
in the fortunate case which thing in your environment

02:23:29.940 --> 02:23:31.460
you're referring to.

02:23:31.460 --> 02:23:37.300
If I say, this book, I'm screwed.

02:23:37.300 --> 02:23:40.740
If I say, this iPhone, now I'm good to go.

02:23:40.740 --> 02:23:42.780
And the reason that worked is because I

02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:45.100
didn't say the iPhone or iPhones.

02:23:45.100 --> 02:23:47.380
That will refer to all iPhones whatsoever.

02:23:47.460 --> 02:23:50.620
Nor did I say this, because this doesn't determinately

02:23:50.620 --> 02:23:51.780
refer to anything.

02:23:51.780 --> 02:23:53.380
I said, this iPhone.

02:23:53.380 --> 02:23:57.460
And that only picks out this if this is an iPhone,

02:23:57.460 --> 02:23:59.380
and not everything else is an iPhone, which

02:23:59.380 --> 02:24:01.700
means this has to have a universal,

02:24:01.700 --> 02:24:03.340
has to be an instance of something,

02:24:03.340 --> 02:24:06.860
and it has to be a universal that other things don't have,

02:24:06.860 --> 02:24:08.940
not everything else has.

02:24:08.940 --> 02:24:11.260
Otherwise, it wouldn't pick it up.

02:24:11.260 --> 02:24:12.260
Yeah?

02:24:12.460 --> 02:24:16.900
For instance, expressing it as an actual thing

02:24:16.900 --> 02:24:20.900
and its sameness with everything else,

02:24:20.900 --> 02:24:22.900
does this, when you speak to the students,

02:24:22.900 --> 02:24:24.660
be that Schelling position that you

02:24:24.660 --> 02:24:26.900
emphasize in the practice of managing the 12,000

02:24:26.900 --> 02:24:29.700
by a computer-socially-centered student?

02:24:29.700 --> 02:24:30.300
Yes.

02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:34.060
In an other way, if we want to bring Schelling into that,

02:24:34.060 --> 02:24:43.740
what he's saying is what sensuous certainty means

02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:46.300
to know, what it intends to know,

02:24:46.300 --> 02:24:48.260
is concrete particulars.

02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:50.620
What it actually says it knows is

02:24:50.620 --> 02:24:53.860
something as indeterminate as Schelling's note in which

02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:55.980
all cows are alive.

02:24:55.980 --> 02:24:57.460
Pure be.

02:24:57.460 --> 02:25:05.060
Now, that brings in Schelling, but many of you

02:25:05.060 --> 02:25:06.420
don't know who Schelling is.

02:25:06.420 --> 02:25:07.380
Don't worry about it.

02:25:07.380 --> 02:25:13.540
But the first principle of Schelling's philosophy,

02:25:13.540 --> 02:25:16.780
Hegel thinks is, actually Schelling explicitly says this,

02:25:16.780 --> 02:25:20.460
is as indeterminate as purity.

02:25:20.460 --> 02:25:22.900
That's to say, it has no differences or determinacies

02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:24.100
in it whatsoever.

02:25:24.100 --> 02:25:26.980
It's completely a cosmos starting point.

02:25:27.020 --> 02:25:32.420
So what Hegel is saying is that sensuous certainty thinks

02:25:32.420 --> 02:25:34.740
it's the most concrete empiricist position

02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:35.620
possible.

02:25:35.620 --> 02:25:38.900
But what it's actually saying is that what it's conscious of

02:25:38.900 --> 02:25:41.820
is the most insane Schellingian totally

02:25:41.820 --> 02:25:46.460
indifferent starting point of all philosophy.

02:25:46.460 --> 02:25:50.060
So that means that the second shape of consciousness

02:25:50.060 --> 02:25:56.280
is one in which objects are instances of universals, things

02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:58.520
with problems.

02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:01.040
Now, I just want to note that if we

02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:06.320
look at the table of contents of the phenomenology of spirit,

02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:09.720
I think this edition has a relatively informative one.

02:26:12.720 --> 02:26:17.000
We'll just note that the first form of consciousness

02:26:17.000 --> 02:26:18.800
is sensuous certainty.

02:26:18.800 --> 02:26:21.960
The second shape of consciousness is perceiving.

02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:23.880
And the third shape of consciousness

02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:26.880
is force and the understanding, appearance,

02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:29.000
and the super sensible world.

02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.920
So if we think of this in Kantian terms,

02:26:31.920 --> 02:26:33.760
and then the second one is self-consciousness,

02:26:33.760 --> 02:26:37.320
we're in a certain way building up

02:26:37.320 --> 02:26:39.440
the capacities of the Kantian mind.

02:26:39.440 --> 02:26:44.360
There's appearance, perception, and then understanding.

02:26:44.360 --> 02:26:46.680
Where understanding involves making a distinction

02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:52.920
between how things appear to you and the super sensible objects

02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:54.440
that are appearing to you.

02:26:54.440 --> 02:26:58.320
And then there's aperceptive self-consciousness.

02:26:58.320 --> 02:27:00.400
Now, that doesn't mean that this is supposed

02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:04.160
to correspond one-to-one with Kant's taxonomy

02:27:04.160 --> 02:27:09.200
of the human mind because Hegel thinks of Kant

02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:10.880
as he thinks of every other philosopher

02:27:10.880 --> 02:27:12.920
as insufficiently systematic.

02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:15.880
That's to say, we don't want a one-to-one correspondence

02:27:15.880 --> 02:27:18.640
with Kant's quote unquote system because Kant's system isn't

02:27:18.640 --> 02:27:20.280
really systematic.

02:27:20.360 --> 02:27:23.480
This is the systematic articulation

02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:26.000
of everything that has to be in spirit in order

02:27:26.000 --> 02:27:28.320
for spirit to be spirit.

02:27:28.320 --> 02:27:31.360
But even properly, it maybe isn't that

02:27:31.360 --> 02:27:34.800
because it's doing that by way of uncovering

02:27:34.800 --> 02:27:37.480
the internal dialectical failures of all

02:27:37.480 --> 02:27:42.400
of these other conceptions of what now it is.

02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:42.880
Yeah.

02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:44.000
Yeah.

02:27:44.000 --> 02:27:47.080
I have a question similar to Kantian's one.

02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:48.760
And it's just about concepts.

02:27:48.840 --> 02:27:52.240
I feel like in the Cartesian sense,

02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:54.560
the thoughts in itself themselves

02:27:54.560 --> 02:27:57.360
are kind of immediate to us.

02:27:57.360 --> 02:28:01.840
And then with perceptual input, we see new things.

02:28:01.840 --> 02:28:05.560
And we maybe we can modify all those concepts and so on.

02:28:05.560 --> 02:28:07.520
It's like backwards.

02:28:07.520 --> 02:28:12.960
So that is a remark in a different way

02:28:12.960 --> 02:28:16.720
of doing philosophy, a way of doing philosophy in which we

02:28:16.720 --> 02:28:20.120
start with what seems plausible to us,

02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:22.520
and then we reason from there.

02:28:22.520 --> 02:28:24.000
That's not what Hegel is doing.

02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:26.320
That's not how the phenomenology works.

02:28:26.320 --> 02:28:30.160
The phenomenology does not work with any.

02:28:30.160 --> 02:28:33.480
Our assumptions are supposed to be completely suspended.

02:28:33.480 --> 02:28:36.760
And it's supposed to unfold from the most immediate,

02:28:36.760 --> 02:28:40.120
that is to say, indeterminate shape of knowledge possible,

02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:42.080
everything that knowledge is.

02:28:42.080 --> 02:28:45.040
So what seems to us plausible isn't,

02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:47.520
so to speak, argumentatively relevant.

02:28:47.520 --> 02:28:54.160
And so likewise, what's phenomenologically available

02:28:54.160 --> 02:28:58.000
to us in Dufcerlian sense also isn't relevant,

02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:04.600
because that would assume a different conception

02:29:04.600 --> 02:29:06.520
of what knowledge is, which hasn't been dialectically

02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:09.440
unfolded yet in phenomenology.

02:29:09.440 --> 02:29:10.720
Yeah.

02:29:10.720 --> 02:29:12.600
In the previous lecture, you said

02:29:12.600 --> 02:29:15.040
that each shape of consciousness

02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:19.200
has to determine the next shape of consciousness.

02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:22.080
It seems like pure consciousness has options

02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:25.840
between sticking to its original claim.

02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:27.720
I know particulars.

02:29:27.720 --> 02:29:30.880
Or just going into pure being.

02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:32.840
How about an issue?

02:29:32.840 --> 02:29:34.200
It is an issue.

02:29:34.200 --> 02:29:36.400
The systematic structure of phenomenology

02:29:36.400 --> 02:29:40.520
requires that there be one and only one successor

02:29:40.520 --> 02:29:41.800
shape of consciousness.

02:29:41.800 --> 02:29:45.800
If there's forking paths, then the argument is real.

02:29:45.800 --> 02:29:50.360
So if we really want to take phenomenology seriously,

02:29:50.360 --> 02:29:52.400
we have to ask ourselves at every step,

02:29:52.400 --> 02:29:55.040
is there a potential forking path here?

02:29:55.040 --> 02:29:59.720
And the move towards pure being is one such forking path.

02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:02.640
Now, I think Hegel thinks he has a number of reasons

02:30:02.640 --> 02:30:06.760
to foreclose sensuous certainty of pure being

02:30:06.760 --> 02:30:09.480
as a possibility, one of which will be relevant when we talk

02:30:09.480 --> 02:30:11.240
about pure being and logic, is I think

02:30:11.240 --> 02:30:15.680
he thinks pure being is not a possible object of knowledge

02:30:15.680 --> 02:30:17.440
because it's so indeterminate.

02:30:17.440 --> 02:30:20.000
You can't know pure being.

02:30:20.000 --> 02:30:22.120
What would you know?

02:30:22.120 --> 02:30:24.680
What did you learn at school today, pure being?

02:30:24.680 --> 02:30:25.680
Oh, tell me about that.

02:30:25.680 --> 02:30:27.880
It is.

02:30:27.880 --> 02:30:30.480
It is just purely.

02:30:30.480 --> 02:30:31.840
Is there any particular way?

02:30:31.840 --> 02:30:32.560
Oh, no, no, no.

02:30:32.560 --> 02:30:33.680
It's not any particular way.

02:30:33.680 --> 02:30:34.160
It just did.

02:30:37.520 --> 02:30:38.400
Yes, fine.

02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:40.120
Each of the arguments Hegel makes,

02:30:40.440 --> 02:30:42.520
are those supposedly the only arguments that

02:30:42.520 --> 02:30:44.920
can be made to move from one argument to the next?

02:30:47.840 --> 02:30:48.920
Good question.

02:30:48.920 --> 02:30:51.240
I don't think Hegel wants to like,

02:30:51.240 --> 02:30:54.080
we don't want to read Hegel as having some like,

02:30:54.080 --> 02:30:57.960
implausible view or like, these words in exactly this order

02:30:57.960 --> 02:30:59.080
have to be written this way.

02:30:59.080 --> 02:31:03.400
So like, there has to be some flexibility or plasticity

02:31:03.400 --> 02:31:05.280
in the order of presentation.

02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:08.240
Like, did he have to do this whole thing of doing,

02:31:09.200 --> 02:31:12.800
now is night, and here's the tree, here's the house.

02:31:12.800 --> 02:31:14.160
I see the tree.

02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:16.160
I see the house as someone else.

02:31:16.160 --> 02:31:17.880
Couldn't he have just skipped immediately

02:31:17.880 --> 02:31:20.160
to the form of sensuous certainty

02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:22.840
in which there's no essential difference,

02:31:22.840 --> 02:31:25.120
no difference in essence between subject and object?

02:31:25.120 --> 02:31:26.680
Probably.

02:31:26.680 --> 02:31:31.240
But the problems arise from the shape of consciousness itself,

02:31:31.240 --> 02:31:35.040
and therefore, they cannot be Hegel's invention.

02:31:35.040 --> 02:31:37.320
So I'll just warn, I mean, one of the reasons

02:31:37.320 --> 02:31:39.120
I don't love teaching the phenomenology of spirit

02:31:39.120 --> 02:31:40.120
as the whole book, I actually love

02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:43.280
teaching sensuous certainty because people get the point.

02:31:43.280 --> 02:31:47.200
And you can actually kind of philosophically engage with it,

02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:48.440
pretty straightforwardly.

02:31:48.440 --> 02:31:51.160
One of the reasons I don't love teaching the whole book is,

02:31:51.160 --> 02:31:54.560
the further you go in the book, the harder it is to believe

02:31:54.560 --> 02:31:56.840
all of the transitions are principled.

02:31:56.840 --> 02:32:00.600
So famously, as a friend of mine, I put it this way,

02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:02.880
it's more or less impossible to predict

02:32:02.880 --> 02:32:05.200
what the next shape of consciousness is going to be,

02:32:05.240 --> 02:32:07.800
which is a sign that there is not, in fact,

02:32:07.800 --> 02:32:10.640
a principal function that takes you from shape of consciousness

02:32:10.640 --> 02:32:13.280
n to n plus 1, because then we would just learn the function.

02:32:13.280 --> 02:32:14.800
Every time I read the phenomenology,

02:32:14.800 --> 02:32:16.840
I'm a little surprised by what comes next.

02:32:16.840 --> 02:32:18.120
I'm like, really?

02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:19.400
Why that?

02:32:19.400 --> 02:32:24.240
Likewise, it's hard by the end of the book

02:32:24.240 --> 02:32:30.800
to feel like all of these problems are purely interned.

02:32:30.800 --> 02:32:32.560
My general sense is, I kind of feel

02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:35.400
like I have a line on what's going on everything up

02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:36.440
through reason.

02:32:36.440 --> 02:32:38.520
And then the transition, once we transition

02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:40.800
to spirit in the middle of the book,

02:32:40.800 --> 02:32:44.120
the feeling of arbitrariness in the successor

02:32:44.120 --> 02:32:47.480
shapes of consciousness and the problems that arise

02:32:47.480 --> 02:32:50.920
starts to just kind of grow exponentially.

02:32:50.920 --> 02:32:54.840
So after we get to reason, we get to spirit.

02:32:54.840 --> 02:32:58.000
And the first shape of spirit is this shape of spirit

02:32:58.000 --> 02:33:07.160
in which somehow your family is in touch

02:33:07.160 --> 02:33:11.440
with the gods of the underworld.

02:33:11.440 --> 02:33:13.520
But then in your public life, you're

02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:18.360
like a good patriotic Greek citizen.

02:33:18.360 --> 02:33:21.440
So it's just like, what?

02:33:21.440 --> 02:33:23.240
Why are we talking about antigone?

02:33:23.240 --> 02:33:26.680
It's just very hard for me to really be convinced

02:33:26.680 --> 02:33:28.840
about every transition.

02:33:28.840 --> 02:33:31.680
I'm not a super phenomenology optimist.

02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:33.800
Just to make sure I got this, however,

02:33:33.800 --> 02:33:38.280
the paradox of sense certainty is not

02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:41.440
being able to say what it means or the contradiction to what

02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:44.920
it means when it says, are the rocks on which sense certainty

02:33:44.920 --> 02:33:50.080
as a shape of knowing, for example.

02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:53.280
And that's what causes the despair, is it,

02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:56.040
that lifts us up to the next?

02:33:56.040 --> 02:33:56.540
Exactly.

02:33:56.540 --> 02:33:58.280
Up to the next state.

02:33:58.280 --> 02:34:04.320
And that's an example of an internal self-contradiction.

02:34:04.320 --> 02:34:06.800
Or imminent, yeah.

02:34:06.800 --> 02:34:11.800
Could not the advocate of sense certainty

02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:17.480
say that contradiction is not part of its bag

02:34:17.480 --> 02:34:20.040
and that therefore what's being advanced against it

02:34:20.040 --> 02:34:21.800
is actually an external criteria?

02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:22.680
Good.

02:34:22.680 --> 02:34:25.440
Gets to a fundamental issue in Hegel's philosophy.

02:34:25.520 --> 02:34:29.160
Why do we have to care about contradictions?

02:34:29.160 --> 02:34:33.720
Foundational, if we just read the way the book works,

02:34:33.720 --> 02:34:40.280
it seems absolutely foundational that contradictions are death.

02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:42.400
That means you get a contradiction,

02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:44.000
you have to overcome it.

02:34:44.000 --> 02:34:48.840
Sense to a certainty cannot just rest content.

02:34:48.840 --> 02:34:51.440
Just be like, yep, I know this object.

02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:53.280
That object is not knowable.

02:34:53.280 --> 02:34:55.040
What's the problem?

02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:00.560
Now, this will be more relevant in the science of logic.

02:35:00.560 --> 02:35:03.920
But Hegel's, both the phenomenology and the science

02:35:03.920 --> 02:35:06.640
of logic, mostly explicitly, I kind of think actually

02:35:06.640 --> 02:35:08.440
the entire encyclopedia, the entire system,

02:35:08.440 --> 02:35:13.040
depends on uncovering and reconciling contradictions.

02:35:13.040 --> 02:35:15.840
Now, that's true, as you just brought out,

02:35:15.840 --> 02:35:18.520
from the word one of the phenomenology.

02:35:18.520 --> 02:35:22.440
It will also be true from word one of the science of logic.

02:35:22.440 --> 02:35:25.760
Now, no justification is given to us.

02:35:25.760 --> 02:35:28.960
So that means it's internal, it's foundational for Hegel,

02:35:28.960 --> 02:35:31.600
that you cannot just rest content with a contradiction.

02:35:31.600 --> 02:35:34.120
You have to move beyond.

02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:38.520
Now, that means that a certain kind of attitude

02:35:38.520 --> 02:35:40.680
towards the principle of contradiction

02:35:40.680 --> 02:35:44.600
is built into the way the whole philosophical system works.

02:35:44.600 --> 02:35:47.400
One view about contradictions is that contradictions cannot even

02:35:47.400 --> 02:35:49.720
be thought.

02:35:49.720 --> 02:35:53.480
You can say P and not P, but you haven't thought anything.

02:35:53.480 --> 02:35:57.320
Kant can be read as saying that.

02:35:57.320 --> 02:36:00.560
Another view is that you just shouldn't

02:36:00.560 --> 02:36:03.000
believe contradictions, you shouldn't think of them.

02:36:03.000 --> 02:36:05.320
You can, but you shouldn't give them.

02:36:05.320 --> 02:36:07.680
Kant can also be read that way.

02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:11.720
The problem with the don't do it is, OK,

02:36:11.720 --> 02:36:14.360
I do a lot of things I shouldn't do.

02:36:14.360 --> 02:36:17.600
What's so bad about contradicting myself?

02:36:17.600 --> 02:36:19.320
What I say won't be true, but I also

02:36:19.320 --> 02:36:22.560
say a lot of things aren't true.

02:36:22.560 --> 02:36:25.840
The problem with that you can't think it is, well,

02:36:25.840 --> 02:36:28.520
it does seem like we think contradictions all the time.

02:36:28.520 --> 02:36:30.400
You can reason with them.

02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:34.520
So now Hegel definitely is not a you cannot think a contradiction

02:36:34.520 --> 02:36:38.560
person, because the logic is just full of contradictions.

02:36:38.560 --> 02:36:40.480
And it's all thinking.

02:36:40.480 --> 02:36:45.080
But nor is he merely a don't do it, because that's too weak.

02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:50.200
And the logic is not built on, oh, you should keep doing this.

02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:53.800
The forward movement of the phenomenology and the logic

02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:55.600
are not a normative one.

02:36:55.600 --> 02:36:59.760
You're a bad person if you don't keep reading.

02:36:59.760 --> 02:37:03.720
So he seems to have a third view, which is contradictions

02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:10.480
are thinkable, but thought as such must strive to resolve.

02:37:10.480 --> 02:37:13.640
It cannot rest content with a contradiction.

02:37:13.640 --> 02:37:17.640
It has to try to go beyond the contradiction.

02:37:17.640 --> 02:37:21.600
And the reason this is relevant is because there

02:37:21.600 --> 02:37:25.480
are people who read, so we'll talk about this when we get

02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:27.600
to the logic, there are people who

02:37:27.600 --> 02:37:29.560
think there are true contradictions.

02:37:29.560 --> 02:37:32.200
They're called dialytheists, because they

02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:39.080
think something can be both true and false.

02:37:39.600 --> 02:37:43.920
That can be true, that p is both true and false.

02:37:43.920 --> 02:37:47.840
And Hegel is one of their main historical supports.

02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:50.600
You can read Hegel as a dialytheist,

02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:54.360
because he says dialytheist friendly things all the time.

02:37:54.360 --> 02:37:58.160
The problem is if Hegel thinks that contradictions are true,

02:37:58.160 --> 02:38:02.160
when we get to contradictions, why do we have to move beyond them?

02:38:02.160 --> 02:38:04.560
The problem with the dialytheist is

02:38:04.560 --> 02:38:08.200
they don't have a sufficient, for Hegel,

02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:10.360
a sufficiently strong justification of why we,

02:38:10.360 --> 02:38:12.560
when we get to a contradiction, we don't just go, oh,

02:38:12.560 --> 02:38:14.800
interesting fact, contradiction.

02:38:14.800 --> 02:38:18.480
What they will say is you want to minimize contradictions,

02:38:18.480 --> 02:38:21.480
because the more contradictions you have,

02:38:21.480 --> 02:38:23.280
the more messed up your logic is.

02:38:23.280 --> 02:38:25.640
So the basic idea of dialytheist logic

02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:28.440
is you can have a non-trivial logic that

02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:29.840
has true contradictions in it.

02:38:29.840 --> 02:38:31.440
You just have various logical methods

02:38:31.440 --> 02:38:33.520
of constraining, localizing the contradictions.

02:38:33.520 --> 02:38:35.600
So there's a contradictory subject matter here,

02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:36.920
but as long as you're sufficiently far away

02:38:37.000 --> 02:38:39.400
from that subject matter, you don't have to contradict yourself.

02:38:39.400 --> 02:38:43.040
But the problem is that involves a basically pragmatic approach

02:38:43.040 --> 02:38:46.080
to logic, which is totally acceptable in contemporary

02:38:46.080 --> 02:38:48.320
philosophy, but it's totally an alphabet of Hegel's whole way

02:38:48.320 --> 02:38:49.440
of doing philosophy.

02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:51.800
What we're trying to do in hand-making philosophy

02:38:51.800 --> 02:38:56.400
is not like, find the best overall plausible view

02:38:56.400 --> 02:38:58.600
compatible with our starting positions.

02:38:58.600 --> 02:38:59.240
No.

02:38:59.240 --> 02:39:01.080
We're trying to totally systematically

02:39:01.080 --> 02:39:04.520
from a completely indeterminate presuppositionless starting

02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:06.520
point unfold all the philosophy.

02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:08.680
So we need a more systematic explanation

02:39:08.680 --> 02:39:11.600
of why, when we get to a contradiction,

02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:13.680
we're not just happy with that.

02:39:13.680 --> 02:39:17.320
And I mean, this is a very huge topic in Hegel.

02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:18.880
It will occupy us at various points

02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:20.120
over the course of the semester.

02:39:20.120 --> 02:39:22.320
I think it's just internal that Hegel's conception

02:39:22.320 --> 02:39:26.480
is that thinking strives to overcome a contradiction,

02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:28.680
and thinking is not in agreement with itself.

02:39:28.680 --> 02:39:33.720
It's not fully thinking, except insofar as it

02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:36.760
overcomes contradiction.

02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:37.640
OK.

02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:43.440
I think that is going to be it for today.

02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:45.320
I'll set some reading notes for next week.

02:39:45.320 --> 02:39:47.320
There's a lot of reading on the syllabus for next week.

02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:49.560
It'll take me two weeks to get through all of it,

02:39:49.560 --> 02:39:54.880
try to read absolute knowing, and then experience gratitude.

02:39:58.280 --> 02:40:00.280
We're not reading the whole phenomenology.

02:40:03.720 --> 02:40:04.220
Yeah.

02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:05.200
We'll go back.

02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:06.200
We'll go back.

02:40:06.200 --> 02:40:08.680
We'll read the whole phenomenology.

02:40:08.680 --> 02:40:09.160
Yeah.

02:40:09.160 --> 02:40:10.140
I think it's good.

02:40:10.140 --> 02:40:10.640
Yeah.

02:40:10.640 --> 02:40:11.140
Yeah.

02:40:11.140 --> 02:40:12.140
I think it's good.

02:40:12.140 --> 02:40:12.640
Yeah.

02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:13.140
It's good.

02:40:13.140 --> 02:40:13.640
Yeah.

02:40:13.640 --> 02:40:14.140
It's good.

02:40:14.140 --> 02:40:14.640
It's good.

02:40:14.640 --> 02:40:15.120
It's good.

02:40:15.120 --> 02:40:15.620
It's good.

02:40:15.620 --> 02:40:16.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:40:16.120 --> 02:40:16.620
Yeah.

02:40:16.620 --> 02:40:17.120
Yeah.

02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:17.620
Yeah.

02:40:17.620 --> 02:40:18.120
Yeah.

02:40:18.120 --> 02:40:18.620
Yes.

02:40:18.620 --> 02:40:19.120
Thank you.

02:40:19.120 --> 02:40:21.120
Thank you for showing questions.

02:40:21.120 --> 02:40:22.120
Oh, OK.

02:40:22.120 --> 02:40:24.120
One, two, three.

02:40:24.120 --> 02:40:24.620
OK.

02:40:24.620 --> 02:40:26.620
Mr. Brown said that it's OK.

02:40:26.620 --> 02:40:27.120
OK.

02:40:27.120 --> 02:40:27.620
Thank you.

02:40:27.620 --> 02:40:28.620
It's not that it's OK.

02:40:28.620 --> 02:40:29.120
It's OK.

02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:29.620
Yeah.

02:40:29.620 --> 02:40:30.120
It's OK.

02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:31.620
Yes.

02:40:31.620 --> 02:40:33.120
It's not really about politics anymore.

02:40:34.020 --> 02:40:36.020
It's about transformation.

02:40:36.020 --> 02:40:36.520
It's about transformation.

02:40:36.520 --> 02:40:37.020
Yeah.

02:40:37.020 --> 02:40:37.520
Yeah.

02:40:37.520 --> 02:40:39.520
We'll just do it on the conference.

02:40:39.520 --> 02:40:40.520
There you go.

02:40:40.520 --> 02:40:42.020
There you go.

02:40:42.020 --> 02:40:42.520
Yeah.

02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:43.020
Good.

02:40:43.020 --> 02:40:43.520
Thank you.

02:40:43.520 --> 02:40:44.040
Thank you.

02:40:44.040 --> 02:40:44.520
Thank you.

02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:46.020
We have your photos of it.

02:40:46.020 --> 02:40:46.520
OK.

02:40:46.520 --> 02:40:47.020
Thank you.

02:40:47.020 --> 02:40:47.520
Thank you.

02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:48.020
Thank you.

02:40:48.020 --> 02:40:48.520
Thank you.

02:40:48.520 --> 02:40:49.020
OK.

02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:50.020
You're out of the park.

02:40:50.020 --> 02:40:52.020
No, we're not in the park.

02:40:52.020 --> 02:40:55.020
Oh, my family's not here.

02:40:55.020 --> 02:40:55.520
Hello.

02:40:55.520 --> 02:40:56.020
Hello.

02:40:56.020 --> 02:40:56.520
Hello.

02:40:56.520 --> 02:40:57.020
Hello.

02:40:57.020 --> 02:40:57.520
Hello.

02:40:57.520 --> 02:40:58.020
Hello.

02:40:58.020 --> 02:41:00.020
Hello.

02:41:00.020 --> 02:41:00.520
Hello.

02:41:00.520 --> 02:41:01.020
Hello.

02:41:01.020 --> 02:41:01.520
Hello.

02:41:01.520 --> 02:41:02.020
Hello.

02:41:02.020 --> 02:41:02.520
Hello.

02:41:02.520 --> 02:41:03.020
Hello.
