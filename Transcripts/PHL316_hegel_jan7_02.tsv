0	2840	to figure out whether you know that.
2840	5760	What criterion of knowledge should we apply?
5760	7720	Well, one thing we could do is apply
7720	9840	your own criteria of knowledge.
9840	14340	Maybe your criteria of knowledge is faith.
14340	16880	Let's say it's specifically Christian faith.
16880	21240	Okay, your knowledge claim meets that criterion.
21240	23040	But that was a little easy.
23040	27040	Anyone's knowledge claim is gonna meet their own criterion,
27040	28560	you would normally think.
28560	31920	So that surely can't be sufficient for knowledge.
31920	33180	Here's another possibility.
33180	36280	I'll apply another criterion, an external criterion.
36280	38760	Knowledge is the deliverance of natural science.
40000	42760	Natural science doesn't say anything about God,
42760	44020	says Richard Dawkins.
44900	46800	So therefore you don't know that God exists.
46800	48680	That was also a little easy.
48680	50880	It seemed totally questionable.
50880	52960	So that's the glum of the criteria.
52960	55720	Hegel's idea is that the first horn of the dilemma
55720	57760	isn't actually so easy.
57760	61800	Because in fact, these criteria,
61800	63440	these conceptions of knowledge
63440	65600	that natural consciousness generates
65600	70180	are typically incoherence of their object.
70180	72840	Now, you might ask, so one question you might have is,
72840	75760	well, okay, but I can think of some conception of knowledge
75760	78880	that isn't in the phenomenology of spirit that's coherent.
78880	81120	But that isn't, so to speak,
81120	82800	that isn't sort of argumentatively relevant
82800	84560	to the phenomenology of spirit.
84560	86840	The argument of phenomenology of spirit is if you just
86880	91880	start out with the most primitive thing from itself,
92680	96240	that will develop into knowledge that's so certain
96240	98840	that no skeptical doubt about it can be raised.
100120	102680	Okay, yeah, just one, and then we'll come on.
102680	107680	So, if consciousness alters the standard of knowing,
108520	111200	and then when the standard of knowing changes,
111200	114360	it seems that so does the object that it knows.
114560	118240	So that, how is there ever a one-on-one mapping
118240	121160	of the object and the standard of knowing?
121160	122360	How do they ever meet?
122360	124640	When you change the object of knowing,
124640	126120	you also change the knowledge
126120	128000	that you need to know the object.
128000	130560	And that's exactly what we're about to talk about.
130560	133200	Paragraph 87, page 57.
133200	137400	Okay, so for some reason that I actually don't really know,
137400	140120	the phenomenology is always cited by paragraph numbers.
140120	145120	So, in your papers, please cite it by paragraph number.
146000	151000	And just because I want to drill into your mind,
151800	155120	the fact that we are reading this at secondhand,
155120	157240	you're reading it through translation,
157240	160480	cite the marginal page numbers always,
160480	163160	whenever they're given any of our translations.
163160	165440	Because that's the sort of speak real thing.
165440	168040	The page in Pinkert's translation is just,
168040	169800	the page in what Terry Pinkert is telling you,
169800	170640	they will say.
173000	178000	In this exposition of the course of experience,
178080	181800	there is a moment through which the exposition
181800	184120	seems not to correspond
184120	187040	with what is ordinarily understood by experience.
187040	188160	Okay, let me just back up.
188160	189280	I skipped something.
189280	190760	This dialectical movement,
190760	193320	which consciousness practices in its own self,
193320	195120	this is 86,
195120	197000	insofar as for consciousness,
197000	200200	the new true object arises out of this movement
200200	202800	is properly what is called experience.
202800	205480	So Hegel's technical notion of experience
205480	208840	is not when you took a gap year
208840	210560	and traveled through Southeast Asia,
211520	216040	nor is it the Kantian notion of a synthesis of perceptions,
216040	219360	nor is it whatever Locke and Hume think about experience.
219360	220880	It's precisely that.
220880	223160	It's the dialectical movement
223160	225280	by which consciousness realizes
225280	228760	that its conception of knowledge is incoherent,
228760	230840	that it's not a way of knowing the object
230840	232440	that it takes itself to know
232440	235160	and generates a new conception of knowledge
235160	236880	and thereby generates a new conception
236880	238360	of the object of knowledge.
238360	239760	That's what experience is.
241120	241960	Okay.
245400	246480	Sorry, what?
246480	248960	Can you say it's true or there?
248960	252040	No, sorry.
252040	253880	Okay, in this exposition,
253960	257720	in this exposition of the course of experience,
257720	261440	there is a moment through which the exposition
261440	263000	seems not to correspond
263000	266120	with what is ordinarily understood by experience.
266120	269680	The transition, namely from the first object
269680	272520	and the knowing of it to the other object
272520	276400	about which one says that it is learned from experience
276400	278560	was specified in such a way
278560	280800	that the knowing of the first object
280800	284200	or the being for consciousness of the first in itself
284200	287640	is itself supposed to become the second object.
287640	290240	So Hegel's referring back to some stuff that I skipped,
290240	291960	so I'll just summarize it.
291960	295680	So Hegel's idea is if this is the first,
295680	298000	I'll just erase the thought bubble.
301480	302880	I'll erase the thought bubble
302880	305200	because the thought bubble is now just implied
305200	306360	in everything I said.
306360	309080	Everything that I, everything on the blackboard
309080	311880	until further notice is the name of the thought bubble
311880	316400	because the phenomenology is imminent to consciousness.
316400	318920	We're not talking about objects themselves.
318920	322240	We're talking about consciousness's conception of the object.
322240	324840	What consciousness says is the object of knowledge.
326040	328760	Not what we think the object is or what objects are.
330200	331560	Okay.
331560	336560	So Hegel has said, which he's now referring back to,
337560	340680	is that if this is the first shape of consciousness,
342160	344200	the new shape of consciousness
345080	347400	is that what consciousness knows,
359160	364160	the second object is the relationship
365160	370160	of the consciousness to the object in the first shape.
375920	379680	This relationship is what the object is.
379680	381280	I should actually probably know.
385320	386960	Okay.
386960	388040	Now why isn't it?
389800	391520	So let me give you an example.
392480	394120	Here's an example.
396440	400880	In Kant, the critique of theory is it begins
400880	403800	with what Kant thinks of as the natural presupposition.
403800	406680	I know things in themselves.
411360	414520	And I do throw through sensing.
417520	419280	That is, we're intuiting them.
420280	423560	The argument of the transcendental aesthetic
423560	426720	is that this does not relate you to things in themselves.
426720	428400	You don't know things in themselves.
428400	431280	You know their appearances to you.
431280	434040	So what you know is not this,
434040	436040	but how this relates to you
436040	438360	and how it relates to you in this way.
438360	440840	You know not this,
440840	443120	but how this appears to you in intuition.
444120	448880	So Hegel thinks when you find out that you don't know this,
449000	451040	that this is not a way of knowing this,
452600	455680	the next shape of consciousness is that what you know
457200	461520	is that things relating to you in this way.
463040	464240	So in the Kantian example,
464240	469240	this would be the appearance of things in themselves.
474560	477920	So you start out by claiming to know a certain object.
477920	481360	Your knowing isn't a way of knowing that object.
481360	482640	What it's a way of knowing
482640	485840	is how that object relates to you in that relation.
486920	489760	So that the second object is the relation
489760	493440	of the first object to consciousness in the first form.
494320	497880	Or it's the first relation of consciousness to the object.
500520	503400	By contrast, it ordinarily seems that we learn
503400	506720	from experience of the untruth of our first concept
506720	509400	in another object that we perhaps come across
509400	511720	serendipitously and extrinsically,
511720	514720	that the only thing that is left to us
514720	518320	is the pure grasping of what is in and for itself.
518320	523320	Ordinarily we assume that we think we know stuff
523520	525680	and then we come upon some other objects.
525680	529320	We go explore and we're like oh,
529320	530960	that's not what knowledge was,
530960	533920	but that's a merely empirical case
533920	535400	of undermining knowledge.
535400	539280	We're interested in a sort of categorical collapse
539280	541640	of an entire conception of knowledge,
541640	543600	not some particular things of knowledge.
543600	545480	That's like finding out that Fargo
545480	548200	is not the capital of North Dakota.
548200	551920	This observation of the matter is our addition,
551920	554440	whereby this series of, sorry,
554440	557000	however, based on the point of view given above,
557000	560360	the new object shows itself to have come to be
560360	563220	through a reversal of consciousness itself.
563220	567740	So this new object is, it comes to be
567740	571140	through the undermining of this shape of consciousness.
571140	572900	Then there's a kicker.
572900	574980	This observation of the matter,
574980	578420	namely that the object of the second shape of consciousness
578420	582060	is the first relation to the first object.
582060	583980	It's the appearing of things of themselves,
583980	585220	not things of themselves.
586980	591780	This observation of the matter is our addition,
591780	594140	whereby the series of experiences traversed
594140	597540	by consciousness is elevated into a scientific progression
597540	600400	and which is not there for the consciousness
600400	602020	that we are observing.
602020	607020	So this transition and the fact that the second object
608020	610540	is the first relation to the first object
611580	615840	is not, Hegel says, for consciousness.
622300	624460	It is for us.
626620	628140	What does that mean?
628140	632520	What that means is that if we draw the thought bubble,
633660	638020	this shape of consciousness conceives of itself
638020	641100	as knowing this object in this way,
641100	643580	but the fact that this object
643580	648580	is the first relation to the first object
655500	658980	is not something that it is in self-consciousness.
658980	661260	That is to say, the shape of consciousness
661260	664300	does not know that it arose from this.
664300	667300	It's not constitutive of this shape of consciousness
667300	670920	that it is aware of itself as the successor of this.
670920	672900	Because why would it be?
672900	676940	It's not constitutive to knowing this in this way
676940	680940	that you know that you arose from that.
680940	682720	This is our addition.
683740	685660	So there's a distinction in the phenomenology,
685660	687540	in every scene of the phenomenology,
687540	692380	between what is for us and what is for consciousness.
692380	694140	That is to say, there's a distinction between
694140	696500	what we say about consciousness
696500	698860	and what consciousness says about itself.
698860	700920	And what consciousness says about itself
700940	702760	has to always be imminently developed
702760	704720	from consciousness itself.
704720	709720	So the for us remarks can be preliminary
711280	713640	or they can indicate the shape of the science,
713640	716960	but they can't themselves be,
716960	719080	they can't include the undermining.
721080	724640	Otherwise, the imminence of the exposition would be.
726160	729960	So what we do scientifically is order these things
730040	731320	in this way.
731320	733440	But that, this thing undermines itself
733440	735200	is not something we do to it.
735200	736320	It does it to itself.
737340	740480	But we, what's sometimes referred to
740480	742240	as the phenomenological observer,
742240	744880	the reader and the author of the phenomenology,
744880	747960	we order these shapes of consciousness in this way.
747960	750160	And that generates a scientific development.
751360	754040	So now we have a principled reason
754040	758400	for the beginning, the order, and the end.
758400	760420	And in any Hegelian science,
760420	763320	you always have to ask yourself where it begins,
763320	766320	what the principle of movement of it is,
766320	767480	and where it ends.
769000	771660	Okay, reading a little bit further.
771660	775360	However, this is in fact also the same situation
775360	777600	already discussed above concerning the relation
777600	779680	of the exposition to skepticism.
779680	782240	Namely, that each and every result which emerges
782240	785040	from a non-truthful knowing should not coalesce
785040	786600	into an empty nothing,
786600	788520	but rather must necessarily be grasped
788520	791760	as a nothing of that of which it is the result.
791760	793680	A result which contains the truth
793680	796760	that the previous knowing has within itself.
796760	801120	So this result is not an abstract nothing.
801120	803100	It's not just the giving up on knowledge.
803100	806560	It's this determinant negation of this.
806560	808600	It's, there's something it isn't.
808600	809520	It isn't that.
811040	815480	It's for us specifically not that shape of consciousness
815480	818280	because that shape of consciousness undermined itself.
819560	824560	And this relation is what Hegel calls being the truth of.
835600	838520	So what that means is this,
838520	842880	when it thinks itself fully undermines itself,
842920	847920	and this is what resolves the problem in a principled way.
848080	851600	So this contains whatever was true in this.
852880	857880	Now that means truth is not on or off.
858220	859720	Things are not true or not.
861000	862680	Truth here is a relational notion,
862680	865040	being the truth of something else.
865040	867700	And so things can be more or less true.
867700	868920	This is the truth of that.
868920	872080	The third shape is the truth of the second shape.
872120	874840	As we do this, we get truer and truer.
877280	879760	Now truth for Hegel is gonna turn out to be
879760	883060	the agreement of something with its concept.
884240	887940	So what this is is,
895200	898040	knowledge becoming more and more
898040	899920	in agreement with its concept.
899920	902000	Now what is the concept of knowledge?
902800	903640	We don't know yet.
903640	906600	It's up to consciousness to say.
906600	909880	It's up to the exposition of the phenomenology
909880	913120	to unfold from consciousness what the concept
913120	914400	of knowledge is.
914400	917000	If we just said what the concept of knowledge is
917000	920400	from the beginning, we would be begging the question.
920400	922400	We would be falling into the second form
922400	923960	of the dilemma of the criteria.
925320	926160	Yeah.
926160	928520	Can you explain what it means for something
928520	931580	to contain the truth of something else?
932420	934420	In what sense does the thing on the left
934420	935260	contain the truth of it?
935260	938580	I mean in a certain way, this schematic diagram
938580	941060	is all that can be said about that.
941060	944960	What for something to contain the truth of something else
944960	949960	is for it to be the principled successor to that.
951780	956400	So X is the truth of Y if X is the principled successor
956400	960460	of Y in virtue of Y negating itself.
962540	963380	Yes.
963380	964780	Yes, I have a question.
964780	966620	You've been making a distinction between
966620	968060	what we say about consciousness
968060	970140	and what consciousness says for itself.
970140	975140	But anything we assert as consciousness says for itself,
977740	979700	we're saying it equals something.
979700	980540	Sorry, say that again?
980540	981540	Okay.
981540	984780	So there's the distinction between what we say
984780	989620	about consciousness, namely we order the past consciousness
989660	993700	and what consciousness says for itself.
995540	998860	But how can making this at all means
998860	1002540	whatever the wire gets cut by others?
1002540	1003380	Yeah, okay.
1003380	1006740	So by consciousness, Hegel doesn't mean
1006740	1008300	like consciousness in general.
1008300	1010660	He means by a particular shape of consciousness.
1011740	1013300	Of course, we're conscious.
1013300	1016900	But when Hegel refers to something as consciousness,
1016900	1020660	he means it's consciousness and nothing more.
1020660	1023500	Not, and this goes back to a point from earlier,
1023500	1027460	not that it isn't in any way that further thing,
1027460	1030260	but it hasn't yet grasped itself as that further thing.
1031560	1034660	So Hegel won't call us consciousness,
1034660	1036220	although of course we're conscious,
1036220	1038180	because we are something more.
1038180	1041540	In particular, insofar as you are reading
1041540	1042860	the phenomenology of spirit,
1042860	1046080	you're always one step ahead of a shape of consciousness.
1046080	1048660	You always know something more than it about itself.
1048660	1051040	So you are not merely identical
1051040	1052780	with that shape of consciousness.
1052780	1055560	So one way of distinguishing this
1055560	1058520	is thinking about what a shape of consciousness
1058520	1061040	is implicitly and what it is explicitly.
1061040	1062560	All of these shapes of consciousness
1062560	1064500	are implicitly spirit.
1064500	1067180	They're implicitly absolute no.
1067180	1072180	Because they contain in themselves the imminent criteria,
1072300	1074880	which when thought through by themselves
1074880	1076220	will lead to absolute no.
1077740	1079840	But they are not explicitly absolute no.
1081080	1086080	So we are, I'm more than just implicitly consciousness.
1086960	1090280	I'm explicitly something more than consciousness.
1090280	1092720	And so Hegel won't refer to me
1092720	1094920	or himself as mere consciousness.
1096520	1097360	Yeah.
1097360	1100680	So choosing the successor of truth,
1100680	1102760	it's like, for example,
1102760	1104960	is there a absurd stage of consciousness?
1104960	1108560	That's the truth of the first stage of consciousness,
1108560	1110960	also preserved and disturbed in the system.
1110960	1111800	Yes, yes.
1111800	1113680	So the truth of is transitive.
1115960	1117920	So we're going to try to figure that out.
1117920	1119200	So you guys speak up.
1119200	1121320	Oh, we're going to be trying to figure that distinction
1121320	1124600	between consciousness as we felt a number more
1124600	1127480	and consciousness, what we can claim about it,
1127480	1131920	could be similar to how we can claim thought and object.
1131920	1134400	So we are making claims about consciousness
1134400	1135880	as it appears to us,
1135880	1138880	just to speak between us making a claim about consciousness
1138880	1142280	and consciousness as it's also looking more important.
1142280	1146440	Yes, except that our claims about consciousness
1146440	1150680	are not supposed to be one of the shapes of consciousness
1150680	1152240	in this sequence.
1152240	1153080	Thank you.
1153080	1154760	Okay, let me just, let me just,
1154760	1156720	let's just read a little bit further.
1156720	1159560	However, this is in fact also the same situation
1159560	1161600	already discussed above concerning the relation
1161640	1163520	of this exposition to skepticism,
1163520	1164800	namely that each and every result
1164800	1166480	which emerges from a non-truthful known
1166480	1168360	should not coalesce into an empty nothing.
1168360	1171000	So not just the rejection of knowledge,
1171000	1172840	but rather must be necessarily grasped
1172840	1175120	as the nothing of that of which it is the result,
1175120	1176720	or result which contains the truth
1176720	1179040	that the previous knowing has within itself.
1179040	1181120	Here it presents itself as follows.
1181120	1182880	Well, what at first appeared as the object
1182880	1186400	generating for consciousness into a knowing of the object,
1186400	1189960	and in itself becomes a being for consciousness
1189960	1192920	of the in itself, the latter is the new object,
1192920	1195320	the being of consciousness for the in itself.
1195320	1197280	That's this point.
1197280	1200880	The being of consciousness for the object is the new object.
1200880	1203240	The previous being of object,
1203240	1205000	being of the object for consciousness,
1205000	1207000	that's what this is, is the new object.
1208600	1212320	As a result, a new shape of consciousness comes on the scene
1212320	1215000	for which the essence is something different
1215000	1216960	from what was the essence for the preceding shape.
1216960	1219560	Okay, so let me just say something about the word essence.
1219560	1221760	Hegel has this, the word here is vesen.
1224840	1227960	So now vesen in German is more general
1227960	1232120	than essence in English.
1233080	1237520	It can be a being, like an entity can also be a vesen.
1237520	1242520	So what Hegel means by vesen is whatever the standard
1243000	1246480	of whatever it is that knowledge has to correspond to
1246480	1248200	in order to count as knowledge.
1248200	1249640	So you might think, well, isn't that just
1249640	1250760	what the object is?
1252000	1254240	Yes, at the beginning, but over the course
1254240	1257080	of the phenomenology, something other than the object
1257080	1259560	is going to come to count as the vesen.
1259560	1264360	So the progress of the phenomenology is that consciousness,
1264360	1267480	knowing something that's an object will turn out
1267480	1268880	to be incoherent.
1268880	1271800	And then the vesen will turn out to be the subject.
1271800	1274880	It will turn out to be that what the subject has to do
1274880	1278080	in order to know objects is come into an agreement
1278080	1279520	with itself.
1279520	1281360	But we're not going to actually read those sections
1281360	1282880	of phenomenology.
1282880	1286000	So just understand, vesen is like a functional term.
1286000	1289800	It means whatever is that which knowledge has to correspond
1289800	1293440	to or agree with in order to be knowledge.
1293440	1297160	But for now, the object is playing the vesen term.
1300040	1304160	And in fact, consciousness is more or less identified,
1305120	1309160	or identical for Hegel, with a conception of knowledge
1309160	1312120	with the object plays the role of vesen.
1312120	1315680	Okay, this is what's so great about only teaching
1315680	1316880	the easy parts of Hegel.
1318880	1321280	In case you're wondering, this is like the easiest
1321280	1322360	ten pages of Hegel.
1323800	1326360	Okay, as a result of, if you guys go,
1326360	1327600	oh, I don't know how I'm getting through this,
1327600	1331720	like you have no idea, like it won't get that bad
1331720	1335240	in this class, but it gets infinitely worse than this.
1335240	1338840	As a result, a new shape of consciousness comes on the scene,
1338840	1341200	you can already read that, is this circumstance
1341200	1344280	which guides the whole series of shapes of consciousness
1344280	1345680	in their necessity.
1346640	1348280	So that's super crucial.
1348280	1351280	The progression of the shapes of consciousness
1351280	1353360	has to be necessary.
1353360	1356560	There has to be no arbitrariness or contingency
1356560	1359400	in one shape of consciousness being the successor
1359400	1360560	to the previous one.
1360600	1362720	That's why the merely historical reading
1362720	1364880	of the phenomenology has to be wrong.
1365800	1368480	The fact that one shape of consciousness
1368480	1371120	historically succeeds another,
1371120	1375120	it does not by itself demonstrate any necessity.
1375120	1378320	So if all this were, were a super high level
1378320	1380800	philosophical account of intellectual history,
1380800	1383000	it would demonstrate nothing about necessity.
1384280	1388880	What it could be, so there's like the pure historical reading,
1388880	1393560	this is literally just a catalog of what happens in history
1393560	1396040	but described in terms of historical period
1396040	1399160	self conceptions, that can't be right.
1399160	1403320	What it could be right is it's a description, it's that,
1403320	1407000	plus each of those historically extant conceptions
1407000	1411040	of knowledge incoherently undermines itself
1411040	1412960	and necessitates the next one.
1412960	1416800	So that's a little bit better, still wrong because A,
1416800	1418360	Hegel explicitly says that it's false,
1418800	1421080	the book ends, Hegel says something that's completely
1421080	1423440	in the battle with that, which we will read.
1423440	1425520	And furthermore, the chronology is wrong.
1425520	1429280	In fact, Newtonian science occurred after the ancient Greeks.
1429280	1431360	So, sorry guys, okay.
1432840	1435320	There's very few pure historical readers
1435320	1437040	of the phenomenology of the spirit left
1437040	1439160	but I have like a bad reaction to this
1439160	1442800	because I survived my first Hegel class partly
1442800	1446200	by just ingesting Michael Forster's book
1446200	1447960	about the phenomenology of the spirit.
1448400	1449240	The first half of which is very good,
1449240	1451000	it's all about Hegel's response to skepticism
1451000	1452760	but the rest of which is just the pure intellectual
1452760	1455480	distribution of phenomenology, which is very,
1455480	1457560	which is bad in pernicious.
1457560	1460320	However, it is just this necessity itself
1460320	1462480	or the emergence of the new object
1462480	1465040	which presents itself to consciousness
1465040	1468880	without consciousness knowing how this happens to it.
1468880	1473880	So this consciousness is unaware of its own history.
1474000	1476920	Now at a certain point in the phenomenology,
1476920	1481000	that will change and a shape of consciousness
1481000	1484400	will become explicitly self-conscious
1484400	1487120	of its development out of logically prior
1487120	1488400	to self-consciousness.
1488400	1489920	But we're not there yet.
1492920	1495200	Through this, there enters into the movement
1495200	1498160	of consciousness a moment of the in itself
1498160	1500080	or of being for us.
1500080	1502640	So this is a different use of in itself.
1502640	1506420	So sometimes Hegel uses in itself to mean this.
1507120	1510640	Sometimes what Hegel means but in itself
1510640	1515640	is a contrast between what is in itself and for itself.
1521720	1525240	And that approximately means what something
1525240	1530240	implicitly is without grasping it.
1532600	1536200	And for itself, what explicitly it is
1537920	1541800	what it grasps itself as such.
1543440	1548520	So let me give you an example.
1553880	1557240	Let's use the standard bad movie, The Hero.
1558960	1563960	Luke Skywalker is the savior of the galaxy
1564960	1569960	and the savior of the Jedi in himself from the beginning.
1570640	1575640	But only in Return of the Jedi is he that form himself.
1575700	1578900	I shy away from Star Wars examples
1578900	1581560	because I find that they're one of the few pieces
1581560	1586000	of pop culture that I share, that I know,
1586000	1587680	that my students also know.
1587680	1591000	And so then I tend to use them too much.
1591000	1593800	And then people think that I'm way more into Star Wars.
1594680	1598200	So then I will try, I will try to use the Star Wars
1598200	1599320	reference experiment.
1601160	1606160	Theologically, Jesus is the son of God in himself
1606600	1609580	before he takes on or accepts that identity.
1609580	1612280	Then he is the son of God for himself.
1614960	1618680	It is this circumstance, however it is just this necessity.
1618680	1622480	So these shapes of consciousness are in themselves
1623840	1626560	gauges on the path to absolute nothing.
1626560	1629640	But they are not those for themselves
1629640	1631800	because consciousness is not aware of that.
1631800	1634720	And in the phenomenology, the in itself,
1634720	1639400	but not for itself, can be identified with what is for us
1639400	1641120	and not for consciousness.
1641120	1644860	So in the phenomenology we can identify these risks,
1644860	1649860	what is for us, and what is for consciousness.
1654280	1655640	Okay.
1655640	1658600	So just a note on Hegelian tactical terminology.
1659760	1662560	People, I've had this experience multiple times
1662560	1663400	that students would be like,
1663400	1664880	I've been reading the phenomenology on my own
1664880	1665800	and I totally get it.
1665800	1667760	Could you just tell me though what the in itself
1667760	1669360	and the for itself are?
1669360	1672320	And the reason that question is very hard to answer
1672320	1674520	and slightly frustrating to be asked
1674520	1678640	is the meaning of Hegel's tactical terminology,
1678640	1681240	like everything else, has to be developed
1681280	1683480	imminently over the course of the science.
1684520	1687520	So these are to some extent like my external remarks
1687520	1690740	because I've read this book many times helping you along.
1690740	1694240	But properly speaking, the meaning of the in itself
1694240	1696400	or the for itself is going to change
1696400	1698320	over the course of the phenomenology.
1698320	1700000	So the only thing that we can say
1700000	1701960	that's like genuinely true illuminating
1701960	1704360	is some kind of like general structural features
1704360	1706120	of how these terms are used.
1706120	1708960	And in particular, when we get to the logic,
1709960	1712000	I'll actually, the in itself is actually in the part
1712000	1713320	of the logic we want to talk about.
1713320	1717720	The logic develops in principle and purely imminently
1717720	1720520	the pure technical meaning of these terms.
1725280	1727000	Which does not present itself for the consciousness
1727000	1729680	which is itself comprehended in the experience itself.
1729680	1732420	However, the content of what emerges to us
1732420	1734160	is for consciousness.
1734160	1736800	And we comprehend only what is formal in it
1736800	1738460	or its pure emergence.
1738480	1743300	For consciousness, what is emerged is only as object.
1743300	1745780	That is to say, what's emerged is an object
1745780	1747140	that it claims to know.
1747140	1749900	For us, what is emerged is that the same time emerges
1749900	1752460	as movement and coming to be.
1752460	1756380	But we understand this as having come to be from that.
1756380	1758700	Well remember, movement is just the name
1758700	1762260	for this purely conceptual process
1762260	1766020	of one conception of knowledge undermining itself
1766020	1768940	and giving rise purely logically to another.
1768940	1770780	And this process and this movement
1770780	1772180	is not happening in time.
1773700	1778340	Okay, through this necessity, this path to science
1778340	1781260	is itself already science.
1783180	1785280	Earlier he said, this doesn't appear to be science,
1785280	1788780	but now he's telling you, this is actually science.
1788780	1790900	But we don't know what science is.
1790900	1794660	So that is a provisional remark for something
1794660	1796540	that will have to be proven by the end of the book.
1796540	1799520	In fact, in doing the science of logic,
1799520	1801140	sorry, the phonology of spirit,
1801140	1802940	we are actually doing science.
1802940	1804540	This is actually scientific now.
1806260	1808860	And according to its content, it is thereby the science
1808860	1811140	of the experience of consciousness.
1811140	1814420	Okay, now those of you who pay very close attention,
1814420	1816140	actually this may not have been in the reading,
1816140	1818060	but if you have a copy of the book,
1818060	1821380	you'll notice that the title page of this book
1821380	1824180	is Science of the Experience of Consciousness.
1824180	1828040	So if you look at this book, it has one title page
1828040	1832340	that says, Phenomenology of Spirit,
1832340	1835600	and then it has a preface and an introduction.
1835600	1837860	And then there's another title page saying,
1837860	1840020	Science of the Experience of Consciousness.
1840020	1842260	Why does this book have two titles?
1842260	1845260	The reason is that the original title of this book
1845260	1848160	was the Science of the Experience of Consciousness.
1848160	1851680	Halfway through the book, Hegel decided
1851680	1853740	that it needed a second half
1853740	1855060	and that it should bear the title,
1855060	1857020	Phenomenology of Spirit.
1857020	1860060	The problem is the first half of the book had been printed.
1861420	1863220	And in the early 19th century,
1863220	1865580	paper is very, very valuable.
1865580	1870580	So the printer was not gonna pulp half of a book.
1873060	1876540	So instead, they printed the rest of the book
1876540	1878160	with the original title page
1878160	1880340	and then just added another title page.
1880340	1881180	And you can in fact,
1881220	1883300	that card first has proven this
1883300	1888020	by examining the very most original first editions
1888020	1889620	of the Phenomenology of Spirit.
1889620	1891500	So here at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library,
1891500	1893420	we have one of the very early editions,
1893420	1895300	but there were even earlier ones.
1895300	1897140	This is maybe boring, but it's extremely interesting
1897140	1899580	to me, so I'm gonna bore you with it.
1899580	1901540	There was a practice.
1901540	1905940	So book publishers were also booksellers in,
1905940	1908860	sorry, printers were also booksellers
1909500	1911260	in the early 19th century.
1911260	1915780	So a publisher or a printer that was publishing a book,
1915780	1918140	you could subscribe to that book
1918140	1921780	and they would send you the parts of the book
1921780	1923620	as they were getting printed.
1923620	1926900	So an 18th century book is printed
1926900	1928380	on these gigantic pieces of paper
1928380	1931860	that are folded together and then they print off them.
1931860	1934340	You could subscribe and as those got printed,
1934340	1935860	they would send them to you.
1935860	1938180	And then when the whole thing was done,
1938180	1940860	you would send it back, they would bind it together
1940860	1942460	and then you'd have your book.
1942460	1945420	And so Eckhart first found one of these
1945420	1947100	of the Phenomenology of Spirit
1947100	1951100	and he proved on the basis of the folds of the page
1951100	1956100	that the original first fold of the Phenomenology of Spirit
1956780	1960540	has the title, Science of the Experience of Consciousness
1960540	1964300	and then when they asked for everybody's folds back,
1964300	1966400	they cut off a couple of pages
1966400	1968200	and then added the rest of it.
1968200	1970560	And he has a claim about these various pages
1970560	1974000	in Hegel's not lost the papers that were left
1974000	1977160	over his death about what those missing pages are.
1977160	1978280	This unfortunately is not something
1978280	1979840	we're gonna be able to cover in this class.
1979840	1981920	Now I realize that this may be very sad.
1981920	1986920	Okay, so why did he go from calling it
1988080	1990680	a science of the experience of consciousness
1990680	1992280	to the Phenomenology of Spirit?
1993320	1996200	Because the original plan of the book
1996360	2001360	is that it ends, so the book was originally supposed
2001720	2006720	to contain consciousness, self-consciousness,
2013320	2014160	and reason.
2017640	2022640	Spirit is where the, this is the original plan.
2022920	2024200	This is the original plan.
2024200	2026520	This is something called the Four Phenomenology.
2026520	2028840	This is where the second half of the book starts.
2028840	2030720	So the original plan of the book
2030720	2032760	didn't have the spirit section.
2032760	2036960	So then for some reason, Hegel decided
2036960	2039960	the book needed a second half
2039960	2043840	that includes spirit, religion, and absolute damage.
2046560	2048560	Yeah, spirit, religion, and absolute damage.
2048560	2053560	And he decided that what the whole thing is
2058480	2061640	is not just the science of the experience of consciousness
2061640	2063440	but the Phenomenology of Spirit.
2069680	2072480	So really, this is what was originally
2072480	2074880	the science of the experience of consciousness.
2075880	2078000	So now it's possible, and this is the kind of thing
2078000	2079360	that we would have to deal with
2079360	2081440	if we were doing a class of the whole Phenomenology,
2081440	2084680	that this description of the project of the Phenomenology
2084680	2086640	applies only to this.
2086640	2089760	And then, imminently, within the reason section,
2089760	2092960	we transition to a different project.
2092960	2096600	I don't think that's quite right, but regardless,
2096600	2097800	what does it mean that the whole thing
2097800	2099240	is a Phenomenology of Spirit?
2099240	2100840	Okay, so now this goes back to a question
2100840	2102040	that was asked earlier.
2104200	2105400	Who asked this question?
2105400	2107280	The meeting of Phenomenology.
2107320	2108520	Yes, Isaac, okay.
2108520	2112400	So Phenomenology, right, just linguistically,
2113720	2117080	means the logos of Phenomena.
2118000	2120360	Oh, this board is really messy, I apologize for that.
2120360	2122880	But it might just, you know, they do not need to,
2122880	2126280	they do not need to add weight for this.
2130400	2133640	Okay, Phenomenology.
2137280	2142280	This is the logos, or the rational account of Phenomena,
2152000	2153080	of Appearance.
2155320	2160320	So this is the science of the Appearance of Spirit.
2160320	2165320	So it's the scientific account of how Spirit appears
2170800	2175440	up until, or up and until, Spirit is fully
2175440	2176880	in and for itself.
2176880	2180000	It's fully explicit for itself that it's Spirit.
2180000	2182000	Now, what is the appearance of Spirit?
2182000	2184520	It's not like Spirit is, it's the appearance
2184520	2186160	of Spirit to Spirit.
2186160	2190640	It's the appearance of Spirit to consciousness.
2190640	2194560	Consciousness is ever more adequate conception
2194560	2195760	of itself as Spirit.
2197440	2198960	So this is what I was talking about before.
2198960	2202720	That means consciousness is ever more truthful,
2202720	2205560	ever more adequate conception of it not being
2205560	2207880	fundamentally different from anything else.
2207880	2211200	Of there not being anything that's radically distinct
2211200	2212040	from Spirit.
2212040	2213440	There's no outside to Spirit.
2213440	2215320	There are things that are distinct from Spirit,
2215360	2216800	but their fundamental structure is the same
2216800	2218040	as the structure of Spirit.
2218040	2220560	And so all of being, all of reality is in principle
2220560	2221760	transparent to Spirit.
2221760	2224040	It's in principle transparent to knowing.
2224040	2228840	Okay, so that means that this introduction
2228840	2231720	is not an introduction to the Phenomenology of Spirit.
2231720	2233680	It's an introduction to the science of the Experience
2233680	2235120	of Consciousness.
2235120	2236960	That's why there's no explanation of why it's called
2236960	2238360	a Phenomenology of Spirit.
2238360	2240360	Although there is an explanation of why it's the science
2240360	2242160	of the Experience of Consciousness.
2243080	2246480	And it means that something really important happened
2246480	2249600	because Hegel decided that the book could not end here.
2250720	2253680	So once again, in a complete account of the Phenomenology
2253680	2255920	of Spirit, we would have to,
2255920	2258520	this transition is really crucial.
2258520	2260560	Why does the book not end with reason?
2260560	2262160	Why does it move to Spirit?
2262160	2264360	And what is the particular nature of Spirit?
2266600	2270320	Okay, so let's just do the last paragraph.
2270320	2272800	The experience through which consciousness learns
2272800	2275800	about itself can, according to its concept,
2275800	2278560	comprehend within itself nothing less
2278560	2281040	than the whole system of consciousness.
2281040	2284440	Okay, so this is an obsession of German philosophy
2284440	2288200	between Kant and Hegel, the systematicity of science.
2288200	2289840	So we don't wanna just have science.
2289840	2291360	Science has to be a system.
2291360	2294520	However, Hegel hasn't imminently justified
2294520	2296000	the notion of system.
2296000	2298160	That he's gonna have to do.
2298160	2300520	So this is a provisional remark
2300520	2301840	for something that's gonna come.
2301840	2304760	And we'll talk about when we get to Hegel's system,
2304760	2306160	in what way it's systematic.
2307040	2308840	Nothing less than the whole system of consciousness
2308840	2310880	or the whole realm of the truth of spirit.
2310880	2313040	So the moments of truth present themselves
2313040	2315200	in this, their proper determinateness,
2315200	2317440	not as being abstract pure moments,
2317440	2320080	but rather in the way that they are for consciousness
2320080	2322160	or in the way that consciousness itself comes
2322160	2324040	on the scene in relation to that.
2324040	2326520	In this way, the moments of the whole
2326520	2328120	are shapes of consciousness.
2328960	2331240	So the moments of the whole are the individual aspects
2331240	2333160	or parts of this development
2333160	2336040	from natural consciousness to absolute known.
2336040	2338120	By consciousness carrying a word
2338120	2339960	on towards its true existence,
2339960	2342800	it will reach a point where it sets aside
2342800	2346400	its semblance of being burdened with what is alien.
2346400	2350240	So the end point of the phenomenology is willing to be
2350240	2353680	in part giving up what Hegel here describes
2353680	2357480	as a semblance, the idea that consciousness is burdened
2357480	2360320	with an object distinct from itself that it has to know.
2361280	2363320	Absolute knowing, as I said before,
2363320	2365960	is gonna involve some kind of getting rid
2365960	2367480	of the distinctness of the object
2367480	2370280	or a collapse of the subject and the object together
2370280	2372400	so that no possible distinction
2372400	2374400	between subject and object can arise
2374400	2377240	that would generate the skeptical problems
2377240	2379480	that undermine previous shapes of consciousness.
2380960	2384080	A point where the appearance becomes equal to the essence,
2384080	2386800	the essence being that which has to be known,
2386800	2389360	the appearance being its relationship to consciousness,
2389360	2393160	so that its own exposition coincides at this very point
2393160	2395640	with the genuine science of spirit
2395640	2400440	so that this exposition will itself also have been,
2400440	2404440	will turn out to be a scientific knowing of what spirit is.
2404440	2407480	Finally, while itself grasping this, its own essence,
2407480	2409560	consciousness will signify the nature
2409560	2411220	of absolute knowing itself.
2411220	2413920	So just to anticipate slightly spoiler alert,
2414840	2418360	this joke that people like to make on Twitter,
2418360	2421000	the real journey, the real destination
2421000	2422840	was the friends we made along the way.
2422840	2427440	This is in a certain way the key idea of Hegel.
2427440	2430480	Or the slightly less jokey version,
2430480	2432240	the journey is the destination.
2432240	2435960	That in a certain way, I'll try to justify this philosophically
2435960	2437080	over the course of this semester
2437080	2438720	and make this not sound so silly.
2438720	2441320	That in a certain way is the key idea of Hegel.
2441320	2446320	That actually, what absolute knowing is going to be,
2446680	2449680	is going to turn out to be what we've been doing all along.
2451720	2453920	So the end of the phenomenology of spirit,
2453920	2455760	the end of all of Hegel's books
2455760	2457720	have this weird, dissatisfying character.
2457720	2460600	You're like, wait, I wanted to know what absolute knowing was.
2460600	2462040	Why can't you tell me?
2462040	2465640	And the answer is, you've been owning absolutely all along.
2465640	2468400	But you've been absolutely knowing in itself.
2469360	2472160	At the end, you have absolute knowledge for itself.
2472160	2474840	You absolutely, you explicitly grasp
2474840	2477440	what you've been doing all along as absolute knowing.
2479760	2482240	And that is one of the reasons,
2482240	2485080	if the journey is the destination,
2485080	2489080	then the content of Hegel's philosophy,
2489080	2493000	the P in Hegel, is the way you get to the P.
2494800	2496640	They're inseparable.
2496680	2499160	Which means Hegel cannot cut to the chase.
2500480	2504480	That means there's no way for Hegel to communicate
2504480	2507640	the so-called content of Hegel's thought,
2507640	2509760	other than by you doing it yourself.
2511360	2514520	That is why the books are so hard to read.
2514520	2518440	You have to rethink every of Hegel's ideas
2518440	2520880	in order to understand every one of the claims.
2522200	2524800	There's no choice in reading Hegel,
2524800	2529320	but to recapitulate the thought of Hegel
2530320	2532720	in grasping the thought of Hegel.
2532720	2535360	If there was a distinction between form and content,
2535360	2539440	there could be P, and there could be my argument that P,
2539440	2541240	and those would be different things.
2542320	2544320	But for Hegel, they're one and the same.
2545760	2548520	Which means that they aren't a value of P.
2548520	2551680	Because P cannot be identical to an argument that P.
2551680	2554520	I mean, it's a very bad argument that P.
2555160	2557120	I mean, it's a value, right?
2557120	2560200	And for many values of P, it is sound as well.
2560200	2562680	But still, a very valid argument.
2562680	2566280	So in some sense, where the phenomenology of spirit
2566280	2571280	is going to end is that this has been absolute knowing
2572560	2573400	all along.
2575080	2576800	Sounds super weird, sounds kind of oaky,
2576800	2578240	sounds slightly new-agey.
2578240	2580600	But I hope that I will be able to false off and justify it
2580600	2582840	as not totally stupid over the course of this much.
2582840	2584800	Okay, we have some time.
2584800	2587120	I just want to say, those who have taken classes
2587120	2590320	with me before know that I tend not to keep to the syllabus,
2590320	2591960	I tend to slow down.
2591960	2593400	I think in my entire life,
2593400	2596400	I have never actually kept to a syllabus.
2596400	2600360	I think one time, I only was like one week behind,
2600360	2601960	or even like half a week behind.
2603320	2605960	It's possible that I will slow down from the syllabus.
2606960	2608920	But there is, I have in my mind,
2608920	2612020	a kind of condensed version where we can speed
2612060	2613260	through certain things,
2613260	2615740	and we'll still start at the beginning and get to the end.
2615740	2620380	So we'll see the big structure of Hegel's system,
2620380	2621940	even if we speed through certain things
2621940	2623780	or slow down on other things.
2623780	2624820	Questions?
2624820	2625660	Yes.
2625660	2629180	So when they say P is the right to get to the P,
2629180	2631220	so what's the meaning of experience?
2632660	2637540	Experience is, as Hegel says,
2637540	2642020	consciousness undermining one's conception of knowledge,
2642020	2644580	which gives rise to another conception of knowledge.
2644580	2647100	That's what experience is.
2647100	2650460	In a certain way, absolute knowing
2650460	2653020	is not the experience of consciousness,
2653020	2655460	but the science of the experience of consciousness.
2655460	2659400	It's that experience in its systematic totalitarian,
2659400	2663620	a principled beginning, a principled law of the series,
2663620	2665060	and a principled end.
2665060	2665900	Yeah.
2665940	2669060	So is consciousness here a proper noun,
2669060	2671140	like as you're referring to an entity,
2671140	2673860	or is it just a functional world,
2673860	2678860	like in point to that you're conscious of something
2678900	2682380	that's like a function, not like an entity by itself?
2683580	2687260	I mean, my inclination is to respond to you
2687260	2689500	by saying that that's a false dichotomy,
2689500	2691700	because functions are entities,
2691700	2695100	and consciousness is definitely a noun, just grammatically.
2695220	2696380	But I feel like there's something
2696380	2698180	that's more behind your question.
2698180	2701700	So what lies behind this question?
2701700	2706380	So what lies behind the question is that if consciousness
2706380	2710380	is just a functional world and just a status that I just,
2710380	2712300	that something is always cognizing,
2712300	2714380	or like conscious of something,
2714380	2718620	and that process is like constantly rebooting itself,
2718620	2721220	and it's not aware that it's even clear of itself,
2721220	2723460	so it's always for itself.
2723620	2726620	If consciousness is a proper noun,
2726620	2729060	as like you're referring to an entity,
2729060	2732740	then it can sort of like have passed and recognize
2732740	2736260	the always immediately present in the world.
2736260	2737700	Okay, so what I would say is,
2737700	2740060	we're talking about consciousness,
2740060	2742660	we're not talking about particular conscious subject.
2742660	2743900	Why are we doing that?
2743900	2746180	Because we're not interested in this conscious subject
2746180	2747540	or that conscious subject,
2747540	2750140	we're interested in what consciousness is.
2750140	2753140	Okay, now, so we're at one level
2753140	2754780	above individual conscious subject.
2756260	2760300	Furthermore, consciousness is relational.
2760300	2763580	Consciousness is consciousness of something else.
2763580	2767620	In fact, even consciousness will turn into self-consciousness,
2768540	2771420	which does not mean that consciousness is not self-conscious
2771420	2772780	in the ordinary sense from the beginning,
2772780	2775220	because as you see, consciousness has a conception
2775220	2776900	of itself as consciousness.
2776900	2779500	That is to say, in the ordinary sense, it's self-conscious.
2779500	2781220	So we're not gonna read in this class
2781220	2783500	the transition from consciousness to self-consciousness.
2783500	2785780	But there's this thing that people,
2785780	2787500	there's this reading that you sometimes hear
2787500	2791180	where somehow, human beings were not conscious
2791180	2792580	until they started fighting each other
2792580	2794500	and then they became self-conscious,
2794500	2795820	which is always very strict,
2795820	2798700	because animals manage to fight each other.
2798700	2800860	You look at them without being self,
2800860	2803020	put two babies together, they won't fight each other,
2803020	2804100	like wrestle with each other,
2804100	2806340	but that's not turned them into self,
2806340	2807820	makes them self-conscious.
2807900	2811140	Of self-consciousness as the second part
2811140	2812500	of the phenomenal energy of spirit
2812500	2815180	does not refer to self-consciousness
2815180	2816460	in the ordinary sense,
2816460	2820100	but the idea that what consciousness is of,
2820100	2821420	what knowledge is of,
2822860	2825340	the essence that makes knowledge knowledge
2825340	2827300	is consciousness is knowledge of itself.
2828900	2830620	So that consciousness,
2830620	2833900	it sort of speaks self-conscious knowledge of objects.
2833900	2834980	What it needs to know,
2834980	2837420	what it needs to match its representation to
2837540	2838940	is the object.
2838940	2843740	Self-consciousness is self-conscious knowledge of itself.
2843740	2846820	What it needs to match its representation to is itself,
2846820	2849340	including its representations of objects.
2849340	2851940	So consciousness for Hegel,
2851940	2854180	even self-consciousness is always relational,
2855100	2856900	even if it's a relation to itself.
2856900	2859700	So in that sense, maybe that's what you mean by functional.
2861020	2864540	Consciousness is not, so to speak, an intrinsic property.
2864700	2868260	Does your ever-subscribing impact on Hegel's ideal
2868260	2869940	implicit and explicit?
2869940	2870780	Yes.
2870780	2873500	Hegel says at the beginning of the philosophy of spirit
2873500	2875980	that the only thing worth reading about mind,
2875980	2878860	aside from, of course, him, is Aristotle's Diana.
2880860	2881700	Maybe not the only thing,
2881700	2883900	the best thing ever given by the mind is Diana.
2883900	2885620	So Hegel thinks of himself,
2885620	2887180	Hegel's attitude towards true philosophy,
2887180	2889540	which we will get to at the end of the course,
2889540	2893660	is that the history of philosophy is,
2893980	2896700	all of these things that we're gonna describe in Hegel,
2896700	2900460	so there is a, one of the many distorted ways
2900460	2902260	in which Hegel has been received
2902260	2903940	is to think of Hegel as fundamentally
2903940	2905140	a philosopher of history.
2906220	2907860	Hegel is a philosopher of history.
2907860	2909740	Maybe, probably the best,
2909740	2912340	deepest philosopher of history ever.
2912340	2915460	But the stuff that we're talking about is not historical.
2915460	2918300	The fundamental stuff in Hegel is not historical.
2918300	2921340	So the logic is not about history.
2921340	2923620	The logic is not about historical categories,
2924460	2926620	the development of the logic is not historical or temple.
2926620	2929260	It's eternal outside of time.
2929260	2933980	But Hegel thinks those eternal metaphysical logical
2933980	2938420	structures are realized over time
2938420	2940860	in human history in philosophy.
2941900	2944580	So what the history of philosophy is,
2944580	2948740	is the history of philosophers grasping
2948740	2953420	incompletely mutilated non-systematic parts
2953420	2956540	of the complete systematic self-development
2956540	2958380	of non-physical categories.
2958380	2961740	So once you have Hegel's logic on board,
2961740	2964420	you can then look back through the history of philosophy
2964420	2967820	and see aspects of it manifest themselves
2967820	2971500	in Parmenides, Heraclitus, Plato, Aristotle, et cetera.
2971500	2973340	Hegel is very dismissive of the medieval
2973340	2975180	in his lecture of the history of philosophy.
2975180	2976780	And then there were some medieval.
2976780	2978540	Let's ignore that.
2979260	2980820	Let's start up with Descartes, okay?
2980820	2983620	And really just get to the Germans as quickly as possible.
2985500	2989700	And so Hegel's, we're gonna end the class
2989700	2991260	by reading a little bit of Hegel's lectures
2991260	2992380	on the history of philosophy.
2992380	2995220	Hegel thinks to confirm this theory,
2995220	2997780	you have to go back through the history of philosophy
2997780	3001020	and see this self-developing system
3001020	3004100	of metaphysical structures, which is called the idea.
3004100	3007540	You have to see it present in the history of philosophy,
3007540	3010700	just as you have to see in the history of art,
3010700	3012420	you have to find in the history of art
3012420	3014620	the artistic presentation of the idea,
3014620	3017740	the presentation of the idea in pictures
3017740	3020620	and sculptures and music, et cetera.
3020620	3022820	And you have to find in the history of religion
3022820	3025020	the religious presentation of the idea,
3025020	3028860	the presentation of the idea in mythology,
3028860	3033860	in spiritual practice, in holy scriptures, et cetera.
3033940	3035180	Yeah?
3035220	3037980	What would be the tell-off of history?
3037980	3038820	Of what?
3039820	3040660	Of history?
3040660	3045860	No, of his system, like the ultimate.
3045860	3046700	The short answer is-
3046700	3048660	The historian says the ultimate form,
3048660	3050100	like the perfect open form.
3050100	3052460	Reason fully and entirely grasping,
3052460	3053900	that's all the best reason.
3055140	3056220	Yeah?
3056220	3058300	So when history uses phenomenology-
3058300	3059340	Oh, excellent, yeah, I didn't answer
3059340	3060980	the original question, yeah, thank you.
3060980	3064260	So yeah, so the phenomenology in Hegel
3064260	3069260	is just the science of how science appears,
3071820	3076820	that is to say, shapes of apparent claims
3077180	3079020	to knowledge that are not knowledge.
3079020	3080820	So the science of the experience of consciousness
3080820	3083700	could also be called the phenomenology of knowledge.
3083700	3086780	And the phenomenology of spirit is the logos,
3086780	3089820	the science of how spirit appears to itself
3089820	3091940	as things that are not yet spirit.
3091940	3096820	It's spirit in itself but not yet for itself.
3096820	3101620	It's the scientific exposition of the stages of spirit
3101620	3103380	in itself but not yet for itself
3103380	3105780	up to and including spirit in and for itself.
3107420	3111380	Phenomenology in Husserl is this idea
3111380	3113620	that what first philosophy should be,
3113620	3118500	the replacement for metaphysics should be a science
3118500	3122020	where you just bracket the question
3122020	3123860	of whether the objects of consciousness
3123860	3126340	have any being outside of consciousness,
3126340	3129140	and you study the pure structure of consciousness.
3130540	3134020	Now, Hegel just thinks, okay, that's cool,
3134020	3138780	but we've already, we've seen that movie before.
3138780	3140580	It was called early modern histology.
3142900	3146380	My general view on, so one of the things
3146380	3148220	that's frustrating about the Hegel reception
3148820	3150100	is a lot of people think, oh, you know,
3150100	3152020	Hegel's a dead dog, let's reject Hegel,
3152020	3156180	but the objections to Hegel are largely terrible.
3156180	3157740	And then what's really frustrating
3157740	3159380	is people think they're gonna do this other thing.
3159380	3162460	And it's like, okay, that view is already a sub-model
3162460	3163940	of the phenomenology of spirit.
3163940	3166660	Like, Hegel is fully aware of that as a possibility.
3166660	3168580	He foresaw it and he refuted it.
3168580	3169940	So what are we doing here, guys?
3169940	3171180	What are we doing here?
3172620	3174580	Yeah, someone else, yes.
3175300	3177100	I was gonna say, how would Hegel explain
3177100	3179420	the kind of experience that, like,
3181020	3183500	you just go, like, more and more wrong,
3183500	3186620	for example, like, if I choose the wrong path
3186620	3189780	of argument in an essay, well, I believe that's true.
3189780	3191740	And I just go, like, more and more wrong,
3191740	3193180	like, just the wrong, and.
3194900	3198380	It's logically independent or orthogonal
3198380	3200300	to what Hegel is doing in the phenomenology of spirit.
3200300	3202580	The phenomenology of spirit is not psychology.
3202580	3204940	This is not a claim of a human psychology
3204940	3208180	or what human psychology does in respect,
3208180	3210220	in the face of error.
3210220	3214620	It's a logical claim about the nature of consciousness.
3214620	3217420	So you might not care that you're wrong,
3217420	3219540	but consciousness has such ducts.
3219540	3223040	And that's why, in general, consciousness,
3224420	3226060	when it discovers an incoherence
3226060	3229180	in its own self-conception alters it.
3229180	3230620	And one way of seeing that,
3230660	3232980	although this is not the theme of the phenomenology,
3232980	3236220	is this story is played out in history,
3236220	3238540	but it's not the topic of the phenomenology.
3238540	3240540	The key thing is that in absolute knowing
3240540	3241500	at the end of the book,
3241500	3246000	Hegel says spirit releases itself into history,
3246000	3249080	which means that all of this does happen in history,
3249080	3250900	but it doesn't happen in this order.
3250900	3252860	And that is not the topic of this book.
3252860	3254180	So these shapes of consciousness
3254180	3255900	are historically real.
3255900	3259840	And historically, when human societies recognize
3259880	3261720	that their conception of their relationship
3261720	3263320	to the world is incoherent,
3264600	3266560	they change, not immediately.
3266560	3269360	Sometimes they persist in the contradiction.
3269360	3273960	And then the undoing of that contradiction
3273960	3277020	can involve massive historical change.
3277020	3279180	For instance, my country is founded on the idea
3279180	3281120	that all men are created equal.
3281120	3283680	It was also founded on economic side
3283680	3285400	and the exploitation of enslaved people.
3285400	3286560	That's a contradiction.
3287400	3289720	You can either think of that contradiction
3289720	3291240	as having worked out in the Civil War
3291240	3293480	as we're still not being worked out.
3293480	3296040	But that's a perfect example of a Hegelian contradiction
3296040	3297480	worked out historically.
3297480	3298360	Yeah.
3298360	3300200	Does consciousness know a symbol
3300200	3302600	of becoming spirit in its beginning?
3302600	3303440	No.
3303440	3306640	Or like, so it only goes to my guess.
3307880	3310640	It gets some anticipation later on.
3310640	3313200	Later on, it's like you can see in the distance this thing
3313200	3315280	and it's like, that would be really awesome.
3315320	3317480	Early on, consciousness, as we'll see next week
3317480	3319240	when we talk about the first shape of consciousness,
3319240	3322040	the first shape of consciousness knows one thing.
3322040	3322880	This.
3325120	3327880	What's the grounds of the movement itself?
3327880	3331440	The grounds of the movement itself is the
3334720	3337680	the self-reputation of consciousness.
3337680	3338520	Yeah.
3338520	3341120	What limits consciousness from knowing the being?
3342120	3344520	Nothing.
3344520	3347560	What limits consciousness from knowing the in itself
3347560	3351640	is all of its conceptions of the in itself and knowing
3351640	3354480	short of absolute no.
3354480	3359320	So one way of thinking about the relationship
3359320	3362160	between Hegel and Kant is Kant thinks
3362160	3364600	that at least theoretically things themselves
3364600	3366720	are unavailable to us.
3366720	3369660	Hegel thinks nothing is unavailable to us.
3370060	3372060	There might be facts that are unknowable to us,
3372060	3374300	there might be details of my particular objects,
3374300	3376260	but there's nothing that is structurally
3376260	3378740	or logically unknowable to us.
3378740	3381060	Everything is in principle available
3381060	3382300	or transparent to spirit.
3384940	3387700	Consciousness and science of consciousness
3387700	3389580	both are events?
3389580	3392180	No, because events happen in time.
3392180	3395100	None of these, the phenomenology of spirit
3395100	3397860	is not about any events, it's not about any times.
3397860	3400660	Hegel illustrates various shapes of consciousness
3400660	3402580	with historical references.
3402580	3405180	But people who focus on those things
3405180	3408060	and take the phenomenology to be about them
3408060	3410060	in the words of my friend Marcus Gabriel
3410060	3413180	are expositing Hegel's examples, not Hegel.
3413180	3415300	They are scholars of Hegel's metaphors,
3415300	3416900	not of the phenomenology of spirit.
3416900	3417740	Yeah, in the back.
3417740	3421300	Yes, last section, paragraph 26.
3421300	3425620	There's two instances I, well, we were talking about that
3425620	3427820	in the book, but I'm not going to emphasize
3427820	3430100	how different from a point of decision between science
3430100	3432380	or the knowledge, apparent knowledge,
3432380	3434300	what true knowledge that we declare,
3434300	3438020	because it's like both and I guess not.
3438020	3440060	But like in time, science declares-
3440060	3441700	Just could you just tell me where in some instances?
3441700	3443740	Yeah, science declares its beam to me its power,
3443740	3445900	but I'm sure knowing this as much as fuel
3445900	3449380	to the fact that it is, and it gives out the assurance
3449380	3451740	that science counts as nothing,
3451740	3454500	so what does it mean, the science declares its beam
3455100	3456420	on the standard and-
3456420	3460340	Oh, so the idea is science says I am science.
3460340	3462460	So I know stuff.
3462460	3464420	But the person who doesn't have science,
3464420	3466100	but thinks they have science, can say the same thing.
3466100	3467500	They can give the same little speech,
3467500	3468660	because they both are.
3470700	3471540	Yes.
3472540	3474180	This is for the study of study of the last question,
3474180	3476940	but does Hegel ever provide an explicit justification
3476940	3479700	of how we can be certain that the conditions
3479700	3482860	for this whole progression are all identical to success?
3482860	3486020	How does he know that nature sort of never intervenes
3486020	3487340	in the progression of consciousness,
3487340	3489340	and that can all just sort of contain
3489340	3490620	within consciousness itself?
3490620	3494260	Okay, so that would be a problem if this were a description
3494260	3497300	of a concrete process happening in reality.
3497300	3501260	This is a purely logical or conceptual account.
3501260	3503980	So the word about nature intervening
3503980	3507980	or nature not cooperating is no more a problem
3507980	3510380	than this for a logic textbook.
3510380	3512620	If you said, how do you know that if P
3513260	3516580	then Q, then Q, nature might intervene.
3516580	3519020	Nature might, just at the moment you're concluding
3519020	3522540	that Q of earth, queen, or meteor might happen.
3522540	3523500	That's not a problem here.
3523500	3526820	That might be a problem for Hegel's theory of history.
3526820	3528060	When you get to Hegel's history,
3528060	3530220	Hegel's theory of history might have the problem
3530220	3533780	that well a meteor could come and not wipe out humanity.
3533780	3535460	I don't think it does have that problem,
3535460	3538580	but it is standardly read as having that problem.
3538580	3539420	Yeah.
3539420	3542900	Just from that hour or on science stuff,
3542900	3545220	a word is mentioned in the time that I don't understand,
3545220	3546540	it's the word imitation.
3546540	3547380	What's that?
3547380	3549340	Is that something like a reference to your way
3549340	3551460	of understanding the world?
3551460	3554340	Imitation is just something that pretends
3554340	3556180	to be something that it isn't.
3556180	3560340	So, you know, there's imitation cheese,
3560340	3562260	which is not cheese.
3562260	3564220	It's like made out of non-dairy products.
3564220	3567100	There's imitation crab, which is not crab.
3567100	3568900	It's all of the most repulsive,
3568900	3572820	inedible parts of some fish that's been reformed
3572820	3575180	to make it look like crab and die.
3575180	3576100	What is intimation?
3576100	3577500	Oh, intimation, sorry.
3577500	3578380	Oh, intimation.
3579780	3584360	Yeah, so an intimation is like when you kind of vaguely
3584360	3586620	sense that something is gonna happen,
3586620	3591300	but you can't really say exactly what.
3591300	3593620	So many of you have an intimation
3593620	3594940	that this class is gonna become
3594940	3596700	completely incomprehensible.
3597060	3600220	That's more than an intimation,
3600220	3603580	because I've more or less told you that that's gonna happen.
3603580	3604420	Yeah?
3604420	3605260	I'll ask you a question.
3605260	3608540	What is the word natural at to natural?
3608540	3610140	Good question.
3610140	3612220	I think what it means,
3612220	3617220	I think it's supposed to justify
3618420	3620860	why we start with the shape of consciousness
3620860	3621860	that we've given.
3621860	3624240	Namely, it's the most immediate
3624240	3627040	or least sophisticated possible shape of consciousness.
3628600	3630320	On the other hand, I mean, sorry,
3630320	3632760	I didn't ignore that, that's wrong.
3632760	3635080	What it means by calling that natural consciousness
3635080	3636940	is that that is the position
3636940	3639720	of philosophically untrue to common sense.
3639720	3642580	That's the natural starting point to think about knowledge.
3644160	3646840	I have a being, there's some other beings,
3646840	3648120	they're distinct from me.
3648120	3649280	I've gotta know about them.
3649280	3650200	How do I do that?
3650200	3652000	That leads you into the whole problem.
3653000	3653840	Yeah?
3653840	3658840	So, sorry, I'm trying to find a way to frame the phone.
3660400	3664600	So is there a sort of an original point of,
3664600	3667240	so the being for, the being in itself,
3668200	3670600	it seems to me it's for Hegel.
3670600	3673400	It's already at any rate sort of being schematized
3673400	3675400	already by the consciousness
3675400	3677760	so that it can make its presence into,
3677760	3680680	you know, a relationship in knowing.
3680800	3683800	So, which it's sort of,
3685800	3688000	a schematization is already a sort of,
3689800	3693000	a sort of derivation from the original being in itself.
3695000	3699320	So what you're right about is being in itself here
3699320	3702560	is the in itself of the object of knowledge,
3702560	3703840	or the object of consciousness,
3703840	3705320	which means that the in itself,
3705320	3707440	insofar as we cannot be conscious of it,
3707440	3708920	is not on the table.
3708920	3712800	But remember, the topic here is, what can we know?
3712800	3715440	So the in itself, insofar as we can't be conscious of it,
3715440	3718040	is definitely not a topic for epistemology.
3718040	3721320	Secondly, knowledge here, I just, I keep trying to,
3721320	3723480	knowledge is extremely general.
3723480	3726000	It's what, it is the relationship of consciousness
3726000	3726840	to a topic.
3727800	3730840	So if we can't be conscious of it,
3730840	3733120	this in itself that isn't even,
3733120	3735840	isn't the in itself of the object of consciousness.
3735840	3736680	If the in itself,
3736680	3738440	that can't even be an object of consciousness,
3738520	3740160	how do we even talk about it?
3740160	3741800	So it's just not relevant.
3741800	3745000	So the starting point, the original point of,
3745000	3747000	of dialect is when you take a little movement,
3747000	3749640	it's already in a mode of knowing, sort of.
3749640	3752560	Exactly, it's all of this is within a thought.
3752560	3753920	We're not talking,
3753920	3757560	the phenomena does not start with beings.
3757560	3761040	It starts with the relationship of consciousness to beings.
3761040	3763400	In particular, it starts with the relationship
3763400	3766040	of consciousness to beings as conceived by consciousness.
3766040	3768400	Everything is within a thought.
3768720	3769800	I'll see you next week.
3769800	3771960	And if you have any questions for today,
3771960	3773800	please hand them in and they'll just pick.
3779200	3781800	And if you're auditing, please do not hand in.
3798400	3799240	Okay.
3816760	3819160	You need to stop worrying about the nine digits.
3828400	3833400	Good luck with finishing your application.
3858400	3860400	Actually, yeah, unless I have a copy.
3862920	3864400	So are you a Hegelian now?
3864400	3866200	No, I'm just, I don't know what you're saying.
3866200	3867680	Is there a Kantian?
3867680	3868520	Sorry?
3868520	3869360	I don't even know what he's saying.
3869360	3870200	Hi.
3874200	3876000	If you had to describe your position,
3876000	3878160	last I checked, you were like very into it.
3878160	3879440	I still am.
3879440	3881360	I think about him every day.
3881360	3882680	Okay.
3882680	3885920	Oh, I mean, theoretically, yeah, like.
3885920	3887440	So does that cost?
3888440	3890360	Ancient philosophy.
3890360	3893000	I can also find a classic department.
3893000	3895440	So I assume you also have a wonderful,
3895440	3896720	is there a reason that I was like-
3896720	3901720	No, he only taught me one class and I wasn't too confident.
3903120	3904320	But I got a letter from-
3904320	3905760	I don't understand.
3905760	3907600	You have to not imagine that it's like
3907600	3909040	more difficult than it is.
3909040	3910160	I think my third year-
3910160	3911560	He's just making some point.
3911560	3913040	Am I laughing at it?
3913040	3913880	That's impossible.
3913880	3916040	I feel like I understand that.
3916040	3917600	He's telling you what you already know.
3917600	3919560	Like, you take all the good stuff.
3919560	3921360	He's like, you gotta be a flop person.
3921360	3922200	You gotta know stuff.
3922200	3923040	There's not a lot of flop.
3923040	3923880	There's not a lot of flop.
3923880	3924720	I don't, I don't-
3924720	3925560	Yeah.
3925560	3926400	Yeah.
3926400	3927840	There's no sense to-
3927840	3928680	No, he's not.
3928680	3929880	His ontology's too difficult.
3929880	3931360	He's the easiest person to read.
3931360	3934720	Literally, you just gotta read sentences after something.
3934720	3937320	Yeah, but his ontology's so difficult.
3937320	3938160	He's not.
3938160	3939000	He's literally just telling someone,
3939000	3939840	there's just one thing.
3939840	3940680	There's just one thing.
3940680	3941520	What do you think about Spinoza?
3941520	3942560	Spino- I love Spinoza.
3942560	3943520	We love Spinoza.
3943520	3945480	Everyone should love Spinoza.
3945920	3946760	Yeah.
3946760	3947600	No.
3948800	3949640	I don't understand.
