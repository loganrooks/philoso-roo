00:00.000 --> 00:08.840
is the only possible justification for the logic being

00:08.840 --> 00:13.440
the science of logic being also the science of being.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.440
The self-determining content of thought

00:15.440 --> 00:18.440
is structurally identical to the self-determining content

00:18.440 --> 00:20.960
of being.

00:20.960 --> 00:23.640
And so that's why Hegel says in the Encyclopedia,

00:23.640 --> 00:28.320
paragraph 24, the logic coincides with metaphysics.

00:28.360 --> 00:31.120
They have the same content.

00:31.120 --> 00:36.520
Hegel's just told us that the deduction of that science,

00:36.520 --> 00:40.280
the science that is both logic and metaphysics,

00:40.280 --> 00:42.600
is the phenomenology of spirit itself.

00:42.600 --> 00:47.520
And the phenomenology is, let's see, 500 pages?

00:47.520 --> 00:49.480
500 pages, 466.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.080
So that's a little disappointing,

00:51.080 --> 00:55.200
because if you want to know why the science of logic

00:55.200 --> 00:57.520
is actually a metaphysics, if you

00:57.520 --> 01:00.320
want to see the deduction of this science

01:00.320 --> 01:02.400
and its justification, you need to read

01:02.400 --> 01:03.880
the whole phenomenology of spirit.

01:03.880 --> 01:05.760
And every step in the phenomenology of spirit

01:05.760 --> 01:07.520
needs to work.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.240
But I think there's internal evidence.

01:10.240 --> 01:12.660
That's why I assigned those passages

01:12.660 --> 01:14.160
from the Encyclopedia.

01:14.160 --> 01:17.280
There's internal evidence in the Encyclopedia

01:17.280 --> 01:19.680
that Hegel thinks there's a shorter

01:19.680 --> 01:23.280
argument to that conclusion.

01:23.280 --> 01:26.720
Now, that is to say.

01:26.720 --> 01:30.880
So what is the relationship between these two things?

01:30.880 --> 01:33.000
I'm not sure what the relationship between these two

01:33.000 --> 01:34.280
things is.

01:34.280 --> 01:41.480
I think that the argument that I call the short argument

01:41.480 --> 01:46.480
is sufficient to establish the logic

01:46.480 --> 01:48.500
as being what the science of thinking

01:48.500 --> 01:51.000
and the science of metaphysics, the science of thinking

01:51.000 --> 01:53.720
and the science of being what being.

01:53.720 --> 01:59.360
But it won't repel any possible skepticism

01:59.360 --> 02:03.800
as to whether that is knowing, whether it is science,

02:03.800 --> 02:07.600
and whether it is all that science and knowing could be.

02:07.600 --> 02:09.240
That is to say, if you really want

02:09.240 --> 02:12.480
to press Hegel with skeptical objections

02:12.480 --> 02:15.380
about the possibility of a science of logic

02:15.380 --> 02:20.960
slash metaphysics, the following short argument won't suffice.

02:20.960 --> 02:25.800
So there's a passage in the science of logic

02:25.800 --> 02:30.480
that I think indicates that he has something

02:30.480 --> 02:33.120
like the following short argument in mind.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.440
This is at 2134.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.640
On the other side, one can appeal

02:37.640 --> 02:40.920
to the representations typical of ordinary logic.

02:40.920 --> 02:42.520
For it is assumed that in definitions,

02:42.520 --> 02:44.440
for example, the determinations are not just

02:44.440 --> 02:47.240
of the knowing subject, but are rather determinations

02:47.240 --> 02:50.120
of the subject matter, such that constitutes

02:50.120 --> 02:51.760
in our most essential nature.

02:51.760 --> 02:56.880
So the idea is, just like totally ordinary logic,

02:56.880 --> 02:59.960
we assume that when we define a concept,

02:59.960 --> 03:02.640
we haven't just learned something about our concept.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.020
We've learned something about being.

03:05.020 --> 03:10.560
If I say, let concepts be, that's a bad example,

03:10.560 --> 03:15.120
let a bachelor refer to unmarried males.

03:15.120 --> 03:19.560
We've learned both what the concept bachelor is,

03:19.560 --> 03:23.120
and we've learned what bachelors are.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.320
We've learned something about the world,

03:25.320 --> 03:27.720
and we've learned something about our concepts.

03:27.720 --> 03:29.440
And those are two different facts

03:29.440 --> 03:31.520
under two different modes of description.

03:31.520 --> 03:34.960
It's not possible for those things to come apart.

03:34.960 --> 03:37.640
Now, it might be that our concepts

03:37.640 --> 03:41.160
don't carve reality at instruction.

03:41.160 --> 03:45.200
So merely defining might not get you at the structure.

03:45.200 --> 03:48.120
Might be that, as probably as difficult.

03:48.120 --> 03:51.360
Being is not carved up into bachelors in life.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.560
This is not an ontologically important distinction.

03:54.560 --> 03:59.680
But if you can just do ordinary logic,

03:59.680 --> 04:02.280
you can't really entertain skepticism

04:02.280 --> 04:05.720
about whether ordinary logic is truer.

04:05.720 --> 04:10.080
And that means either you can't do logic in ordinary sense,

04:10.080 --> 04:15.240
or ordinary logic is already a guide to being.

04:15.240 --> 04:18.000
Or in an inference drawn from given determinations

04:18.280 --> 04:20.720
to others, the assumption is that the inferred

04:20.720 --> 04:23.080
is not something external to the subject matter

04:23.080 --> 04:27.280
and alien to it, but that it belongs to it instead.

04:27.280 --> 04:31.680
That to the thought, there corresponds being.

04:31.680 --> 04:34.080
So what Hegel has in mind is just

04:34.080 --> 04:40.160
in doing a totally ordinary inference in what is ordinarily

04:40.160 --> 04:47.080
called logic, you have to presuppose you can't entertain

04:47.080 --> 04:50.640
skepticism about, so to speak, the metaphysical importance

04:50.640 --> 04:51.480
of that claim.

04:51.480 --> 04:57.440
So let's just, as simple as possible inference,

04:57.440 --> 04:59.640
I'm not even sure that Hegel considered this inference.

04:59.640 --> 05:10.240
So let's say P, therefore, either P or Q, this is called.

05:10.240 --> 05:13.400
Not necessarily an inference that logicians

05:13.400 --> 05:15.400
in the ordinary sense would accept in Hegel's input.

05:15.400 --> 05:18.480
So let's just back it up.

05:18.480 --> 05:23.560
Now, if you've accepted this as a valid inference in logic,

05:23.560 --> 05:30.840
you've accepted that if P is true, then P or Q is true.

05:30.840 --> 05:47.440
So you've also accepted that if P, then if P or Q. Now, you can't,

05:47.440 --> 05:51.440
as long as you accept this as a rule of inference in logic,

05:51.440 --> 05:56.960
you have to accept that it preserves truth.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.240
And if you accept that it preserves truth,

05:59.280 --> 06:03.040
you've accepted, essentially, a claim about reality.

06:03.040 --> 06:07.800
Because notice, this doesn't say anything about inference or truth.

06:07.800 --> 06:12.120
This is, so to speak, purely metaphysical.

06:12.120 --> 06:15.280
It just makes a claim about the world.

06:15.280 --> 06:18.680
And this is what we do in logic.

06:18.680 --> 06:26.440
So if you can do this, and this is knowing, if you know this,

06:26.440 --> 06:29.440
then you know some things about the world.

06:29.440 --> 06:31.880
And you know them purely.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.520
So either you're a skeptic about this, and then Hegel thinks,

06:34.520 --> 06:37.800
well, now you can't do any science of anything.

06:37.800 --> 06:40.440
You're a real skeptic.

06:40.440 --> 06:43.840
Because you'll be like, oh, here's just another example.

06:43.840 --> 06:49.920
P and Q, therefore, P and Q. I know Hegel was German,

06:49.920 --> 06:51.200
and I know Kant was German.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.440
But I don't know whether Kant was German and Hegel was German.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.400
Now you've just totally made it impossible for yourself

06:57.400 --> 06:59.480
to do science about anything.

06:59.480 --> 07:03.920
So the idea is, just in accepting ordinary logical

07:03.920 --> 07:07.640
inference as preserving truth, you

07:07.640 --> 07:12.680
are accrediting yourself knowledge of the world.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.480
Because that is actually indirectly knowledge

07:14.480 --> 07:15.080
of the world.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.600
Now, you might think that's really trivial formal knowledge

07:17.600 --> 07:18.680
of the world.

07:18.680 --> 07:21.800
And Hegel will say, that's what you're totally entitled to think

07:21.800 --> 07:23.120
of that until you read my logic.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.640
Because what I'm going to show you

07:24.640 --> 07:27.120
is things even more basic than this develop

07:27.120 --> 07:28.760
really contentful knowledge.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.560
So the idea is this, Hegel wants to get you

07:30.560 --> 07:33.560
on the hook for thinking that there's no, let me just finish,

07:33.560 --> 07:39.640
there's no coherent skepticism about the metaphysical import

07:39.640 --> 07:41.040
of logic.

07:41.040 --> 07:43.760
We can just translate from logical truths

07:43.760 --> 07:45.280
to metaphysical truths, although they're

07:45.280 --> 07:48.200
pretty rinky dinky metaphysical truths so far.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.160
Here's another example.

07:53.200 --> 07:57.120
Can you coherently entertain skepticism

07:57.120 --> 08:00.960
about the law of logic?

08:00.960 --> 08:03.080
There are no true contradictions.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.120
So let's just say the principle of contradiction

08:05.120 --> 08:07.560
is there are no true contradictions.

08:16.120 --> 08:18.120
OK.

08:18.120 --> 08:22.000
Now, if you accept that as a law of logic,

08:22.000 --> 08:25.000
Hegel thinks, you have to accept not merely,

08:25.000 --> 08:27.360
oh, you shouldn't think that there

08:27.360 --> 08:29.200
are any true contradictions.

08:29.200 --> 08:37.640
But there are no contradictory thoughts.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.840
That is to say, anything that's contradictory

08:39.840 --> 08:42.120
isn't actually thinkable.

08:42.120 --> 08:45.160
So the question is, can you entertain the following thought?

08:48.720 --> 08:53.720
There are no contradictory, self-contradictory thoughts.

09:02.640 --> 09:08.000
But maybe the principle of contradiction

09:08.000 --> 09:17.680
is inaccurate about being capitalized.

09:17.680 --> 09:19.920
Is that a coherent thought?

09:19.920 --> 09:21.720
Well, no, Hegel thinks.

09:21.720 --> 09:25.080
Because insofar as you entertain that,

09:25.080 --> 09:35.760
you're entertaining the thought maybe it

09:35.760 --> 09:46.440
is inaccurate to being that there

09:46.440 --> 09:51.200
are no true contradictions.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.000
Well, what's a true contradiction?

10:01.760 --> 10:04.240
It's a contradictory thought.

10:04.240 --> 10:07.840
So to entertain skepticism about the metaphysical import

10:07.840 --> 10:12.600
of the principle of contradiction is self-underbody.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.360
Because you're attempting to hold in your thought.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.920
There are no self-contradictory thoughts.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.800
But maybe there are some true ones.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.160
Now, this presupposes two things.

10:24.160 --> 10:28.600
It presupposes what's called the constitutive conception

10:28.600 --> 10:29.120
of logic.

10:35.240 --> 10:43.160
That is to say, it presupposes that what you find out in logic

10:43.160 --> 10:47.040
is the structure that thoughts have to have.

10:47.040 --> 10:48.800
Not the structure that they ought to have,

10:48.800 --> 10:51.600
but the structure that thoughts as such have.

10:51.600 --> 10:54.800
And that's why it's incoherent to entertain that

10:54.800 --> 10:58.240
and then entertain skepticism of whether it might be some others.

10:58.240 --> 11:02.520
And secondly, the truth is the predicate of thoughts.

11:04.240 --> 11:14.400
Because that's what allowed me to go from there's

11:14.400 --> 11:17.840
true contradictions, there are true contradictory thoughts.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.760
Without that, this argument doesn't work.

11:19.760 --> 11:23.000
Now, this is an oversimplification

11:23.000 --> 11:25.680
because Hegel doesn't really hold this view.

11:25.680 --> 11:29.000
Doesn't really hold the constitutive conception

11:29.000 --> 11:30.320
of logic.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.640
And this is a thing you might think,

11:32.640 --> 11:35.960
maybe Hegel's thought is vulnerable there.

11:35.960 --> 11:39.440
Maybe he's just assuming a certain idealist view.

11:39.440 --> 11:44.480
Namely, that truth is a matter of thought.

11:44.480 --> 11:49.720
But I actually don't think Hegel is vulnerable on that point.

11:49.720 --> 11:52.400
So here's the idea.

11:52.440 --> 12:04.960
The idea is let's see if we can make skepticism

12:04.960 --> 12:08.720
about the metaphysical import of logic coherent

12:08.720 --> 12:12.880
by distancing reality from thought.

12:12.880 --> 12:17.240
We could say, look, there might be contradictions.

12:17.240 --> 12:21.600
It might be the case that P had not P. Even though we have

12:21.600 --> 12:25.520
to think, we can't think that.

12:25.520 --> 12:28.520
There can't be any P and not P thoughts.

12:28.520 --> 12:31.440
So already, you're like, well, what was I doing?

12:31.440 --> 12:37.800
But already, so then, next move, if P and not P is the case,

12:37.800 --> 12:43.680
then isn't it the case that P and not P is true?

12:43.680 --> 12:46.880
So you could reject that.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.280
That's potentially a question.

12:48.280 --> 12:50.440
But then Hegel, I think his question would be,

12:50.480 --> 12:53.520
what are you even talking about?

12:53.520 --> 12:59.560
How could it be the case that this, without it being true?

12:59.560 --> 13:02.280
I think Hegel thinks this is the most trivial thing

13:02.280 --> 13:04.440
in philosophy.

13:04.440 --> 13:09.960
Q if and only if it's true that Q.

13:09.960 --> 13:14.640
The way in which Donald Davidson is a Hegelian.

13:14.640 --> 13:17.440
Although, actually, there was a lecture here years ago

13:17.440 --> 13:23.000
about what kind of idealist is Hegel.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.040
And my objection at one point was, well, if this is right,

13:26.040 --> 13:28.360
then Donald Davidson is an absolute idealist.

13:28.360 --> 13:32.840
And the speaker was like, yes, exactly, Donald Davidson.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.440
That's not right.

13:34.440 --> 13:35.760
Now we're a good friend of mine.

13:35.760 --> 13:38.680
So then the question is, OK.

13:38.680 --> 13:42.320
So that doesn't look, that Hegel looks pretty good then.

13:42.360 --> 13:48.480
The next thing you could say is P and not P is not a thought.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.840
So you might think, OK, look, sure,

13:56.840 --> 14:01.560
we can't think contradictory whatevers.

14:01.560 --> 14:05.840
But truth is not a property of thoughts.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.240
It's a property of something like propositions.

14:12.320 --> 14:22.280
So I just want to know, when Hegel talks about thoughts,

14:22.280 --> 14:26.000
he doesn't mean activities of human spirit.

14:26.000 --> 14:30.040
He means the content of activities of human spirit.

14:30.040 --> 14:36.880
So thought in Hegel, pedanka, is something

14:36.880 --> 14:43.440
like a content of thought in the psychological sense.

14:50.840 --> 14:53.160
So then I want to know, what does this person

14:53.160 --> 14:56.520
mean by a proposition if they don't mean a content of thought?

14:59.320 --> 15:01.840
And if they really mean, oh, the propositions

15:01.840 --> 15:03.840
are not contents of thoughts, then I

15:03.840 --> 15:06.360
have no idea what they're talking about.

15:06.360 --> 15:09.440
And I'm not sure that they know what they're talking about.

15:09.440 --> 15:14.560
So finally, the final source of possible skepticism

15:14.560 --> 15:18.360
about this argument is you might say, oh,

15:18.360 --> 15:22.120
but logic isn't about propositions.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.280
It's just about our thinking.

15:24.280 --> 15:29.800
But then you've saved logic from having

15:29.800 --> 15:33.720
any metaphysical import by making it purely psychological.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.520
It's just about our psychological activities

15:35.560 --> 15:37.960
rather than its content.

15:37.960 --> 15:41.520
So the Hegelian point is there's no pathway

15:41.520 --> 15:45.480
once you accept that we do logic in the ordinary sense,

15:45.480 --> 15:48.600
without which there's no science of anything.

15:48.600 --> 15:52.600
And once you've accepted that logic is not just psychology,

15:52.600 --> 15:55.920
not about the psychological activity of thought

15:55.920 --> 15:59.440
that happens in space and time, so the content of thought,

15:59.440 --> 16:04.480
then you're on the hook for the metaphysical import of logic.

16:04.480 --> 16:08.160
So that's the short argument to the conclusion

16:08.160 --> 16:13.320
that if we can determine non-trivial facts

16:13.320 --> 16:19.000
about the content of thinking as such, any thinking as such,

16:19.000 --> 16:22.240
we will have determined non-trivial facts

16:22.240 --> 16:25.160
about the structure of being.

16:25.160 --> 16:29.040
That is to say, we can go from logic to medical.

16:29.040 --> 16:32.440
Now, this by itself isn't that interesting

16:32.440 --> 16:37.480
if all it gets to you is trivial logical truth.

16:37.480 --> 16:46.720
Very few people would deny that the tautologies

16:46.720 --> 16:49.600
of predicate logic, or tautologies

16:49.600 --> 16:53.360
of propositional logic, are metaphysically necessary.

16:56.400 --> 16:59.120
The Hegelian, what makes this more interesting

16:59.120 --> 17:04.120
is Hegel is going to argue that the structure according

17:04.120 --> 17:06.440
to which thought just as such has to think

17:06.440 --> 17:10.520
is significantly richer and more contentful than just

17:10.520 --> 17:13.280
the tautologies of propositional logic, much less

17:13.280 --> 17:15.400
the tautologies of Aristotelian logic, which are just

17:15.400 --> 17:18.880
like the principle contradiction.

17:18.880 --> 17:22.560
This is the stuff that I went over last time

17:22.560 --> 17:24.960
in a little bit more detail than I went over last.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.040
So here's another thing.

17:27.040 --> 17:31.120
Hegel fundamentally doesn't think of logic in terms of laws.

17:31.120 --> 17:35.640
So we now think of logic as the laws of what is true.

17:35.640 --> 17:37.560
What follows from what?

17:37.560 --> 17:39.220
And then there are some trivial things

17:39.220 --> 17:41.440
that follow from no assumptions whatsoever,

17:41.440 --> 17:43.120
and they're just true.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.160
Those are the laws of logic.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.120
Hegel doesn't really think in those terms.

17:47.120 --> 17:51.560
The logic is much more about determinant thought content.

17:51.560 --> 17:54.880
So we can replace this and make it

17:54.880 --> 17:59.360
a more Hegelian-friendly point if we say not

17:59.360 --> 18:02.520
that which is not self-contradictory thoughts,

18:02.520 --> 18:14.520
but something like there are no thoughts that are not

18:14.520 --> 18:17.800
f not f determinant.

18:17.800 --> 18:29.240
That is to say, f not f marks a joint in logic,

18:29.240 --> 18:32.080
where every thought has to be determinately

18:32.080 --> 18:34.720
on some side of that.

18:34.720 --> 18:36.520
Or another example would be, there

18:36.520 --> 18:42.440
are no thoughts that are not subject predicate thoughts.

18:42.440 --> 18:54.640
But maybe it is inaccurate to being because there

18:54.640 --> 19:11.960
are true thoughts that are not f not f determinant

19:11.960 --> 19:15.320
or, for example, not subject predicate judgments.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.360
So that's more the level at which Hegel is thinking about it.

19:21.360 --> 19:24.180
Once you've accepted that all thought as such

19:24.180 --> 19:28.120
has a certain structure, you cannot then

19:28.120 --> 19:30.040
play the skeptic and be like, but maybe

19:30.040 --> 19:32.320
being self-structured like that, because that

19:32.320 --> 19:37.560
is pretending to think that all thought

19:37.560 --> 19:41.200
is structured a certain way, but certain thoughts that

19:41.200 --> 19:44.360
are not structured that way are true or accurate

19:44.360 --> 19:45.440
to the structure of each.

19:45.440 --> 19:47.640
So at any point in the logic, you're like,

19:47.640 --> 19:49.140
OK, maybe I have to think this way,

19:49.140 --> 19:51.480
but why is being structured that way?

19:51.480 --> 19:53.200
Just reapply this argument.

19:53.200 --> 19:56.240
And if the argument of the logic has succeeded,

19:56.240 --> 20:00.280
that whatever thought structure you're dealing with in the logic

20:00.280 --> 20:02.840
has been imminently derived in such a way

20:02.840 --> 20:07.000
that there's no way of doing without that.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.520
These are not contingent thought contacts

20:11.520 --> 20:14.960
that you can think according to or not as you wish.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.400
They are the structure that thought just as such has to do.

20:17.400 --> 20:17.920
Yeah.

20:17.920 --> 20:21.920
When he says there are no thoughts, such and such,

20:21.920 --> 20:23.120
what does there are means?

20:23.120 --> 20:25.840
If it means that we just were incapable of taking

20:25.840 --> 20:27.840
the thoughts, then that's to reduce the effect

20:27.840 --> 20:29.640
of the sidewalk from the logic.

20:29.640 --> 20:31.800
And if it means there aren't thoughts out there

20:31.800 --> 20:33.120
in this problem, or one of them that

20:33.120 --> 20:35.280
is already assuming some sort of sense of imperialism,

20:35.280 --> 20:39.600
so it's kind of making questions of where you are.

20:39.600 --> 20:40.800
OK, good.

20:40.800 --> 20:56.400
How about thought as such cannot but think fill in the blank?

20:56.400 --> 20:59.480
So then, what is a thought contact?

20:59.480 --> 21:01.800
Something that thought as such can think,

21:01.800 --> 21:04.200
not making any claims of a human thinking.

21:04.200 --> 21:07.040
And if it's possible and logic to prove that thought just

21:07.040 --> 21:08.880
as such has to think in certain ways,

21:08.880 --> 21:11.400
then we're off to the risk.

21:11.400 --> 21:12.400
OK, yeah?

21:12.400 --> 21:15.360
Very simple question because I'm very confused.

21:15.360 --> 21:19.800
So my mental activity, my psychological activity

21:19.800 --> 21:24.280
of thinking in the normal sense, thinking there exists an exercise

21:24.280 --> 21:26.640
that I'd be able to not recognize,

21:26.640 --> 21:30.040
is that not the general decision that people recorded?

21:30.040 --> 21:31.080
OK, yeah.

21:31.080 --> 21:34.680
So your question puts, you're putting your finger

21:34.680 --> 21:37.560
on the question, what is the relationship

21:37.560 --> 21:41.120
between human thinking, an activity that

21:41.120 --> 21:44.240
occurs in space and time, in particular

21:44.240 --> 21:48.440
datable historical moment, have to think it

21:48.440 --> 21:51.240
as the topic of the logic?

21:51.240 --> 21:54.000
And that is not treated in the logic.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.720
That is a thing that at some point in the system,

21:56.720 --> 21:59.280
we have to figure that out.

21:59.280 --> 22:01.480
We have to ask ourselves, at some point in the system,

22:01.480 --> 22:05.080
wait, how do I fit into this?

22:05.080 --> 22:06.640
I'm just a guy in Germany.

22:09.640 --> 22:10.280
I'm finite.

22:13.120 --> 22:15.960
I think sometimes I don't always think,

22:15.960 --> 22:18.600
I haven't been thinking forever, I'm not going to think forever.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.240
What is the relationship between thinking

22:20.240 --> 22:24.800
in the psychological sense to thinking in the logical sense?

22:24.800 --> 22:27.840
And that, of course, that's not just a question for Hegel.

22:27.840 --> 22:30.480
That's a question for everyone who

22:30.480 --> 22:32.880
is not the worst form of psychologist about logic.

22:35.800 --> 22:40.560
What is the relationship between logic and psychology?

22:40.560 --> 22:42.480
Or what is the bearing of logic on thinking

22:42.480 --> 22:44.200
in the psychological sense?

22:44.200 --> 22:48.320
And so if Hegel's system works out properly,

22:48.320 --> 22:50.480
we're going to derive.

22:50.480 --> 22:52.160
We don't yet have in science thinking

22:52.160 --> 22:55.440
in the psychological sense as a topic.

22:55.440 --> 22:57.400
So we have to derive that in science.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.880
There's no who in the logic.

23:01.880 --> 23:06.000
My view of it, your question is, who is thinking the logic?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.960
Who is the subject of the thought of the logic?

23:08.960 --> 23:11.360
Is this the thing that people have different views about?

23:11.360 --> 23:16.400
My view is, that is not a topic of the logic.

23:16.400 --> 23:21.760
That is to say, in logic, we ignore the identity

23:21.760 --> 23:24.560
of the subject of thinking.

23:24.560 --> 23:29.640
As we do in normal logic, take a logic class.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.040
We now call them propositions.

23:31.040 --> 23:33.240
But they're just contents of thinking.

23:33.240 --> 23:36.000
If you then ask, well, what's the relationship

23:36.000 --> 23:37.360
of this to my psychology?

23:37.360 --> 23:39.720
Your logic teacher will say, this is not what we're doing.

23:39.720 --> 23:42.160
I probably assume it's universal thinking.

23:42.160 --> 23:45.520
But find me the logic textbook that

23:45.520 --> 23:49.600
wasn't written in Germany in the 19th century that says,

23:49.600 --> 23:51.400
intro logic.

23:51.400 --> 23:56.440
The topic of this book is universal thinking.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.900
Interestingly, there is one 19th century German

23:58.900 --> 24:00.360
logician who says this.

24:00.360 --> 24:02.120
And it's Frege.

24:02.120 --> 24:17.080
In Der Gedanken, which is one of three essays

24:17.080 --> 24:19.120
called The Logical Investigations that Frege

24:19.120 --> 24:23.600
published late in life after Bertrand Russell had located

24:23.600 --> 24:28.840
a paradox in and thus destroyed his Frege's life work, who

24:28.840 --> 24:31.160
means that's the basic laws of arithmetic.

24:31.160 --> 24:32.760
Frege wrote these three essays trying

24:32.760 --> 24:37.240
to shore up what remained of his life's work in logic.

24:37.240 --> 24:41.800
The thought, or thought, is the most interesting of them.

24:41.800 --> 24:47.640
And he says in that essay that logic is not the study of minds

24:47.720 --> 24:50.040
but of the mind.

24:50.040 --> 24:54.520
This is a question that is not just about the mind.

24:54.520 --> 24:58.280
So Frege, who's supposed to be and is

24:58.280 --> 25:02.600
presented as the godfather of good analytic,

25:02.600 --> 25:06.080
non-psychologistic logic as opposed to all this German

25:06.080 --> 25:10.400
idealist bullshit, in one of the key documents,

25:10.400 --> 25:15.720
says that logic is the science of the spirit, of spirit.

25:15.720 --> 25:18.360
Not of spirits, but of the spirit.

25:18.360 --> 25:24.440
That's a more psychologistic conception of logic than a godfather.

25:24.440 --> 25:27.560
So that's another class that I'll someday teach.

25:27.560 --> 25:32.480
Frege as bad German idealist.

25:32.480 --> 25:37.120
Or why analytic philosophy is, in the Marxist sense,

25:37.120 --> 25:40.840
a deviation of German idealism.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.320
OK.

25:42.320 --> 25:44.320
And then I'll be assassinated by you, Mr. Gritty.

25:44.320 --> 25:47.800
OK.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.600
So I just want to emphasize a few things,

25:50.600 --> 25:51.960
because these are things that I'm

25:51.960 --> 25:55.640
worried that you might get the wrong impression about.

25:55.640 --> 26:01.240
One, logic is not about thinking in the psychological sense.

26:01.240 --> 26:05.120
It's not about the activity of human beings thinking.

26:05.120 --> 26:09.280
It's about what thinking just as such has to think.

26:09.280 --> 26:12.560
It's about the content of thinking as such.

26:12.560 --> 26:15.600
Hegel, unfortunately, just uses the word thought for that.

26:15.600 --> 26:19.720
Now, that thought has this bad ambiguity.

26:19.720 --> 26:24.440
It can be both Nick Stang's thought

26:24.440 --> 26:26.960
and what Nick Stang thinks.

26:26.960 --> 26:29.360
It's only the second sense in which we're interested,

26:29.360 --> 26:33.920
the sense in which my thought can be exactly the same as yours.

26:33.920 --> 26:37.080
And we're not interested in the identity of who

26:37.080 --> 26:38.680
or what thinks these thoughts.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.720
Yeah.

26:40.720 --> 26:46.280
So that means, as Hegel says, page three of the handout,

26:46.280 --> 26:49.520
instead of using the expression thoughts,

26:49.520 --> 26:52.720
it would thus be better to speak of thought determinations

26:52.720 --> 26:55.880
and to avoid any misunderstandings.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.800
So what does that mean?

26:57.800 --> 27:01.520
It means that in logic, we study the content of thought.

27:01.520 --> 27:04.680
So what we study is what makes a thought

27:04.680 --> 27:08.200
determinantly the thought it is, namely its content.

27:08.200 --> 27:10.960
Or thoughts are individuated.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.000
They are what they are in virtue of their content,

27:13.000 --> 27:15.880
because what they are is thought content.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.000
Now, he's not saying that everything thinks

27:18.000 --> 27:19.760
or that everything is a thought.

27:19.760 --> 27:21.280
The identity of being and thinking

27:21.280 --> 27:24.080
must, however, not be taken in a concrete sense.

27:24.080 --> 27:27.080
Hence, what is not to say that a stone that has being

27:27.080 --> 27:29.320
is the same as a thinking human being.

27:29.320 --> 27:32.480
He's not saying that a stone is a thought.

27:32.480 --> 27:38.040
He's saying is there might be stones that we can never,

27:38.040 --> 27:40.280
there's going to be facts about stones that human beings can

27:40.280 --> 27:42.080
never know.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.560
There might be physical objects that

27:43.560 --> 27:45.400
are too distant for us to experience.

27:45.400 --> 27:47.760
There may be physical objects that are too far in the past

27:47.760 --> 27:49.640
for us to know about.

27:49.640 --> 27:54.560
But nothing in being can be logically alien to us.

27:54.560 --> 27:58.200
Everything has the structure of thought.

27:58.200 --> 27:59.480
And since the structure of thought

27:59.480 --> 28:04.360
is not these trivial, tautologous things,

28:04.360 --> 28:05.920
like the principle of contradiction,

28:05.920 --> 28:08.760
it's the very determinate, contentful structure

28:08.760 --> 28:11.640
of the logic that is a metaphysics worth calling

28:11.640 --> 28:13.560
the end.

28:13.560 --> 28:17.080
So this science of just the content of what thought

28:17.080 --> 28:21.080
as such as to think will also be the science of being just

28:21.080 --> 28:23.520
as being or being or being the traditional definition

28:23.520 --> 28:26.120
of metaphysics.

28:26.120 --> 28:30.560
Now, everything that we do is a modification of thinking.

28:30.560 --> 28:34.800
So willing is thinking about what to do or what is good,

28:34.800 --> 28:36.360
what is choice worth.

28:36.360 --> 28:41.120
Desiring also is thinking about what you want.

28:41.120 --> 28:44.600
Perceiving is seeing what is the case.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.720
The content of your perception is also

28:46.720 --> 28:47.920
the content of a thought.

28:47.920 --> 28:54.760
You see that the book is on the table.

28:54.760 --> 29:01.520
Hegel thinks that the marker of thought content is is, is being.

29:01.520 --> 29:03.920
So we don't just see objects.

29:03.920 --> 29:06.680
We see that things are the case.

29:06.680 --> 29:12.200
And so the content of perception is also the content of thought.

29:12.200 --> 29:15.040
Thinking can appear to be just one capacity

29:15.040 --> 29:17.640
of one kind of animals.

29:17.640 --> 29:19.760
That's thinking in the psychological sense.

29:19.760 --> 29:22.440
But it can't be just that.

29:22.440 --> 29:27.240
If it were just that, if it were like human vision,

29:27.240 --> 29:30.240
then the following we'd be coherent.

29:30.240 --> 29:33.000
There is an object that we can think about.

29:33.000 --> 29:34.760
There are objects that we can think about.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.200
And there are objects we cannot think about.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.680
Just as there are objects we can see

29:38.680 --> 29:40.520
and there are objects we cannot see.

29:40.520 --> 29:44.960
Or in Aristotelian terms, thought cannot be an organ.

29:44.960 --> 29:47.520
Can't be one capacity among others

29:47.520 --> 29:52.880
that has one characteristic object over others.

29:52.880 --> 29:58.160
Anything that can be is the, and that

29:58.160 --> 30:00.480
means that thinkable is transcendental,

30:00.480 --> 30:04.040
not in the Kantian sense, but in the original sense

30:04.040 --> 30:09.320
in which unity, truth, and goodness are transcendental.

30:09.320 --> 30:12.560
This is traditional doctrine that all beings are one, true,

30:12.560 --> 30:14.080
and good.

30:14.080 --> 30:17.040
That oneness, truth, and goodness are

30:17.040 --> 30:20.280
constitutive of any being.

30:20.280 --> 30:22.400
And they're interconverted.

30:22.400 --> 30:25.640
Thought is transcendental in something like that sense.

30:25.640 --> 30:28.480
All beings just as such are thinkable,

30:28.480 --> 30:29.960
and all thought is about being.

30:32.680 --> 30:37.720
That's why the purported claim, or one

30:37.720 --> 30:40.320
way to get at that point about the transcendental character

30:40.320 --> 30:43.040
of thought is the claim there is something that cannot be

30:43.040 --> 30:45.440
thought is self-undermining.

30:45.440 --> 30:47.360
So if we think of the development

30:47.360 --> 30:50.480
of transcendental philosophy after Kant

30:50.480 --> 30:56.280
as trying to find a master notion such

30:56.280 --> 30:58.000
that what we do in philosophy is we

30:58.000 --> 31:00.520
study how that is possible.

31:00.520 --> 31:03.200
And then there's nothing outside of that.

31:03.200 --> 31:07.600
We can think, OK, in Kant in some way it's representation,

31:07.600 --> 31:10.280
but representation is too broad.

31:10.280 --> 31:12.240
It can't be cognition, because in Kant

31:12.240 --> 31:13.480
there are things we can represent

31:13.480 --> 31:16.680
that we can't cognize, et cetera, et cetera.

31:16.680 --> 31:22.400
There are other possible candidates for the notion.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.120
Some of them aren't going to work.

31:24.120 --> 31:29.560
Like, for instance, Robert Pippin in his most recent book,

31:29.560 --> 31:33.520
The Culmination, which is about Heidegger in relation

31:33.520 --> 31:37.720
to German idealism, thinks Heidegger wins

31:37.720 --> 31:40.520
because the thing that philosophy should really

31:40.520 --> 31:43.000
be about is meaningfulness.

31:43.000 --> 31:45.000
The Deutschland.

31:45.080 --> 31:49.480
There's the small problem that that's not what being is.

31:49.480 --> 31:51.760
All that taric decay makes that point.

31:51.760 --> 31:54.160
But Beidouitzamkite, meaningfulness,

31:54.160 --> 31:58.920
is not a plausible candidate for our fundamental access

31:58.920 --> 32:00.800
to everything, because the following

32:00.800 --> 32:02.920
is perfectly coherent.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.120
There are things that are not meaningful to me.

32:07.960 --> 32:11.640
So there's something beyond the realm of Beidouitzamkite.

32:11.640 --> 32:16.200
So if we want to study the fundamental way in which

32:16.200 --> 32:20.280
human beings are onto something, or about stuff,

32:20.280 --> 32:24.960
or represent things, use Kantian terminology,

32:24.960 --> 32:27.400
that which is meaningful to us is not a good starting point.

32:27.400 --> 32:29.920
Because we can obviously be onto or intentionally

32:29.920 --> 32:33.160
relate or represent or think about things that

32:33.160 --> 32:35.120
are not meaningful to us.

32:35.120 --> 32:39.160
There's a lot of stuff that's completely meaningless to me.

32:39.160 --> 32:40.720
That sounded dark.

32:40.720 --> 32:47.000
Whoops, like formal epistemology.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.600
Completely devoid of Beidouitzamkite, but it has been.

32:50.600 --> 32:54.400
The following, however, is self-underbinder.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.120
There is something I cannot think about.

32:57.120 --> 33:00.080
That means that a plausible case can

33:00.080 --> 33:03.480
be made for why the fundamental notion

33:03.480 --> 33:07.480
in transcendental philosophy, the thing that properly

33:07.480 --> 33:12.400
describes human-mindedness relationship to anything

33:12.400 --> 33:19.280
that it can be onto, is not meaningfulness but thinking.

33:19.280 --> 33:20.160
OK.

33:20.160 --> 33:23.480
Now thinking as the activation of a capacity in human beings

33:23.480 --> 33:27.120
does not create, generate, et cetera, being.

33:27.120 --> 33:30.880
It's not that being is a product of human thinking.

33:30.880 --> 33:33.040
It's that any more than human thinking

33:33.040 --> 33:35.840
is the product of the laws of logic.

33:35.840 --> 33:38.520
It's that there's no thinkable distinction

33:38.520 --> 33:42.200
between the structure of the content of thinking as such

33:42.200 --> 33:44.400
and the structure of being.

33:44.400 --> 33:44.920
OK.

33:44.920 --> 33:46.920
Let me just, the first thing, the next thing

33:46.920 --> 33:54.960
I'll go over very quickly is what Kantian logic does,

33:54.960 --> 33:57.600
Hegelian logic correspond to.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.760
In some sense, it's neither of them

33:59.760 --> 34:02.600
because it isn't about a capacity or any capacities

34:02.600 --> 34:05.320
of human mind.

34:05.320 --> 34:09.400
On the one hand, it's more like transcendental logic

34:09.400 --> 34:14.000
because it's about the content above.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.640
But on the other hand, it's also more like pure general logic

34:17.640 --> 34:19.800
because it's about the form of thinking.

34:19.800 --> 34:22.600
But really, it's neither slash both of them

34:22.600 --> 34:25.520
because in studying a form of thinking,

34:25.520 --> 34:28.880
you also uncover all of its content.

34:28.880 --> 34:31.520
So something like pure general logic and transcendental logic

34:31.520 --> 34:34.640
become kind of the same for Hegel with the proviso

34:34.640 --> 34:37.160
that they don't become the same because the content of thought

34:37.160 --> 34:39.000
is provided by sensibility.

34:39.000 --> 34:42.680
And this one logic, which is both transcendental and pure

34:42.680 --> 34:47.600
general, is not about any capacities of the human mind.

34:47.600 --> 34:48.440
OK.

34:48.440 --> 34:52.560
Now furthermore, so the thing in Kant that most closely

34:52.560 --> 35:00.400
corresponds to Hegelian logic is the metaphysical deduction

35:00.400 --> 35:05.600
with the proviso that Hegel thinks of his deduction

35:05.600 --> 35:10.640
of the categories of thought as more systematic or imminent than Kant's.

35:10.640 --> 35:12.360
And there's no separation.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.800
We don't first deduce all of the predidational forms of judgment

35:15.800 --> 35:17.840
and then deduce the categories of thought.

35:17.840 --> 35:21.000
The categories themselves are also predication forms.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.640
So the first category of logic is being.

35:23.640 --> 35:26.920
That's also the most basic form of predication is.

35:26.920 --> 35:29.520
As we'll see next week, it's prior even to the distinction

35:29.520 --> 35:32.080
between subject and predicate.

35:32.080 --> 35:38.640
So each of the categories of the logic is also a kind of predication.

35:38.640 --> 35:40.720
OK.

35:40.720 --> 35:43.840
Skip the historical background.

35:43.840 --> 35:47.280
A lot of this is not particularly important.

35:47.280 --> 35:47.960
OK.

35:47.960 --> 35:50.680
I'm going to skip the stuff about method

35:50.680 --> 35:53.360
because it will come back in a couple of weeks.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.360
OK.

35:54.360 --> 36:08.240
So dialectic, remember, is originally in ancient philosophy

36:08.240 --> 36:12.760
or in ancient philosophical practice the art of reputation.

36:12.760 --> 36:17.840
It's how you, as they say on YouTube, destroy people.

36:17.840 --> 36:22.080
That's all the YouTube videos of like Ben Shapiro destroys liberal.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.080
That's all dialectic.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.760
The worst possible dialectic, although Ben Shapiro

36:26.760 --> 36:31.360
has an undergraduate degree in philosophy, I believe,

36:31.360 --> 36:36.800
his parents should get a tuition, a reimbursement.

36:36.800 --> 36:37.440
OK.

36:37.440 --> 36:39.440
I mean, whatever, he's a sophist.

36:39.440 --> 36:41.600
Sorry, I don't want to pick on Ben Shapiro.

36:41.600 --> 36:45.280
Most so-called public intellectuals, most of public intellectual life

36:45.280 --> 36:47.280
is just sophistry.

36:47.280 --> 36:52.720
It's just using rhetorical skills to make the weaker argument to be stronger.

36:52.720 --> 36:58.280
If you haven't figured this out already, this is some good news.

36:58.280 --> 37:02.240
A philosophy education is the best possible education in sophistry.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.440
We're not teaching you how to be sophists,

37:04.440 --> 37:09.280
but we've given you all the skills necessary for maximal sophistry.

37:09.280 --> 37:12.080
You've already probably figured this out.

37:12.080 --> 37:13.840
Just with a little philosophical training,

37:13.840 --> 37:17.080
you can win any argument with your friends

37:17.080 --> 37:21.040
about things you know nothing about because you know as a philosopher,

37:21.040 --> 37:24.520
you just immediately move the terrain onto something

37:24.520 --> 37:27.000
where knowledge doesn't matter.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.600
And then the classic philosophy move is to be like, well,

37:29.600 --> 37:31.680
I don't know what that means.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.960
And now what you've done is you just all their knowledge

37:33.960 --> 37:37.480
has now been made irrelevant because they actually know what it means.

37:37.480 --> 37:39.600
And you're like, I don't know.

37:39.600 --> 37:44.840
So this is also why philosophy is the best possible preparation for law

37:44.840 --> 37:46.760
school.

37:46.760 --> 37:50.920
So you have all the skills necessary to be a really, really successful

37:50.960 --> 37:52.680
YouTube sophist.

37:52.680 --> 37:56.800
I hope you don't do that with your philosophy training.

37:56.800 --> 37:59.080
So that's what dialectic is originally.

38:03.640 --> 38:07.080
Hegel praises Kant's transcendental dialect.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.080
In particular, the Antinomies, he doesn't really

38:09.080 --> 38:10.280
care about the rest of the dialectic.

38:10.280 --> 38:12.360
He always identifies the dialect with the Antinomies.

38:12.360 --> 38:15.040
Because what Kant discovered is that there's

38:15.040 --> 38:19.280
a dialectic built into reason itself.

38:19.280 --> 38:23.280
That is to say, reason itself generates these contradictions.

38:23.280 --> 38:31.680
The problem is that Kant was too freaked out by his own discovery

38:31.680 --> 38:34.320
and thought, oh, what that shows is we better not

38:34.320 --> 38:37.480
try to cognize the unconditioned in things

38:37.480 --> 38:39.320
themselves using the categories.

38:39.320 --> 38:40.960
Instead, what he should have realized

38:40.960 --> 38:44.720
is that the categories in their fixed determinant relationships

38:44.720 --> 38:47.720
to one another generate contradictions.

38:47.720 --> 38:52.480
That's the dialectic of the categories themselves.

38:52.480 --> 38:57.960
Just those concepts themselves dialectically undermine themselves.

38:57.960 --> 39:02.800
Now, Hegel's conception of dialectic is not,

39:02.800 --> 39:06.080
as we saw in the phenomenology, is not just negative.

39:06.080 --> 39:09.640
It's not just that some set of categories

39:09.640 --> 39:12.600
generate contradictions and therefore undermine themselves.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.560
It also generates, it's also positive, it's also generated.

39:16.560 --> 39:19.360
It generates new categories.

39:19.360 --> 39:22.760
And Hegel's name for this kind of philosophy

39:22.760 --> 39:27.560
or this kind of logic, which works by uncovering,

39:27.560 --> 39:30.920
makes it sound like we're doing something.

39:30.920 --> 39:33.720
But I'm going to say it anyways.

39:33.720 --> 39:37.000
Uncovering contradictions or letting concepts contradict

39:37.000 --> 39:42.800
themselves and then resolve that contradict in a higher concept

39:42.800 --> 39:44.280
is he calls that speculative.

39:47.320 --> 39:53.480
So another way of putting that is Hegel's logic is speculative.

39:53.480 --> 39:58.280
That doesn't mean it's speculative in the way of like,

39:58.280 --> 40:01.880
we don't have really good evidence for what happens

40:01.880 --> 40:04.960
10 to the minus seconds after the Big Bang,

40:04.960 --> 40:06.560
but this kind of seems right.

40:06.560 --> 40:08.840
It's not tentative.

40:08.840 --> 40:13.680
It works by thought context and contradicting themselves

40:13.680 --> 40:18.840
and something resolving that contradiction.

40:18.840 --> 40:21.040
It is in this dialectic as understood here,

40:21.040 --> 40:23.720
and hence in grasping opposites in their unity

40:23.720 --> 40:28.080
or the positive in the negative that the speculative consists.

40:28.080 --> 40:32.600
So that's a foreshadowing of the nature of the contradictions

40:32.600 --> 40:35.920
that will arise in the logic.

40:35.920 --> 40:37.360
The nature of the contradictions that

40:37.360 --> 40:42.960
will arise in the logic is you have two categories that

40:42.960 --> 40:46.000
are defined, or what they are, they're

40:46.000 --> 40:55.280
determinately what they are through their difference

40:55.280 --> 40:56.600
from one another.

40:56.600 --> 40:59.880
One category in the marriage.

40:59.880 --> 41:02.680
This is the negation of C1.

41:02.680 --> 41:05.760
This is the negation of C2.

41:05.840 --> 41:11.280
But it will also prove to be the case that they are the same.

41:11.280 --> 41:14.880
So I have categories that are defined through their difference

41:14.880 --> 41:16.760
like one and many, and then we'll

41:16.760 --> 41:19.760
turn out that the one is many and the many is one.

41:19.760 --> 41:22.760
That's a contradiction.

41:22.760 --> 41:26.720
Now the hard thing will be to see how you resolve that,

41:26.720 --> 41:29.400
because it can't be us being like, oh, I

41:29.400 --> 41:31.120
have an idea how to resolve that.

41:31.120 --> 41:32.120
That would be external.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.160
It would be insufficiently imminent.

41:34.160 --> 41:37.760
Somehow the contradiction has to resolve itself,

41:37.760 --> 41:39.880
or just the thought contents themselves

41:39.880 --> 41:41.720
have to resolve the contradiction that they

41:41.720 --> 41:42.640
themselves are.

41:47.280 --> 41:53.000
So as Hegel says, it is thinking that causes the wound

41:53.000 --> 41:54.800
and heals it too.

41:54.800 --> 42:00.920
So thinking causes its own contradictions and resolves it.

42:00.920 --> 42:02.840
But while going about its business,

42:02.840 --> 42:04.960
it so happens that thinking becomes

42:04.960 --> 42:07.360
entangled in contradictions.

42:07.360 --> 42:11.920
It loses itself in the fixed non-identity of its thoughts.

42:11.920 --> 42:12.720
That's what this.

42:12.720 --> 42:15.800
These things are what they are because of what they are not.

42:18.800 --> 42:20.960
It loses itself in the fixed non-identity of its thoughts

42:20.960 --> 42:22.800
and in the process does not attain itself,

42:22.800 --> 42:25.080
but instead remains caught up in its opposite.

42:25.080 --> 42:26.520
The higher aspiration of thinking

42:26.520 --> 42:29.160
goes against this result produced by thinking satisfied

42:29.160 --> 42:31.240
with merely understanding.

42:31.240 --> 42:35.240
So this structure, where a concept is what

42:35.240 --> 42:38.200
it is through its negative relationship to something else,

42:38.200 --> 42:41.600
is what Hegel identifies as the understanding.

42:46.360 --> 42:58.000
Now, he, along with Kant, he acknowledges a difference

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
between understanding and reason.

43:01.480 --> 43:13.800
But he thinks Kantian reason, Kantian fernund,

43:13.800 --> 43:18.440
is also locked at this level.

43:18.440 --> 43:24.240
Because Kantian reason just seeks conditions

43:24.240 --> 43:27.840
for given conditioned objects where those conditioning

43:27.840 --> 43:30.880
relations are defined through the categories, which

43:31.000 --> 43:36.960
are themselves fixed in determinant identity.

43:36.960 --> 43:39.600
So this is all Kantian.

43:39.600 --> 43:44.520
This is all what Hegel would call understanding

43:44.520 --> 43:46.760
or what Kant would call reason, including

43:46.760 --> 43:48.760
what Kant would call understanding.

43:53.560 --> 43:57.840
Or another way of putting this is

43:57.840 --> 44:01.360
what Hegel calls understanding, subsumes Kantian understanding

44:01.360 --> 44:04.560
and Kantian reason.

44:04.560 --> 44:12.120
Hegelian reason is what resolves the contradiction.

44:17.720 --> 44:21.240
So this is purely negative, or the negative dialectic.

44:28.840 --> 44:35.320
Now, that means, although the logic is not about understanding

44:35.320 --> 44:40.040
and reason, we can correlate what's

44:40.040 --> 44:45.640
going on in the logic with these mental capacities.

44:45.640 --> 44:47.760
So once again, we have to always distinguish.

44:47.760 --> 44:51.840
Hegel is not, he doesn't just talk

44:51.840 --> 44:54.080
about the topics of one science in the book

44:54.080 --> 44:55.440
that that science is about.

44:55.440 --> 44:56.840
He also talks about other things.

44:56.840 --> 44:59.120
And so you have to be careful to separate them.

44:59.120 --> 45:01.040
So these reasons of understanding

45:01.040 --> 45:03.920
are not properly logical topics.

45:03.920 --> 45:07.160
These are anticipations of his conception

45:07.160 --> 45:10.160
of the capacities of spirit, the capacities of the mind.

45:14.680 --> 45:19.960
I'm going to skip that and talk about with what

45:19.960 --> 45:22.640
must the beginning of science be made.

45:22.640 --> 45:26.720
Questions up to this point.

45:26.720 --> 45:27.220
Yes.

45:30.000 --> 45:36.080
So if you know P, then you know about the world.

45:36.080 --> 45:40.840
But our knowledge is perception, our perception,

45:40.840 --> 45:44.080
and our subject is perception.

45:44.080 --> 45:51.400
So how do we can say if we know P, and P is not perception?

45:51.400 --> 45:54.800
OK, so I think you're running together

45:54.800 --> 45:57.880
two different parts of the Hegelian story.

45:57.880 --> 46:04.560
So not everything we know is through perception,

46:04.560 --> 46:08.080
because the contents of logic is not something

46:08.080 --> 46:10.880
that we can perceive.

46:10.880 --> 46:16.520
However, what we can perceive is thinkable content.

46:16.520 --> 46:19.560
Therefore, it has the logical structure

46:19.560 --> 46:21.760
that will be uncovered in the logic.

46:21.760 --> 46:24.520
You perceive determinate beings.

46:24.560 --> 46:26.840
You perceive them as having qualities.

46:26.840 --> 46:29.120
You perceive them as being one and many.

46:29.120 --> 46:31.520
You perceive them as quantitatively determinate.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.720
You perceive them as being measurable.

46:33.720 --> 46:36.040
You perceive a difference between how they are

46:36.040 --> 46:38.440
and how they appear to you under certain circumstances,

46:38.440 --> 46:40.120
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

46:40.120 --> 46:43.760
So the deep logical structure of the content of perception

46:43.760 --> 46:47.560
is also provided in the logic, but the topic of the logic

46:47.560 --> 46:51.360
is not that content qua perceivable.

46:51.360 --> 46:53.520
OK, yes.

46:53.520 --> 46:58.400
You said that if you don't want to be like a psychological,

46:58.400 --> 47:00.560
if you want to make logic entirely psychological,

47:00.560 --> 47:03.440
then you have to accept.

47:03.440 --> 47:06.880
But surely the psychological alternative

47:06.880 --> 47:08.440
is like the elephant in the room.

47:08.440 --> 47:11.640
That's the one that I would go to naturally

47:11.640 --> 47:13.440
if I was a skeptic.

47:13.440 --> 47:16.520
So should I just read the phenomenology of spirit?

47:16.520 --> 47:20.280
I think that's Hegel's considered answer.

47:20.280 --> 47:22.840
What he kind of says in the introduction is,

47:22.840 --> 47:27.240
yeah, go study with Frese and stop bugging me.

47:27.240 --> 47:29.800
That is to say, I think Hegel just in the introduction

47:29.800 --> 47:33.600
just has no time for that view.

47:33.600 --> 47:42.360
So Frese is this guy who he's like a Kantian,

47:42.360 --> 47:45.080
but he thinks that Kant's transcendental philosophy

47:45.080 --> 47:47.120
is psychology.

47:47.120 --> 47:52.280
And Hegel has nothing but contempt for that view.

47:52.280 --> 47:54.760
There's a great book about, so one

47:54.760 --> 47:57.280
of the things that happens over the course of the 19th century

47:57.280 --> 48:00.360
is German philosophers periodically go back to Kant

48:00.360 --> 48:03.400
and are like, wait, all the answers were here all along.

48:03.400 --> 48:04.400
Let's just do this.

48:04.400 --> 48:06.700
Let's forget about this fifth The Schelling Hegel stuff.

48:06.700 --> 48:08.280
It's incomprehensible.

48:08.280 --> 48:12.480
And maybe it's falsified by natural science.

48:12.480 --> 48:14.840
There's a great book about the whole thing

48:14.840 --> 48:18.720
by Fred Beiser called The Genesis of Neocontinism.

48:18.720 --> 48:23.560
And that book is basically the history of Kantians being like,

48:23.560 --> 48:25.960
oh, let's make this all about psychology.

48:25.960 --> 48:28.800
And then at some point, they're like, wait.

48:28.800 --> 48:31.480
If it's all about psychology, then it's just

48:31.480 --> 48:33.400
about stuff in space and time.

48:33.400 --> 48:36.080
And so it can't explain how knowledge in space and time

48:36.080 --> 48:37.840
is possible.

48:37.840 --> 48:39.280
And then they're like, oh, I'm not

48:39.280 --> 48:40.560
sure what to do about that.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.920
So it has this slightly dissatisfying quality

48:42.920 --> 48:44.320
of you can see the problem coming

48:44.320 --> 48:46.600
a million times, a million miles away,

48:46.600 --> 48:48.100
and then all of these 19th century

48:48.100 --> 48:50.200
psychologists and neocontians eventually

48:50.200 --> 48:52.200
figure out the thing that was obvious on page one.

48:52.200 --> 48:52.680
Yeah?

48:52.680 --> 48:54.000
Maybe you'll get to this later.

48:54.000 --> 48:56.800
What's then the upshot of me just sitting here

48:56.800 --> 48:59.080
doing regular metaphysics?

48:59.080 --> 49:00.720
What's the upshot?

49:00.720 --> 49:03.120
For Kant, it becomes we're not talking about things

49:03.120 --> 49:04.480
in themselves.

49:04.480 --> 49:07.040
Is there an analogous thing for Hegel?

49:07.040 --> 49:09.160
Oh, you mean what does Hegel think

49:09.160 --> 49:11.800
you're doing if you're just doing spinosistic metaphysics?

49:11.800 --> 49:13.720
Sure.

49:13.720 --> 49:18.480
I think he thinks you are thinking,

49:18.480 --> 49:20.440
but you're not thinking purely.

49:20.440 --> 49:23.000
So some of the content of your thought

49:23.000 --> 49:25.200
will be pure thought content.

49:25.200 --> 49:27.920
And it will get something about the structure of metaphysics

49:27.920 --> 49:28.520
right.

49:28.520 --> 49:30.360
But it won't be scientific.

49:30.360 --> 49:36.000
And so it will be a kind of aggregate of genuinely content

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
that genuinely reveals the metaphysical structure of being

49:39.000 --> 49:42.640
and then just kind of your opinions and weird stuff.

49:42.680 --> 49:46.880
And so because of his commitments

49:46.880 --> 49:50.560
in the philosophy of history, we have to be able to,

49:50.560 --> 49:53.240
if everything Hegel says is true,

49:53.240 --> 49:55.800
then the content of the science of logic

49:55.800 --> 49:58.560
has to be findable in the history of philosophy.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.440
So in principle, we should be able to go back

50:00.440 --> 50:01.960
through the history of philosophy

50:01.960 --> 50:08.640
and find all of this stuff kind of exploded.

50:08.640 --> 50:10.640
It's like there's a logical explosion.

50:10.640 --> 50:17.200
And all of the shrapnel, all of the broken shards

50:17.200 --> 50:20.040
of the logic bomb have been spread over time.

50:20.040 --> 50:23.880
And this sounds very Dr. Who, but the history of philosophy

50:23.880 --> 50:27.400
is like finding all of them and then reassembling them

50:27.400 --> 50:30.440
into Hegelian logic as a confirmation

50:30.440 --> 50:32.480
that we were right about the whole thing.

50:32.480 --> 50:32.980
Yeah?

50:32.980 --> 50:35.200
What about what's happening now?

50:35.200 --> 50:39.360
Well, that's a really good question, actually.

50:39.360 --> 50:41.200
It's actually a very hard question,

50:41.200 --> 50:43.920
which is, what does Hegel think about the future?

50:43.920 --> 50:47.160
And he doesn't say anything about it.

50:47.160 --> 50:48.900
And so some people think that means Hegel

50:48.900 --> 50:50.720
thinks there's no real future.

50:50.720 --> 50:51.840
It's all just this.

50:51.840 --> 50:53.040
Like, we're done.

50:53.040 --> 50:56.240
And we can just repeat it.

50:56.240 --> 50:58.880
That would be very disappointing.

50:58.880 --> 51:01.680
Some people think that shows that Hegel thinks the future is

51:01.680 --> 51:04.360
radically open.

51:04.360 --> 51:06.840
That's ridiculous.

51:06.840 --> 51:07.760
That's not worth it.

51:07.840 --> 51:10.560
I can't even believe that I have to listen to people say that.

51:10.560 --> 51:12.920
That would mean that the Hegel system has an outside,

51:12.920 --> 51:15.160
or there's some stuff that's outside, which would mean,

51:15.160 --> 51:18.720
OK, it's incoherent at every level.

51:18.720 --> 51:20.600
The thing that people are primarily

51:20.600 --> 51:23.480
concerned with about the Hegel future question

51:23.480 --> 51:28.840
is not logical or metaphysics, but his philosophy of right.

51:28.840 --> 51:30.720
Because those will see we get to the philosophy of right.

51:30.720 --> 51:33.040
Hegel says in the preface of the philosophy of right,

51:33.040 --> 51:37.720
something that seems to say, not we've come to the final form,

51:37.720 --> 51:40.880
but I can only just describe this

51:40.880 --> 51:44.000
because the social system that I'm describing is dead.

51:44.000 --> 51:45.800
It's on its way out.

51:45.800 --> 51:48.520
But then what's next?

51:48.520 --> 51:50.760
And Hegel doesn't say, and the philosophy of history

51:50.760 --> 51:53.960
seems to say that there kind of shouldn't be a next, better

51:53.960 --> 51:54.840
social form.

51:54.840 --> 51:57.120
So it's really hard to square those two.

51:57.120 --> 51:58.480
There is a genuine question moment

51:58.480 --> 52:01.080
to say about the future.

52:01.080 --> 52:05.600
Now, my own view is like, your question gets to the question

52:05.600 --> 52:11.800
of what happened to philosophy after classical German

52:11.800 --> 52:12.320
idealism?

52:15.960 --> 52:20.480
And how do you answer that question as a German idealist?

52:20.480 --> 52:25.200
Because from the German idealist perspective, philosophy,

52:25.200 --> 52:27.600
even if you're not a Hegelian, philosophy

52:27.600 --> 52:30.400
kind of stopped after Hegel.

52:30.400 --> 52:33.160
So Schelling lives much longer than Hegel,

52:33.160 --> 52:37.280
and is actually brought to Hegel by the King of Prussia

52:37.280 --> 52:39.960
to take over what is the Ministry of Education,

52:39.960 --> 52:43.960
to take over Hegel's chair in philosophy in Berlin

52:43.960 --> 52:47.920
to combat the specter of Hegelianism,

52:47.920 --> 52:50.680
because Germans took philosophy really seriously.

52:50.680 --> 52:53.760
And then so the everyday hall Schelling out of,

52:53.760 --> 52:55.960
everyone thinks Schelling is dead,

52:55.960 --> 52:58.000
and he looks like he's dead, but he's still alive.

52:58.800 --> 53:04.680
Yes, something happens to philosophy

53:04.680 --> 53:09.120
from the golden age of classical German philosophy to today,

53:09.120 --> 53:14.080
and people vary in their reactions to it.

53:14.080 --> 53:17.120
If you're a committed German idealist, especially

53:17.120 --> 53:18.400
if you're a Hegelian, you really have

53:18.400 --> 53:20.200
to think that a lot of what happened after Hegel

53:20.200 --> 53:22.720
wasn't philosophy.

53:22.720 --> 53:25.400
Or at least it wasn't moving the ball forward.

53:25.480 --> 53:28.600
It's a repetition of previous things.

53:28.600 --> 53:33.720
Now, does that confirm Hegel's philosophy of history,

53:33.720 --> 53:36.160
or his philosophy of history of philosophy?

53:36.160 --> 53:38.160
Does it refute it?

53:38.160 --> 53:40.240
We'll talk about that when we get there.

53:40.240 --> 53:44.200
And I don't want to, I've already

53:44.200 --> 53:47.160
shown too much of my hand about my own views about these things

53:47.160 --> 53:51.360
that I don't want to give you a lecture on the trappitude

53:51.360 --> 53:53.160
of philosophy since the death of Hegel.

53:53.160 --> 53:54.800
OK, I realize there are other questions,

53:54.840 --> 53:58.280
but I also need to get to the question of,

53:58.280 --> 54:03.160
with what must the beginning of science be made?

54:03.160 --> 54:05.800
OK, so once again, on the handout,

54:05.800 --> 54:11.440
I've outlined the structure, as I interpret it, of this section.

54:11.440 --> 54:13.520
It starts out with some introductory remarks

54:13.520 --> 54:16.720
about the general question of the problem of the beginning

54:16.720 --> 54:19.600
in philosophy, and then it gets an exposition

54:19.600 --> 54:23.040
of the beginning of the science a lot, the pure science.

54:23.040 --> 54:24.640
And then there's some further reflections,

54:24.640 --> 54:27.160
and there's a discussion in Fitbit and other post-contients,

54:27.160 --> 54:28.800
which I will skip.

54:28.800 --> 54:31.280
OK, so the first three paragraphs

54:31.280 --> 54:35.680
introduce the theme of, what is the beginning of philosophy?

54:35.680 --> 54:37.360
Where that can be understood either

54:37.360 --> 54:40.040
as an ontological or metaphysical beginning, what

54:40.040 --> 54:42.280
is the first principle?

54:42.280 --> 54:45.720
Or an epistemological or methodological beginning?

54:45.720 --> 54:48.320
What is our access to that first principle?

54:48.320 --> 54:51.440
How do we methodologically begin in philosophy?

54:51.440 --> 54:54.600
Now, this essay is a response to,

54:54.600 --> 55:00.640
it's an outgrowth of an incredible methodological,

55:00.640 --> 55:05.680
a series of interventions in German philosophy

55:05.680 --> 55:09.840
between Kant and Hegel that become extremely

55:09.840 --> 55:12.720
methodologically self-conscious about what philosophy is

55:12.720 --> 55:18.400
and how to do it, that I won't go into now.

55:18.400 --> 55:21.000
So the project of science of logic, of course,

55:21.080 --> 55:24.720
is to unfold from thought itself the determinations of thought.

55:24.720 --> 55:29.880
So the beginning of logic is the first category or thought

55:29.880 --> 55:32.400
determination of logic.

55:32.400 --> 55:38.000
So the real question here is, what do we begin logically?

55:38.000 --> 55:42.720
Now, should the beginning be immediate,

55:42.720 --> 55:45.800
or should it be immediate?

55:45.800 --> 55:49.480
Now, Hegel begins by telling us that it

55:49.480 --> 55:53.040
can be neither immediate nor immediate,

55:53.040 --> 55:54.880
but then goes on immediately to say

55:54.880 --> 55:57.880
that it is both immediate and immediate.

55:57.880 --> 56:02.040
He says, in fact, that everything under heaven

56:02.040 --> 56:05.560
and on Earth is both immediate and immediate.

56:05.560 --> 56:08.440
So we have to understand what that means.

56:08.440 --> 56:12.040
So I think the mistake is assuming

56:12.040 --> 56:15.800
that if something is immediate, it isn't immediate and vice

56:15.800 --> 56:20.600
versa, because if that were the case,

56:20.600 --> 56:23.680
then the claim that everything was immediate and immediate

56:23.680 --> 56:24.840
would be a contradiction.

56:24.840 --> 56:26.280
And it wouldn't be a contradiction

56:26.280 --> 56:28.440
that, so to speak, Hegel takes away or revolves.

56:28.440 --> 56:31.840
It would just be left with a contradiction.

56:31.840 --> 56:34.880
So what do we mean by mediation?

56:34.880 --> 56:38.840
Now, there's at least three senses of mediation

56:38.840 --> 56:41.000
that are relevant.

56:41.000 --> 56:45.680
What I call on the handout, metaphysical mediation,

56:45.800 --> 56:49.520
epistemic mediation, and semantic mediation.

56:49.520 --> 56:53.960
And the idea of mediation, I'm looking for the definition,

56:53.960 --> 56:56.600
I put a note about the definition of mediation

56:56.600 --> 57:00.120
in the encyclopedias, but I won't find it in a moment.

57:00.120 --> 57:00.960
Here it is.

57:00.960 --> 57:04.920
This is page 40 in the encyclopediologic reading.

57:04.920 --> 57:06.160
I'll just read it out loud.

57:06.160 --> 57:07.680
It's a very short sentence.

57:07.680 --> 57:10.840
Mediation means to make a beginning

57:10.840 --> 57:13.440
and then to have proceeded to a second item,

57:14.360 --> 57:18.000
such that this second item is the way it is only

57:18.000 --> 57:22.520
insofar as one has arrived at it by starting with something

57:22.520 --> 57:24.960
that is an other over against it.

57:24.960 --> 57:28.720
So mediation means there's two things,

57:28.720 --> 57:32.560
and one of them is arrived at by means of,

57:32.560 --> 57:35.720
and is therefore distinct from, the other.

57:35.720 --> 57:39.640
So metaphysical mediation would be something like x,

57:39.640 --> 57:42.240
one thing is in virtue of another,

57:42.240 --> 57:44.360
or it ontologically depends upon another,

57:44.360 --> 57:47.120
or as we now say is grounded in another.

57:47.120 --> 57:50.840
Epistemic mediation would be knowing something

57:50.840 --> 57:52.840
by means of knowing something else.

57:53.720 --> 57:56.640
The classic example would be inferring something

57:56.640 --> 57:58.160
from something else.

57:58.160 --> 58:01.240
And semantic mediation would be that something

58:01.240 --> 58:04.920
has its meaning, or is the content it is,

58:04.920 --> 58:06.680
in virtue of its relation to something else.

58:06.680 --> 58:08.720
That would be something like a definition.

58:09.720 --> 58:14.400
So bachelor is semantically mediated by unmarried.

58:15.320 --> 58:18.440
If these two concepts are defined in relation

58:18.440 --> 58:21.440
to one another, they're mutually mediated.

58:23.240 --> 58:25.680
Now what would a presupposition be?

58:25.680 --> 58:28.720
It would be something that isn't mediated by something else.

58:28.720 --> 58:30.480
So a metaphysi, sorry, it would be something

58:30.480 --> 58:32.440
that is mediated by something else.

58:32.440 --> 58:36.280
So something is a metaphysical presupposition

58:36.280 --> 58:37.880
if it grounds something else.

58:38.040 --> 58:40.920
It's an epistemic presupposition

58:40.920 --> 58:43.000
if it allows you to know something.

58:43.000 --> 58:44.640
It's a semantic presupposition

58:44.640 --> 58:47.120
if it allows you to define something else.

58:47.120 --> 58:49.680
So if something were presuppositionless,

58:49.680 --> 58:52.440
it would have to be metaphysically ungrounded,

58:52.440 --> 58:55.880
epistemically immediate, and semantically immediate.

58:55.880 --> 59:00.880
Okay, now what is the relevant notion of mediation,

59:01.040 --> 59:02.840
and therefore beginning for Hegel?

59:03.760 --> 59:08.760
Well, in some sense, one and three are identical in the lot.

59:10.360 --> 59:15.360
Because we know something by means

59:16.080 --> 59:18.560
of its semantic relationships

59:18.560 --> 59:20.560
of some other thought content.

59:20.560 --> 59:25.160
A thought content is what it is via its semantic relations.

59:25.160 --> 59:28.560
So semantic and metaphysical dependency go together

59:28.560 --> 59:31.880
with one another with respect to things

59:31.920 --> 59:34.920
that are essentially semantic, essentially thought contents.

59:34.920 --> 59:38.120
And likewise, in the logic, we would assume

59:38.120 --> 59:42.120
that we know things via that which defines them.

59:43.040 --> 59:45.280
But I wanna focus on the third

59:45.280 --> 59:49.780
because we're focused on thought contents.

59:50.920 --> 59:54.400
Okay, so the project of the logic has to be,

59:54.400 --> 59:57.760
means that we have to begin with an immediate thought content.

59:57.760 --> 59:59.280
The first category of the logic

59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.000
has to be an immediate thought context

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.280
because the project is to unfold all the contents

01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.500
of thinking from thinking itself.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:09.700
If it began with a thought content A

01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:12.240
that was semantically mediated by something else B,

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:14.440
that is to say, it was the thought content

01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:16.920
and it was via B or was defined in terms of B,

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:19.540
then we should have started with B.

01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.680
B would be the true beginning of the logic.

01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:27.820
Okay, so we need a immediate beginning for the logic.

01:00:27.980 --> 01:00:30.820
Immediate beginning for the logic.

01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:32.380
So the beginning of the logic

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:34.220
has to be an immediate thought content.

01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:40.300
Okay, so, Hegel gives a little argument at 21.55

01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:48.060
for what the beginning of logic should be.

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.160
This is,

01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:55.060
is it 25.55?

01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:01.900
So it's actually 25.56.

01:01:01.900 --> 01:01:04.780
It's basically the paragraph that begins,

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:07.980
being is what makes the beginning here and then ends,

01:01:07.980 --> 01:01:09.780
the beginning is there for a pure being.

01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:14.860
But I think actually we can just skip most of that paragraph

01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:17.220
and just focus on the last two sentences,

01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:19.020
which I have on the handout.

01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.220
Just as it cannot have any determination

01:01:21.220 --> 01:01:24.100
with respect to another, the beginning,

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:26.500
so to it cannot have any within it.

01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:28.620
It cannot have any content,

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:31.180
or any content would entail distinction

01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:33.700
and the reference of distinct moments to each other

01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:35.680
and hence a mediation.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:39.660
The beginning is therefore pure being.

01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:40.960
Okay, so here's my reconstruction

01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.740
of how Hegel is reasoning there.

01:01:44.260 --> 01:01:45.860
The beginning has to be immediate.

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.260
If it were determined, that is to say,

01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.220
we're either internally determined,

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:56.060
it has parts that are determined with respect to another,

01:01:56.060 --> 01:01:57.580
or if it was determinate with respect

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.220
to something distinct from it, it would be immediate.

01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:02.940
Why?

01:02:02.940 --> 01:02:07.420
Because determinacy, to be a specific determinate thing,

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:10.580
requires not being something else.

01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:17.260
And determinacy is a, sorry,

01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:24.460
this is slightly less precise than I would have liked.

01:02:26.300 --> 01:02:31.300
Let me just articulate this, okay.

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:40.620
So the beginning must be immediate.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.140
Because if it were not, that which mediates it

01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.620
would be a true beginning.

01:02:53.620 --> 01:02:58.620
If it is immediate, then it is indeterminate.

01:03:10.900 --> 01:03:11.740
Why?

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:17.860
Because determinacy entails negation.

01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:22.500
Why?

01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:26.380
Because determinacy is to be one thing

01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.780
rather than something else.

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:32.700
And that requires not being or negation.

01:03:32.700 --> 01:03:35.700
Or in other words, Hegel is appealing to

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:38.500
the Spittisist principle,

01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.140
omnis determinatio,

01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:44.420
as negatio.

01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:49.420
Okay, this appears in letter 50

01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:58.060
of Spinoza to a guy named Jorig Yellis.

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:01.620
So if you want your name to live in eternity,

01:04:01.620 --> 01:04:04.060
and you don't think you have it in you

01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.140
to write one of the great works

01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:07.780
of the history of philosophy,

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.940
make sure that one of the great philosophers

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:11.500
of all time writes you a letter.

01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:14.620
And then for now until eternity,

01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:19.660
people will mention your name.

01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:22.220
Jorig Yellis, lost history.

01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:25.300
I mention this guy's name in like every class I teach.

01:04:25.300 --> 01:04:26.660
He will live forever.

01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:27.740
Is it not letter 50?

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:29.060
No, it is, I have a question.

01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:30.140
Oh, you know, sorry.

01:04:30.140 --> 01:04:31.060
Okay, no.

01:04:34.820 --> 01:04:37.660
Spinoza doesn't put the word omnisig.

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.500
That's an interpolation.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.740
I think it's interpretively correct.

01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:43.180
I think it's very clear in context.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.780
He doesn't just say determination is negation.

01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.780
He means all determination is negation.

01:04:51.100 --> 01:04:51.940
Okay.

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:57.300
So the beginning has to be completely indeterminate.

01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:02.060
Okay, that is to say if it's completely indeterminate,

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:06.620
if something isn't something else,

01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.060
it's also determinate.

01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:09.500
It's not that thing.

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:12.340
It's not just that determinacy entails negation.

01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:13.900
They're the same.

01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:15.980
So the beginning of logic has to be

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:17.860
not only completely indeterminate,

01:05:17.860 --> 01:05:19.180
but completely non-negated.

01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:23.660
What is pure science about?

01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:26.780
It's about the content of things.

01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:27.900
What does thought think about?

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:28.940
It talks about being.

01:05:30.020 --> 01:05:32.740
So the first category of the logic

01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:37.740
has to be completely indeterminate, non-negated being.

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.380
Completely indeterminate, immediacy.

01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.460
That is to say it's not a thought about this being

01:05:43.460 --> 01:05:47.820
or that being, this kind of being, this way of being.

01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:49.460
It's just being.

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:55.140
Or as Hegel sometimes characterizes it, purity.

01:05:56.460 --> 01:05:59.140
That means there's a thematic connection

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:02.660
between the beginning of the logic and sense certainty.

01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:04.860
So one of the things we'll eventually have to talk about

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:06.860
is what exactly is the relationship

01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:09.540
between the beginning of logic and sense certainty.

01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:12.580
And I am not entirely sure what I think about that.

01:06:12.580 --> 01:06:13.420
Hojo and then you.

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:16.500
Yes, so premise one, would you say it's descriptive

01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:17.460
or is it normative?

01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:19.540
And also is premise one itself a first principle

01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.700
or is it further justified?

01:06:21.700 --> 01:06:24.220
It's further justified because what we're doing here,

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:25.660
we're not doing logic yet.

01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:27.660
All of these are external remarks

01:06:27.660 --> 01:06:30.780
because none of this stuff has been derived in logic.

01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:34.020
We're all just kind of fancy-footin'.

01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:36.100
This is all just like, you know.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:40.420
Hegel's like, it's not that he doesn't want to start sign

01:06:40.420 --> 01:06:41.740
pure thinking.

01:06:41.740 --> 01:06:45.580
It's like he's delaying the beginning of as long as possible

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:48.140
so that you have as much preparation as possible

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:51.580
before we dive right in and think purity.

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:52.420
Yes.

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:53.580
Two questions.

01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:56.380
So can we say negation is pure supposition,

01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.940
this is first, and the second question,

01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:00.820
the beginning is pure being.

01:07:01.820 --> 01:07:06.660
Can we say the pure being is I and I is perception?

01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:10.220
No, no I, no perception.

01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:11.940
However, there is a connection

01:07:11.940 --> 01:07:15.460
because the first principle of fixtus philosophy is I

01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:18.620
and Hegel thinks that's just as indeterminate

01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:20.140
as pure being.

01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:21.860
And so fixtus to be congratulated

01:07:21.860 --> 01:07:24.140
with a completely indeterminate starting point.

01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:29.140
But A, it's not absolute

01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:31.740
because being an I or being a subject,

01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:34.540
it's defined through what it isn't,

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:35.460
namely the object.

01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:37.580
So we're not yet at a completely presuppositionless

01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:39.020
or absolute starting point.

01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:44.020
And the way fixtus system of philosophy works,

01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:45.940
when we start with that starting point,

01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:47.700
we can't get any further.

01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:50.420
And Hegel thinks his system is set up in such a way

01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:53.060
that we can get further than purity.

01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:53.900
Yeah.

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:55.620
Oh sorry, okay, yeah.

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:59.100
So can we say negation is pure supposition?

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.620
I don't wanna go so far as to say

01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:04.740
that negation and presupposition are always the same thing.

01:08:04.740 --> 01:08:07.260
If I presuppose something,

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:10.940
then there's what's being presupposed

01:08:10.940 --> 01:08:14.300
and what that presupposition supports, so to speak,

01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:15.620
what's supposed.

01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:17.500
There's the supposition and the presupposition.

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:18.900
They have to be different.

01:08:18.900 --> 01:08:20.580
And so they have to be determinate

01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:21.620
with respect to one another.

01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:24.640
So wherever there's presupposition, there is negation.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:27.020
I wouldn't wanna go so far as to say that negation

01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:29.940
always involves presupposition of all being.

01:08:29.940 --> 01:08:31.140
Yeah.

01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:34.940
So far, in the short argument for idealism

01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.700
or for thought, has it come from being kind of

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:42.180
as like the assumption of our collection of all being?

01:08:42.180 --> 01:08:45.140
I didn't, that's your interpretation, I didn't say that.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:46.260
Okay.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.380
Being is definitely not a collection of all being.

01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:50.700
Because then being would be a being.

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:52.300
And there would be the following question.

01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:53.940
Is there a being beyond that collection?

01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:56.820
Namely, a being beyond being, and that's incoherent.

01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.260
Except, I should know there are all these people.

01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:04.260
There's this tradition, as some of you know very well,

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.940
of thinking that the form of the good

01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:08.060
in play that would be beyond being.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.060
So it's not a being.

01:09:10.100 --> 01:09:13.300
I can't really make any sense of that.

01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:14.660
Yeah, how do you think?

01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:18.420
So is immediacy related to your own collection?

01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:22.140
And what does immediacy, immediacy, distinction

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:24.660
relate to at the beginning?

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.940
They're related, but they're not identical.

01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:31.580
So if there's a condition and a condition,

01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:34.300
then they're distinct and they're determinate

01:09:34.300 --> 01:09:36.100
partly in relation to one another.

01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:38.420
To be a condition is to be the condition

01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:40.860
of some condition, which you are not.

01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:43.940
To be a condition just to be conditioned by something,

01:09:43.940 --> 01:09:46.020
to have a condition that you are not.

01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:48.140
So those are determinate and they have all negation.

01:09:48.140 --> 01:09:51.500
But not all determinacy negation relations

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:52.900
are conditioning relations.

01:09:52.900 --> 01:09:55.900
Because a conditioning relation is asymmetric.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.540
So I don't think it's right to say

01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.660
that these condition relationships.

01:09:59.660 --> 01:10:02.500
So conditioning relations, asymmetric relations

01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:05.860
of ontological dependence, become the topic of the logic.

01:10:05.860 --> 01:10:07.900
They don't start out as the topic of the logic.

01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:10.100
They're the topic of the doctrine of essence,

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:13.100
the second of the third parts of the logic.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:14.220
Yes?

01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.700
Can you just say that the beginning

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:17.900
of being immediate and distinguish

01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:21.900
from the immediate is therefore just a meaning?

01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.980
That is exactly the problem that we'll talk about next week.

01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:27.780
That is the problem on which the entire Hegelian enterprise

01:10:27.780 --> 01:10:30.460
potentially falters.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:33.060
And everyone's been worried about this

01:10:33.060 --> 01:10:35.900
since Schelling, his former college roommate,

01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:38.500
was kind enough to point this out in public.

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:38.980
Yes?

01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:41.300
So we haven't actually started the science of logic

01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:42.060
problem yet.

01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:42.780
No.

01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.140
You have not thought purely yet.

01:10:44.140 --> 01:10:44.660
No.

01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:45.660
So we start presumable.

01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:47.420
I know that was not meant personally.

01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:49.860
For all I know, you think you're real.

01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:54.020
So we start with being pure being in the actual science of logic.

01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:58.420
So this argument doesn't really serve any purpose

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:00.940
besides to convince ourselves as the reader that OK.

01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:01.440
Yes.

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:01.940
Yes.

01:11:06.940 --> 01:11:10.420
What exactly is the problem of needing a beginning?

01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:12.220
I think I just lost a step.

01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:13.940
OK.

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:15.820
We want to do pure science.

01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:19.020
Yeah.

01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:20.060
We have to start somewhere.

01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:20.540
Yeah.

01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:26.660
The starting point has to be scientifically determined.

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:28.180
It can't be arbitrary.

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:30.780
Because if it were arbitrary, where we get

01:11:30.780 --> 01:11:32.820
might depend on where we started.

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:35.660
And if where we get is arbitrary, if it's just like,

01:11:35.660 --> 01:11:38.860
this is a plausible starting point, then where we get might be arbitrary.

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:40.420
And that it wouldn't be scientific.

01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:42.920
OK.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:43.420
Yes.

01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:47.820
Hagle have any friends?

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:49.820
Sorry.

01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:50.320
Yes.

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:51.820
He was actually a super fun guy.

01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:54.820
Well, if it's on contemporaries, they're thinking of empirical scientists.

01:11:54.820 --> 01:12:00.140
We're talking about absolute knowledge.

01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:03.460
Were there any empirical scientists who went, hey, there's something in this

01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:04.460
that we ought to know about?

01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:04.940
Yes.

01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:07.500
But I don't know enough about it.

01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:12.820
So Hagle is intimately acquainted with and involved

01:12:12.820 --> 01:12:15.100
with the empirical natural science of his day.

01:12:15.100 --> 01:12:18.420
Knows it as well as it's possible for anyone

01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:20.940
to know all of the sciences of the 19th century.

01:12:20.940 --> 01:12:24.100
And in fact, what's the main thing that Hagle

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:28.500
does in the second edition of The Doctrine and Being?

01:12:28.500 --> 01:12:31.820
It's not addressed the problem about the beginning of the logic

01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:34.020
that everyone has been worried about.

01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:35.740
He seems to think there's no problem.

01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:37.980
So either there's no problem or Hagle is the worst

01:12:37.980 --> 01:12:40.460
philosopher of the 19th century.

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:42.380
What does he primarily do?

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:48.420
He massively updates the treatment of calculus in The Doctrine and Being.

01:12:48.420 --> 01:12:54.060
So there's this enormous digression about the mathematics of the infinite

01:12:54.060 --> 01:12:56.180
in the first half of the science of logic.

01:12:56.180 --> 01:12:57.820
Here's the problem.

01:12:57.820 --> 01:13:01.100
Historical mathematics is weird.

01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:04.260
The calculus you learned in your calculus class

01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:09.860
is cleaned up post-Vierstrass, post-Dedekind presentations of calculus.

01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:14.380
When you read historical calculus texts, they're fucking wild.

01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:18.540
And they do things in this completely unnatural geometric way.

01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.940
Because they don't have a rigorous definition of a limit.

01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:24.900
They don't have a digorous definition of continuity.

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.460
So they've got to do it with this kind of jiggery-pogory.

01:13:28.460 --> 01:13:33.220
And Hagle has read all of the relevant books

01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:38.260
by Lagrange and everybody and is completely fully up to date with it

01:13:38.260 --> 01:13:46.740
and writes this super long digression about how only his metaphysics of quantity

01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:51.300
explains properly what the quantitative infinite is.

01:13:51.300 --> 01:13:54.460
And otherwise, you can't do calculus properly.

01:13:54.460 --> 01:14:03.260
So if you want this class to take a really weird 90-degree term, OK.

01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:03.900
That'll be it.

01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:05.900
I'll see you next week.

01:14:08.260 --> 01:14:17.580
Can I ask, you can ask all the questions.

01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:23.420
Why is this called German idealism when it seems like such an extreme realism?

01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:31.460
So Marcus Gabriel, his joke about this is the English translation of idealism is realism.

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.580
Now, the reason is, as we see.
