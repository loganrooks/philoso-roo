0	8840	is the only possible justification for the logic being
8840	13440	the science of logic being also the science of being.
13440	15440	The self-determining content of thought
15440	18440	is structurally identical to the self-determining content
18440	20960	of being.
20960	23640	And so that's why Hegel says in the Encyclopedia,
23640	28320	paragraph 24, the logic coincides with metaphysics.
28360	31120	They have the same content.
31120	36520	Hegel's just told us that the deduction of that science,
36520	40280	the science that is both logic and metaphysics,
40280	42600	is the phenomenology of spirit itself.
42600	47520	And the phenomenology is, let's see, 500 pages?
47520	49480	500 pages, 466.
49480	51080	So that's a little disappointing,
51080	55200	because if you want to know why the science of logic
55200	57520	is actually a metaphysics, if you
57520	60320	want to see the deduction of this science
60320	62400	and its justification, you need to read
62400	63880	the whole phenomenology of spirit.
63880	65760	And every step in the phenomenology of spirit
65760	67520	needs to work.
67520	70240	But I think there's internal evidence.
70240	72660	That's why I assigned those passages
72660	74160	from the Encyclopedia.
74160	77280	There's internal evidence in the Encyclopedia
77280	79680	that Hegel thinks there's a shorter
79680	83280	argument to that conclusion.
83280	86720	Now, that is to say.
86720	90880	So what is the relationship between these two things?
90880	93000	I'm not sure what the relationship between these two
93000	94280	things is.
94280	101480	I think that the argument that I call the short argument
101480	106480	is sufficient to establish the logic
106480	108500	as being what the science of thinking
108500	111000	and the science of metaphysics, the science of thinking
111000	113720	and the science of being what being.
113720	119360	But it won't repel any possible skepticism
119360	123800	as to whether that is knowing, whether it is science,
123800	127600	and whether it is all that science and knowing could be.
127600	129240	That is to say, if you really want
129240	132480	to press Hegel with skeptical objections
132480	135380	about the possibility of a science of logic
135380	140960	slash metaphysics, the following short argument won't suffice.
140960	145800	So there's a passage in the science of logic
145800	150480	that I think indicates that he has something
150480	153120	like the following short argument in mind.
153120	155440	This is at 2134.
155440	157640	On the other side, one can appeal
157640	160920	to the representations typical of ordinary logic.
160920	162520	For it is assumed that in definitions,
162520	164440	for example, the determinations are not just
164440	167240	of the knowing subject, but are rather determinations
167240	170120	of the subject matter, such that constitutes
170120	171760	in our most essential nature.
171760	176880	So the idea is, just like totally ordinary logic,
176880	179960	we assume that when we define a concept,
179960	182640	we haven't just learned something about our concept.
182640	185020	We've learned something about being.
185020	190560	If I say, let concepts be, that's a bad example,
190560	195120	let a bachelor refer to unmarried males.
195120	199560	We've learned both what the concept bachelor is,
199560	203120	and we've learned what bachelors are.
203120	205320	We've learned something about the world,
205320	207720	and we've learned something about our concepts.
207720	209440	And those are two different facts
209440	211520	under two different modes of description.
211520	214960	It's not possible for those things to come apart.
214960	217640	Now, it might be that our concepts
217640	221160	don't carve reality at instruction.
221160	225200	So merely defining might not get you at the structure.
225200	228120	Might be that, as probably as difficult.
228120	231360	Being is not carved up into bachelors in life.
231360	234560	This is not an ontologically important distinction.
234560	239680	But if you can just do ordinary logic,
239680	242280	you can't really entertain skepticism
242280	245720	about whether ordinary logic is truer.
245720	250080	And that means either you can't do logic in ordinary sense,
250080	255240	or ordinary logic is already a guide to being.
255240	258000	Or in an inference drawn from given determinations
258280	260720	to others, the assumption is that the inferred
260720	263080	is not something external to the subject matter
263080	267280	and alien to it, but that it belongs to it instead.
267280	271680	That to the thought, there corresponds being.
271680	274080	So what Hegel has in mind is just
274080	280160	in doing a totally ordinary inference in what is ordinarily
280160	287080	called logic, you have to presuppose you can't entertain
287080	290640	skepticism about, so to speak, the metaphysical importance
290640	291480	of that claim.
291480	297440	So let's just, as simple as possible inference,
297440	299640	I'm not even sure that Hegel considered this inference.
299640	310240	So let's say P, therefore, either P or Q, this is called.
310240	313400	Not necessarily an inference that logicians
313400	315400	in the ordinary sense would accept in Hegel's input.
315400	318480	So let's just back it up.
318480	323560	Now, if you've accepted this as a valid inference in logic,
323560	330840	you've accepted that if P is true, then P or Q is true.
330840	347440	So you've also accepted that if P, then if P or Q. Now, you can't,
347440	351440	as long as you accept this as a rule of inference in logic,
351440	356960	you have to accept that it preserves truth.
356960	359240	And if you accept that it preserves truth,
359280	363040	you've accepted, essentially, a claim about reality.
363040	367800	Because notice, this doesn't say anything about inference or truth.
367800	372120	This is, so to speak, purely metaphysical.
372120	375280	It just makes a claim about the world.
375280	378680	And this is what we do in logic.
378680	386440	So if you can do this, and this is knowing, if you know this,
386440	389440	then you know some things about the world.
389440	391880	And you know them purely.
391880	394520	So either you're a skeptic about this, and then Hegel thinks,
394520	397800	well, now you can't do any science of anything.
397800	400440	You're a real skeptic.
400440	403840	Because you'll be like, oh, here's just another example.
403840	409920	P and Q, therefore, P and Q. I know Hegel was German,
409920	411200	and I know Kant was German.
411200	414440	But I don't know whether Kant was German and Hegel was German.
414440	417400	Now you've just totally made it impossible for yourself
417400	419480	to do science about anything.
419480	423920	So the idea is, just in accepting ordinary logical
423920	427640	inference as preserving truth, you
427640	432680	are accrediting yourself knowledge of the world.
432680	434480	Because that is actually indirectly knowledge
434480	435080	of the world.
435080	437600	Now, you might think that's really trivial formal knowledge
437600	438680	of the world.
438680	441800	And Hegel will say, that's what you're totally entitled to think
441800	443120	of that until you read my logic.
443120	444640	Because what I'm going to show you
444640	447120	is things even more basic than this develop
447120	448760	really contentful knowledge.
448760	450560	So the idea is this, Hegel wants to get you
450560	453560	on the hook for thinking that there's no, let me just finish,
453560	459640	there's no coherent skepticism about the metaphysical import
459640	461040	of logic.
461040	463760	We can just translate from logical truths
463760	465280	to metaphysical truths, although they're
465280	468200	pretty rinky dinky metaphysical truths so far.
468200	469160	Here's another example.
473200	477120	Can you coherently entertain skepticism
477120	480960	about the law of logic?
480960	483080	There are no true contradictions.
483080	485120	So let's just say the principle of contradiction
485120	487560	is there are no true contradictions.
496120	498120	OK.
498120	502000	Now, if you accept that as a law of logic,
502000	505000	Hegel thinks, you have to accept not merely,
505000	507360	oh, you shouldn't think that there
507360	509200	are any true contradictions.
509200	517640	But there are no contradictory thoughts.
517640	519840	That is to say, anything that's contradictory
519840	522120	isn't actually thinkable.
522120	525160	So the question is, can you entertain the following thought?
528720	533720	There are no contradictory, self-contradictory thoughts.
542640	548000	But maybe the principle of contradiction
548000	557680	is inaccurate about being capitalized.
557680	559920	Is that a coherent thought?
559920	561720	Well, no, Hegel thinks.
561720	565080	Because insofar as you entertain that,
565080	575760	you're entertaining the thought maybe it
575760	586440	is inaccurate to being that there
586440	591200	are no true contradictions.
597200	599000	Well, what's a true contradiction?
601760	604240	It's a contradictory thought.
604240	607840	So to entertain skepticism about the metaphysical import
607840	612600	of the principle of contradiction is self-underbody.
612600	615360	Because you're attempting to hold in your thought.
615360	618920	There are no self-contradictory thoughts.
618920	621800	But maybe there are some true ones.
621800	624160	Now, this presupposes two things.
624160	628600	It presupposes what's called the constitutive conception
628600	629120	of logic.
635240	643160	That is to say, it presupposes that what you find out in logic
643160	647040	is the structure that thoughts have to have.
647040	648800	Not the structure that they ought to have,
648800	651600	but the structure that thoughts as such have.
651600	654800	And that's why it's incoherent to entertain that
654800	658240	and then entertain skepticism of whether it might be some others.
658240	662520	And secondly, the truth is the predicate of thoughts.
664240	674400	Because that's what allowed me to go from there's
674400	677840	true contradictions, there are true contradictory thoughts.
677840	679760	Without that, this argument doesn't work.
679760	683000	Now, this is an oversimplification
683000	685680	because Hegel doesn't really hold this view.
685680	689000	Doesn't really hold the constitutive conception
689000	690320	of logic.
690320	692640	And this is a thing you might think,
692640	695960	maybe Hegel's thought is vulnerable there.
695960	699440	Maybe he's just assuming a certain idealist view.
699440	704480	Namely, that truth is a matter of thought.
704480	709720	But I actually don't think Hegel is vulnerable on that point.
709720	712400	So here's the idea.
712440	724960	The idea is let's see if we can make skepticism
724960	728720	about the metaphysical import of logic coherent
728720	732880	by distancing reality from thought.
732880	737240	We could say, look, there might be contradictions.
737240	741600	It might be the case that P had not P. Even though we have
741600	745520	to think, we can't think that.
745520	748520	There can't be any P and not P thoughts.
748520	751440	So already, you're like, well, what was I doing?
751440	757800	But already, so then, next move, if P and not P is the case,
757800	763680	then isn't it the case that P and not P is true?
763680	766880	So you could reject that.
766880	768280	That's potentially a question.
768280	770440	But then Hegel, I think his question would be,
770480	773520	what are you even talking about?
773520	779560	How could it be the case that this, without it being true?
779560	782280	I think Hegel thinks this is the most trivial thing
782280	784440	in philosophy.
784440	789960	Q if and only if it's true that Q.
789960	794640	The way in which Donald Davidson is a Hegelian.
794640	797440	Although, actually, there was a lecture here years ago
797440	803000	about what kind of idealist is Hegel.
803000	806040	And my objection at one point was, well, if this is right,
806040	808360	then Donald Davidson is an absolute idealist.
808360	812840	And the speaker was like, yes, exactly, Donald Davidson.
812840	814440	That's not right.
814440	815760	Now we're a good friend of mine.
815760	818680	So then the question is, OK.
818680	822320	So that doesn't look, that Hegel looks pretty good then.
822360	828480	The next thing you could say is P and not P is not a thought.
833360	836840	So you might think, OK, look, sure,
836840	841560	we can't think contradictory whatevers.
841560	845840	But truth is not a property of thoughts.
845840	848240	It's a property of something like propositions.
852320	862280	So I just want to know, when Hegel talks about thoughts,
862280	866000	he doesn't mean activities of human spirit.
866000	870040	He means the content of activities of human spirit.
870040	876880	So thought in Hegel, pedanka, is something
876880	883440	like a content of thought in the psychological sense.
890840	893160	So then I want to know, what does this person
893160	896520	mean by a proposition if they don't mean a content of thought?
899320	901840	And if they really mean, oh, the propositions
901840	903840	are not contents of thoughts, then I
903840	906360	have no idea what they're talking about.
906360	909440	And I'm not sure that they know what they're talking about.
909440	914560	So finally, the final source of possible skepticism
914560	918360	about this argument is you might say, oh,
918360	922120	but logic isn't about propositions.
922120	924280	It's just about our thinking.
924280	929800	But then you've saved logic from having
929800	933720	any metaphysical import by making it purely psychological.
933720	935520	It's just about our psychological activities
935560	937960	rather than its content.
937960	941520	So the Hegelian point is there's no pathway
941520	945480	once you accept that we do logic in the ordinary sense,
945480	948600	without which there's no science of anything.
948600	952600	And once you've accepted that logic is not just psychology,
952600	955920	not about the psychological activity of thought
955920	959440	that happens in space and time, so the content of thought,
959440	964480	then you're on the hook for the metaphysical import of logic.
964480	968160	So that's the short argument to the conclusion
968160	973320	that if we can determine non-trivial facts
973320	979000	about the content of thinking as such, any thinking as such,
979000	982240	we will have determined non-trivial facts
982240	985160	about the structure of being.
985160	989040	That is to say, we can go from logic to medical.
989040	992440	Now, this by itself isn't that interesting
992440	997480	if all it gets to you is trivial logical truth.
997480	1006720	Very few people would deny that the tautologies
1006720	1009600	of predicate logic, or tautologies
1009600	1013360	of propositional logic, are metaphysically necessary.
1016400	1019120	The Hegelian, what makes this more interesting
1019120	1024120	is Hegel is going to argue that the structure according
1024120	1026440	to which thought just as such has to think
1026440	1030520	is significantly richer and more contentful than just
1030520	1033280	the tautologies of propositional logic, much less
1033280	1035400	the tautologies of Aristotelian logic, which are just
1035400	1038880	like the principle contradiction.
1038880	1042560	This is the stuff that I went over last time
1042560	1044960	in a little bit more detail than I went over last.
1044960	1047040	So here's another thing.
1047040	1051120	Hegel fundamentally doesn't think of logic in terms of laws.
1051120	1055640	So we now think of logic as the laws of what is true.
1055640	1057560	What follows from what?
1057560	1059220	And then there are some trivial things
1059220	1061440	that follow from no assumptions whatsoever,
1061440	1063120	and they're just true.
1063120	1065160	Those are the laws of logic.
1065160	1067120	Hegel doesn't really think in those terms.
1067120	1071560	The logic is much more about determinant thought content.
1071560	1074880	So we can replace this and make it
1074880	1079360	a more Hegelian-friendly point if we say not
1079360	1082520	that which is not self-contradictory thoughts,
1082520	1094520	but something like there are no thoughts that are not
1094520	1097800	f not f determinant.
1097800	1109240	That is to say, f not f marks a joint in logic,
1109240	1112080	where every thought has to be determinately
1112080	1114720	on some side of that.
1114720	1116520	Or another example would be, there
1116520	1122440	are no thoughts that are not subject predicate thoughts.
1122440	1134640	But maybe it is inaccurate to being because there
1134640	1151960	are true thoughts that are not f not f determinant
1151960	1155320	or, for example, not subject predicate judgments.
1158440	1161360	So that's more the level at which Hegel is thinking about it.
1161360	1164180	Once you've accepted that all thought as such
1164180	1168120	has a certain structure, you cannot then
1168120	1170040	play the skeptic and be like, but maybe
1170040	1172320	being self-structured like that, because that
1172320	1177560	is pretending to think that all thought
1177560	1181200	is structured a certain way, but certain thoughts that
1181200	1184360	are not structured that way are true or accurate
1184360	1185440	to the structure of each.
1185440	1187640	So at any point in the logic, you're like,
1187640	1189140	OK, maybe I have to think this way,
1189140	1191480	but why is being structured that way?
1191480	1193200	Just reapply this argument.
1193200	1196240	And if the argument of the logic has succeeded,
1196240	1200280	that whatever thought structure you're dealing with in the logic
1200280	1202840	has been imminently derived in such a way
1202840	1207000	that there's no way of doing without that.
1207000	1211520	These are not contingent thought contacts
1211520	1214960	that you can think according to or not as you wish.
1214960	1217400	They are the structure that thought just as such has to do.
1217400	1217920	Yeah.
1217920	1221920	When he says there are no thoughts, such and such,
1221920	1223120	what does there are means?
1223120	1225840	If it means that we just were incapable of taking
1225840	1227840	the thoughts, then that's to reduce the effect
1227840	1229640	of the sidewalk from the logic.
1229640	1231800	And if it means there aren't thoughts out there
1231800	1233120	in this problem, or one of them that
1233120	1235280	is already assuming some sort of sense of imperialism,
1235280	1239600	so it's kind of making questions of where you are.
1239600	1240800	OK, good.
1240800	1256400	How about thought as such cannot but think fill in the blank?
1256400	1259480	So then, what is a thought contact?
1259480	1261800	Something that thought as such can think,
1261800	1264200	not making any claims of a human thinking.
1264200	1267040	And if it's possible and logic to prove that thought just
1267040	1268880	as such has to think in certain ways,
1268880	1271400	then we're off to the risk.
1271400	1272400	OK, yeah?
1272400	1275360	Very simple question because I'm very confused.
1275360	1279800	So my mental activity, my psychological activity
1279800	1284280	of thinking in the normal sense, thinking there exists an exercise
1284280	1286640	that I'd be able to not recognize,
1286640	1290040	is that not the general decision that people recorded?
1290040	1291080	OK, yeah.
1291080	1294680	So your question puts, you're putting your finger
1294680	1297560	on the question, what is the relationship
1297560	1301120	between human thinking, an activity that
1301120	1304240	occurs in space and time, in particular
1304240	1308440	datable historical moment, have to think it
1308440	1311240	as the topic of the logic?
1311240	1314000	And that is not treated in the logic.
1314000	1316720	That is a thing that at some point in the system,
1316720	1319280	we have to figure that out.
1319280	1321480	We have to ask ourselves, at some point in the system,
1321480	1325080	wait, how do I fit into this?
1325080	1326640	I'm just a guy in Germany.
1329640	1330280	I'm finite.
1333120	1335960	I think sometimes I don't always think,
1335960	1338600	I haven't been thinking forever, I'm not going to think forever.
1338600	1340240	What is the relationship between thinking
1340240	1344800	in the psychological sense to thinking in the logical sense?
1344800	1347840	And that, of course, that's not just a question for Hegel.
1347840	1350480	That's a question for everyone who
1350480	1352880	is not the worst form of psychologist about logic.
1355800	1360560	What is the relationship between logic and psychology?
1360560	1362480	Or what is the bearing of logic on thinking
1362480	1364200	in the psychological sense?
1364200	1368320	And so if Hegel's system works out properly,
1368320	1370480	we're going to derive.
1370480	1372160	We don't yet have in science thinking
1372160	1375440	in the psychological sense as a topic.
1375440	1377400	So we have to derive that in science.
1378200	1381880	There's no who in the logic.
1381880	1386000	My view of it, your question is, who is thinking the logic?
1386000	1388960	Who is the subject of the thought of the logic?
1388960	1391360	Is this the thing that people have different views about?
1391360	1396400	My view is, that is not a topic of the logic.
1396400	1401760	That is to say, in logic, we ignore the identity
1401760	1404560	of the subject of thinking.
1404560	1409640	As we do in normal logic, take a logic class.
1409640	1411040	We now call them propositions.
1411040	1413240	But they're just contents of thinking.
1413240	1416000	If you then ask, well, what's the relationship
1416000	1417360	of this to my psychology?
1417360	1419720	Your logic teacher will say, this is not what we're doing.
1419720	1422160	I probably assume it's universal thinking.
1422160	1425520	But find me the logic textbook that
1425520	1429600	wasn't written in Germany in the 19th century that says,
1429600	1431400	intro logic.
1431400	1436440	The topic of this book is universal thinking.
1436440	1438900	Interestingly, there is one 19th century German
1438900	1440360	logician who says this.
1440360	1442120	And it's Frege.
1442120	1457080	In Der Gedanken, which is one of three essays
1457080	1459120	called The Logical Investigations that Frege
1459120	1463600	published late in life after Bertrand Russell had located
1463600	1468840	a paradox in and thus destroyed his Frege's life work, who
1468840	1471160	means that's the basic laws of arithmetic.
1471160	1472760	Frege wrote these three essays trying
1472760	1477240	to shore up what remained of his life's work in logic.
1477240	1481800	The thought, or thought, is the most interesting of them.
1481800	1487640	And he says in that essay that logic is not the study of minds
1487720	1490040	but of the mind.
1490040	1494520	This is a question that is not just about the mind.
1494520	1498280	So Frege, who's supposed to be and is
1498280	1502600	presented as the godfather of good analytic,
1502600	1506080	non-psychologistic logic as opposed to all this German
1506080	1510400	idealist bullshit, in one of the key documents,
1510400	1515720	says that logic is the science of the spirit, of spirit.
1515720	1518360	Not of spirits, but of the spirit.
1518360	1524440	That's a more psychologistic conception of logic than a godfather.
1524440	1527560	So that's another class that I'll someday teach.
1527560	1532480	Frege as bad German idealist.
1532480	1537120	Or why analytic philosophy is, in the Marxist sense,
1537120	1540840	a deviation of German idealism.
1540840	1542320	OK.
1542320	1544320	And then I'll be assassinated by you, Mr. Gritty.
1544320	1547800	OK.
1547800	1550600	So I just want to emphasize a few things,
1550600	1551960	because these are things that I'm
1551960	1555640	worried that you might get the wrong impression about.
1555640	1561240	One, logic is not about thinking in the psychological sense.
1561240	1565120	It's not about the activity of human beings thinking.
1565120	1569280	It's about what thinking just as such has to think.
1569280	1572560	It's about the content of thinking as such.
1572560	1575600	Hegel, unfortunately, just uses the word thought for that.
1575600	1579720	Now, that thought has this bad ambiguity.
1579720	1584440	It can be both Nick Stang's thought
1584440	1586960	and what Nick Stang thinks.
1586960	1589360	It's only the second sense in which we're interested,
1589360	1593920	the sense in which my thought can be exactly the same as yours.
1593920	1597080	And we're not interested in the identity of who
1597080	1598680	or what thinks these thoughts.
1598680	1600720	Yeah.
1600720	1606280	So that means, as Hegel says, page three of the handout,
1606280	1609520	instead of using the expression thoughts,
1609520	1612720	it would thus be better to speak of thought determinations
1612720	1615880	and to avoid any misunderstandings.
1615880	1617800	So what does that mean?
1617800	1621520	It means that in logic, we study the content of thought.
1621520	1624680	So what we study is what makes a thought
1624680	1628200	determinantly the thought it is, namely its content.
1628200	1630960	Or thoughts are individuated.
1630960	1633000	They are what they are in virtue of their content,
1633000	1635880	because what they are is thought content.
1635880	1638000	Now, he's not saying that everything thinks
1638000	1639760	or that everything is a thought.
1639760	1641280	The identity of being and thinking
1641280	1644080	must, however, not be taken in a concrete sense.
1644080	1647080	Hence, what is not to say that a stone that has being
1647080	1649320	is the same as a thinking human being.
1649320	1652480	He's not saying that a stone is a thought.
1652480	1658040	He's saying is there might be stones that we can never,
1658040	1660280	there's going to be facts about stones that human beings can
1660280	1662080	never know.
1662080	1663560	There might be physical objects that
1663560	1665400	are too distant for us to experience.
1665400	1667760	There may be physical objects that are too far in the past
1667760	1669640	for us to know about.
1669640	1674560	But nothing in being can be logically alien to us.
1674560	1678200	Everything has the structure of thought.
1678200	1679480	And since the structure of thought
1679480	1684360	is not these trivial, tautologous things,
1684360	1685920	like the principle of contradiction,
1685920	1688760	it's the very determinate, contentful structure
1688760	1691640	of the logic that is a metaphysics worth calling
1691640	1693560	the end.
1693560	1697080	So this science of just the content of what thought
1697080	1701080	as such as to think will also be the science of being just
1701080	1703520	as being or being or being the traditional definition
1703520	1706120	of metaphysics.
1706120	1710560	Now, everything that we do is a modification of thinking.
1710560	1714800	So willing is thinking about what to do or what is good,
1714800	1716360	what is choice worth.
1716360	1721120	Desiring also is thinking about what you want.
1721120	1724600	Perceiving is seeing what is the case.
1724600	1726720	The content of your perception is also
1726720	1727920	the content of a thought.
1727920	1734760	You see that the book is on the table.
1734760	1741520	Hegel thinks that the marker of thought content is is, is being.
1741520	1743920	So we don't just see objects.
1743920	1746680	We see that things are the case.
1746680	1752200	And so the content of perception is also the content of thought.
1752200	1755040	Thinking can appear to be just one capacity
1755040	1757640	of one kind of animals.
1757640	1759760	That's thinking in the psychological sense.
1759760	1762440	But it can't be just that.
1762440	1767240	If it were just that, if it were like human vision,
1767240	1770240	then the following we'd be coherent.
1770240	1773000	There is an object that we can think about.
1773000	1774760	There are objects that we can think about.
1774760	1777200	And there are objects we cannot think about.
1777200	1778680	Just as there are objects we can see
1778680	1780520	and there are objects we cannot see.
1780520	1784960	Or in Aristotelian terms, thought cannot be an organ.
1784960	1787520	Can't be one capacity among others
1787520	1792880	that has one characteristic object over others.
1792880	1798160	Anything that can be is the, and that
1798160	1800480	means that thinkable is transcendental,
1800480	1804040	not in the Kantian sense, but in the original sense
1804040	1809320	in which unity, truth, and goodness are transcendental.
1809320	1812560	This is traditional doctrine that all beings are one, true,
1812560	1814080	and good.
1814080	1817040	That oneness, truth, and goodness are
1817040	1820280	constitutive of any being.
1820280	1822400	And they're interconverted.
1822400	1825640	Thought is transcendental in something like that sense.
1825640	1828480	All beings just as such are thinkable,
1828480	1829960	and all thought is about being.
1832680	1837720	That's why the purported claim, or one
1837720	1840320	way to get at that point about the transcendental character
1840320	1843040	of thought is the claim there is something that cannot be
1843040	1845440	thought is self-undermining.
1845440	1847360	So if we think of the development
1847360	1850480	of transcendental philosophy after Kant
1850480	1856280	as trying to find a master notion such
1856280	1858000	that what we do in philosophy is we
1858000	1860520	study how that is possible.
1860520	1863200	And then there's nothing outside of that.
1863200	1867600	We can think, OK, in Kant in some way it's representation,
1867600	1870280	but representation is too broad.
1870280	1872240	It can't be cognition, because in Kant
1872240	1873480	there are things we can represent
1873480	1876680	that we can't cognize, et cetera, et cetera.
1876680	1882400	There are other possible candidates for the notion.
1882400	1884120	Some of them aren't going to work.
1884120	1889560	Like, for instance, Robert Pippin in his most recent book,
1889560	1893520	The Culmination, which is about Heidegger in relation
1893520	1897720	to German idealism, thinks Heidegger wins
1897720	1900520	because the thing that philosophy should really
1900520	1903000	be about is meaningfulness.
1903000	1905000	The Deutschland.
1905080	1909480	There's the small problem that that's not what being is.
1909480	1911760	All that taric decay makes that point.
1911760	1914160	But Beidouitzamkite, meaningfulness,
1914160	1918920	is not a plausible candidate for our fundamental access
1918920	1920800	to everything, because the following
1920800	1922920	is perfectly coherent.
1922920	1925120	There are things that are not meaningful to me.
1927960	1931640	So there's something beyond the realm of Beidouitzamkite.
1931640	1936200	So if we want to study the fundamental way in which
1936200	1940280	human beings are onto something, or about stuff,
1940280	1944960	or represent things, use Kantian terminology,
1944960	1947400	that which is meaningful to us is not a good starting point.
1947400	1949920	Because we can obviously be onto or intentionally
1949920	1953160	relate or represent or think about things that
1953160	1955120	are not meaningful to us.
1955120	1959160	There's a lot of stuff that's completely meaningless to me.
1959160	1960720	That sounded dark.
1960720	1967000	Whoops, like formal epistemology.
1967000	1970600	Completely devoid of Beidouitzamkite, but it has been.
1970600	1974400	The following, however, is self-underbinder.
1974400	1977120	There is something I cannot think about.
1977120	1980080	That means that a plausible case can
1980080	1983480	be made for why the fundamental notion
1983480	1987480	in transcendental philosophy, the thing that properly
1987480	1992400	describes human-mindedness relationship to anything
1992400	1999280	that it can be onto, is not meaningfulness but thinking.
1999280	2000160	OK.
2000160	2003480	Now thinking as the activation of a capacity in human beings
2003480	2007120	does not create, generate, et cetera, being.
2007120	2010880	It's not that being is a product of human thinking.
2010880	2013040	It's that any more than human thinking
2013040	2015840	is the product of the laws of logic.
2015840	2018520	It's that there's no thinkable distinction
2018520	2022200	between the structure of the content of thinking as such
2022200	2024400	and the structure of being.
2024400	2024920	OK.
2024920	2026920	Let me just, the first thing, the next thing
2026920	2034960	I'll go over very quickly is what Kantian logic does,
2034960	2037600	Hegelian logic correspond to.
2037600	2039760	In some sense, it's neither of them
2039760	2042600	because it isn't about a capacity or any capacities
2042600	2045320	of human mind.
2045320	2049400	On the one hand, it's more like transcendental logic
2049400	2054000	because it's about the content above.
2054000	2057640	But on the other hand, it's also more like pure general logic
2057640	2059800	because it's about the form of thinking.
2059800	2062600	But really, it's neither slash both of them
2062600	2065520	because in studying a form of thinking,
2065520	2068880	you also uncover all of its content.
2068880	2071520	So something like pure general logic and transcendental logic
2071520	2074640	become kind of the same for Hegel with the proviso
2074640	2077160	that they don't become the same because the content of thought
2077160	2079000	is provided by sensibility.
2079000	2082680	And this one logic, which is both transcendental and pure
2082680	2087600	general, is not about any capacities of the human mind.
2087600	2088440	OK.
2088440	2092560	Now furthermore, so the thing in Kant that most closely
2092560	2100400	corresponds to Hegelian logic is the metaphysical deduction
2100400	2105600	with the proviso that Hegel thinks of his deduction
2105600	2110640	of the categories of thought as more systematic or imminent than Kant's.
2110640	2112360	And there's no separation.
2112360	2115800	We don't first deduce all of the predidational forms of judgment
2115800	2117840	and then deduce the categories of thought.
2117840	2121000	The categories themselves are also predication forms.
2121000	2123640	So the first category of logic is being.
2123640	2126920	That's also the most basic form of predication is.
2126920	2129520	As we'll see next week, it's prior even to the distinction
2129520	2132080	between subject and predicate.
2132080	2138640	So each of the categories of the logic is also a kind of predication.
2138640	2140720	OK.
2140720	2143840	Skip the historical background.
2143840	2147280	A lot of this is not particularly important.
2147280	2147960	OK.
2147960	2150680	I'm going to skip the stuff about method
2150680	2153360	because it will come back in a couple of weeks.
2153360	2154360	OK.
2154360	2168240	So dialectic, remember, is originally in ancient philosophy
2168240	2172760	or in ancient philosophical practice the art of reputation.
2172760	2177840	It's how you, as they say on YouTube, destroy people.
2177840	2182080	That's all the YouTube videos of like Ben Shapiro destroys liberal.
2182080	2183080	That's all dialectic.
2183920	2186760	The worst possible dialectic, although Ben Shapiro
2186760	2191360	has an undergraduate degree in philosophy, I believe,
2191360	2196800	his parents should get a tuition, a reimbursement.
2196800	2197440	OK.
2197440	2199440	I mean, whatever, he's a sophist.
2199440	2201600	Sorry, I don't want to pick on Ben Shapiro.
2201600	2205280	Most so-called public intellectuals, most of public intellectual life
2205280	2207280	is just sophistry.
2207280	2212720	It's just using rhetorical skills to make the weaker argument to be stronger.
2212720	2218280	If you haven't figured this out already, this is some good news.
2218280	2222240	A philosophy education is the best possible education in sophistry.
2222240	2224440	We're not teaching you how to be sophists,
2224440	2229280	but we've given you all the skills necessary for maximal sophistry.
2229280	2232080	You've already probably figured this out.
2232080	2233840	Just with a little philosophical training,
2233840	2237080	you can win any argument with your friends
2237080	2241040	about things you know nothing about because you know as a philosopher,
2241040	2244520	you just immediately move the terrain onto something
2244520	2247000	where knowledge doesn't matter.
2247000	2249600	And then the classic philosophy move is to be like, well,
2249600	2251680	I don't know what that means.
2251680	2253960	And now what you've done is you just all their knowledge
2253960	2257480	has now been made irrelevant because they actually know what it means.
2257480	2259600	And you're like, I don't know.
2259600	2264840	So this is also why philosophy is the best possible preparation for law
2264840	2266760	school.
2266760	2270920	So you have all the skills necessary to be a really, really successful
2270960	2272680	YouTube sophist.
2272680	2276800	I hope you don't do that with your philosophy training.
2276800	2279080	So that's what dialectic is originally.
2283640	2287080	Hegel praises Kant's transcendental dialect.
2287080	2289080	In particular, the Antinomies, he doesn't really
2289080	2290280	care about the rest of the dialectic.
2290280	2292360	He always identifies the dialect with the Antinomies.
2292360	2295040	Because what Kant discovered is that there's
2295040	2299280	a dialectic built into reason itself.
2299280	2303280	That is to say, reason itself generates these contradictions.
2303280	2311680	The problem is that Kant was too freaked out by his own discovery
2311680	2314320	and thought, oh, what that shows is we better not
2314320	2317480	try to cognize the unconditioned in things
2317480	2319320	themselves using the categories.
2319320	2320960	Instead, what he should have realized
2320960	2324720	is that the categories in their fixed determinant relationships
2324720	2327720	to one another generate contradictions.
2327720	2332480	That's the dialectic of the categories themselves.
2332480	2337960	Just those concepts themselves dialectically undermine themselves.
2337960	2342800	Now, Hegel's conception of dialectic is not,
2342800	2346080	as we saw in the phenomenology, is not just negative.
2346080	2349640	It's not just that some set of categories
2349640	2352600	generate contradictions and therefore undermine themselves.
2352600	2356560	It also generates, it's also positive, it's also generated.
2356560	2359360	It generates new categories.
2359360	2362760	And Hegel's name for this kind of philosophy
2362760	2367560	or this kind of logic, which works by uncovering,
2367560	2370920	makes it sound like we're doing something.
2370920	2373720	But I'm going to say it anyways.
2373720	2377000	Uncovering contradictions or letting concepts contradict
2377000	2382800	themselves and then resolve that contradict in a higher concept
2382800	2384280	is he calls that speculative.
2387320	2393480	So another way of putting that is Hegel's logic is speculative.
2393480	2398280	That doesn't mean it's speculative in the way of like,
2398280	2401880	we don't have really good evidence for what happens
2401880	2404960	10 to the minus seconds after the Big Bang,
2404960	2406560	but this kind of seems right.
2406560	2408840	It's not tentative.
2408840	2413680	It works by thought context and contradicting themselves
2413680	2418840	and something resolving that contradiction.
2418840	2421040	It is in this dialectic as understood here,
2421040	2423720	and hence in grasping opposites in their unity
2423720	2428080	or the positive in the negative that the speculative consists.
2428080	2432600	So that's a foreshadowing of the nature of the contradictions
2432600	2435920	that will arise in the logic.
2435920	2437360	The nature of the contradictions that
2437360	2442960	will arise in the logic is you have two categories that
2442960	2446000	are defined, or what they are, they're
2446000	2455280	determinately what they are through their difference
2455280	2456600	from one another.
2456600	2459880	One category in the marriage.
2459880	2462680	This is the negation of C1.
2462680	2465760	This is the negation of C2.
2465840	2471280	But it will also prove to be the case that they are the same.
2471280	2474880	So I have categories that are defined through their difference
2474880	2476760	like one and many, and then we'll
2476760	2479760	turn out that the one is many and the many is one.
2479760	2482760	That's a contradiction.
2482760	2486720	Now the hard thing will be to see how you resolve that,
2486720	2489400	because it can't be us being like, oh, I
2489400	2491120	have an idea how to resolve that.
2491120	2492120	That would be external.
2492120	2494160	It would be insufficiently imminent.
2494160	2497760	Somehow the contradiction has to resolve itself,
2497760	2499880	or just the thought contents themselves
2499880	2501720	have to resolve the contradiction that they
2501720	2502640	themselves are.
2507280	2513000	So as Hegel says, it is thinking that causes the wound
2513000	2514800	and heals it too.
2514800	2520920	So thinking causes its own contradictions and resolves it.
2520920	2522840	But while going about its business,
2522840	2524960	it so happens that thinking becomes
2524960	2527360	entangled in contradictions.
2527360	2531920	It loses itself in the fixed non-identity of its thoughts.
2531920	2532720	That's what this.
2532720	2535800	These things are what they are because of what they are not.
2538800	2540960	It loses itself in the fixed non-identity of its thoughts
2540960	2542800	and in the process does not attain itself,
2542800	2545080	but instead remains caught up in its opposite.
2545080	2546520	The higher aspiration of thinking
2546520	2549160	goes against this result produced by thinking satisfied
2549160	2551240	with merely understanding.
2551240	2555240	So this structure, where a concept is what
2555240	2558200	it is through its negative relationship to something else,
2558200	2561600	is what Hegel identifies as the understanding.
2566360	2578000	Now, he, along with Kant, he acknowledges a difference
2578000	2580000	between understanding and reason.
2581480	2593800	But he thinks Kantian reason, Kantian fernund,
2593800	2598440	is also locked at this level.
2598440	2604240	Because Kantian reason just seeks conditions
2604240	2607840	for given conditioned objects where those conditioning
2607840	2610880	relations are defined through the categories, which
2611000	2616960	are themselves fixed in determinant identity.
2616960	2619600	So this is all Kantian.
2619600	2624520	This is all what Hegel would call understanding
2624520	2626760	or what Kant would call reason, including
2626760	2628760	what Kant would call understanding.
2633560	2637840	Or another way of putting this is
2637840	2641360	what Hegel calls understanding, subsumes Kantian understanding
2641360	2644560	and Kantian reason.
2644560	2652120	Hegelian reason is what resolves the contradiction.
2657720	2661240	So this is purely negative, or the negative dialectic.
2668840	2675320	Now, that means, although the logic is not about understanding
2675320	2680040	and reason, we can correlate what's
2680040	2685640	going on in the logic with these mental capacities.
2685640	2687760	So once again, we have to always distinguish.
2687760	2691840	Hegel is not, he doesn't just talk
2691840	2694080	about the topics of one science in the book
2694080	2695440	that that science is about.
2695440	2696840	He also talks about other things.
2696840	2699120	And so you have to be careful to separate them.
2699120	2701040	So these reasons of understanding
2701040	2703920	are not properly logical topics.
2703920	2707160	These are anticipations of his conception
2707160	2710160	of the capacities of spirit, the capacities of the mind.
2714680	2719960	I'm going to skip that and talk about with what
2719960	2722640	must the beginning of science be made.
2722640	2726720	Questions up to this point.
2726720	2727220	Yes.
2730000	2736080	So if you know P, then you know about the world.
2736080	2740840	But our knowledge is perception, our perception,
2740840	2744080	and our subject is perception.
2744080	2751400	So how do we can say if we know P, and P is not perception?
2751400	2754800	OK, so I think you're running together
2754800	2757880	two different parts of the Hegelian story.
2757880	2764560	So not everything we know is through perception,
2764560	2768080	because the contents of logic is not something
2768080	2770880	that we can perceive.
2770880	2776520	However, what we can perceive is thinkable content.
2776520	2779560	Therefore, it has the logical structure
2779560	2781760	that will be uncovered in the logic.
2781760	2784520	You perceive determinate beings.
2784560	2786840	You perceive them as having qualities.
2786840	2789120	You perceive them as being one and many.
2789120	2791520	You perceive them as quantitatively determinate.
2791520	2793720	You perceive them as being measurable.
2793720	2796040	You perceive a difference between how they are
2796040	2798440	and how they appear to you under certain circumstances,
2798440	2800120	et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
2800120	2803760	So the deep logical structure of the content of perception
2803760	2807560	is also provided in the logic, but the topic of the logic
2807560	2811360	is not that content qua perceivable.
2811360	2813520	OK, yes.
2813520	2818400	You said that if you don't want to be like a psychological,
2818400	2820560	if you want to make logic entirely psychological,
2820560	2823440	then you have to accept.
2823440	2826880	But surely the psychological alternative
2826880	2828440	is like the elephant in the room.
2828440	2831640	That's the one that I would go to naturally
2831640	2833440	if I was a skeptic.
2833440	2836520	So should I just read the phenomenology of spirit?
2836520	2840280	I think that's Hegel's considered answer.
2840280	2842840	What he kind of says in the introduction is,
2842840	2847240	yeah, go study with Frese and stop bugging me.
2847240	2849800	That is to say, I think Hegel just in the introduction
2849800	2853600	just has no time for that view.
2853600	2862360	So Frese is this guy who he's like a Kantian,
2862360	2865080	but he thinks that Kant's transcendental philosophy
2865080	2867120	is psychology.
2867120	2872280	And Hegel has nothing but contempt for that view.
2872280	2874760	There's a great book about, so one
2874760	2877280	of the things that happens over the course of the 19th century
2877280	2880360	is German philosophers periodically go back to Kant
2880360	2883400	and are like, wait, all the answers were here all along.
2883400	2884400	Let's just do this.
2884400	2886700	Let's forget about this fifth The Schelling Hegel stuff.
2886700	2888280	It's incomprehensible.
2888280	2892480	And maybe it's falsified by natural science.
2892480	2894840	There's a great book about the whole thing
2894840	2898720	by Fred Beiser called The Genesis of Neocontinism.
2898720	2903560	And that book is basically the history of Kantians being like,
2903560	2905960	oh, let's make this all about psychology.
2905960	2908800	And then at some point, they're like, wait.
2908800	2911480	If it's all about psychology, then it's just
2911480	2913400	about stuff in space and time.
2913400	2916080	And so it can't explain how knowledge in space and time
2916080	2917840	is possible.
2917840	2919280	And then they're like, oh, I'm not
2919280	2920560	sure what to do about that.
2920560	2922920	So it has this slightly dissatisfying quality
2922920	2924320	of you can see the problem coming
2924320	2926600	a million times, a million miles away,
2926600	2928100	and then all of these 19th century
2928100	2930200	psychologists and neocontians eventually
2930200	2932200	figure out the thing that was obvious on page one.
2932200	2932680	Yeah?
2932680	2934000	Maybe you'll get to this later.
2934000	2936800	What's then the upshot of me just sitting here
2936800	2939080	doing regular metaphysics?
2939080	2940720	What's the upshot?
2940720	2943120	For Kant, it becomes we're not talking about things
2943120	2944480	in themselves.
2944480	2947040	Is there an analogous thing for Hegel?
2947040	2949160	Oh, you mean what does Hegel think
2949160	2951800	you're doing if you're just doing spinosistic metaphysics?
2951800	2953720	Sure.
2953720	2958480	I think he thinks you are thinking,
2958480	2960440	but you're not thinking purely.
2960440	2963000	So some of the content of your thought
2963000	2965200	will be pure thought content.
2965200	2967920	And it will get something about the structure of metaphysics
2967920	2968520	right.
2968520	2970360	But it won't be scientific.
2970360	2976000	And so it will be a kind of aggregate of genuinely content
2976000	2979000	that genuinely reveals the metaphysical structure of being
2979000	2982640	and then just kind of your opinions and weird stuff.
2982680	2986880	And so because of his commitments
2986880	2990560	in the philosophy of history, we have to be able to,
2990560	2993240	if everything Hegel says is true,
2993240	2995800	then the content of the science of logic
2995800	2998560	has to be findable in the history of philosophy.
2998560	3000440	So in principle, we should be able to go back
3000440	3001960	through the history of philosophy
3001960	3008640	and find all of this stuff kind of exploded.
3008640	3010640	It's like there's a logical explosion.
3010640	3017200	And all of the shrapnel, all of the broken shards
3017200	3020040	of the logic bomb have been spread over time.
3020040	3023880	And this sounds very Dr. Who, but the history of philosophy
3023880	3027400	is like finding all of them and then reassembling them
3027400	3030440	into Hegelian logic as a confirmation
3030440	3032480	that we were right about the whole thing.
3032480	3032980	Yeah?
3032980	3035200	What about what's happening now?
3035200	3039360	Well, that's a really good question, actually.
3039360	3041200	It's actually a very hard question,
3041200	3043920	which is, what does Hegel think about the future?
3043920	3047160	And he doesn't say anything about it.
3047160	3048900	And so some people think that means Hegel
3048900	3050720	thinks there's no real future.
3050720	3051840	It's all just this.
3051840	3053040	Like, we're done.
3053040	3056240	And we can just repeat it.
3056240	3058880	That would be very disappointing.
3058880	3061680	Some people think that shows that Hegel thinks the future is
3061680	3064360	radically open.
3064360	3066840	That's ridiculous.
3066840	3067760	That's not worth it.
3067840	3070560	I can't even believe that I have to listen to people say that.
3070560	3072920	That would mean that the Hegel system has an outside,
3072920	3075160	or there's some stuff that's outside, which would mean,
3075160	3078720	OK, it's incoherent at every level.
3078720	3080600	The thing that people are primarily
3080600	3083480	concerned with about the Hegel future question
3083480	3088840	is not logical or metaphysics, but his philosophy of right.
3088840	3090720	Because those will see we get to the philosophy of right.
3090720	3093040	Hegel says in the preface of the philosophy of right,
3093040	3097720	something that seems to say, not we've come to the final form,
3097720	3100880	but I can only just describe this
3100880	3104000	because the social system that I'm describing is dead.
3104000	3105800	It's on its way out.
3105800	3108520	But then what's next?
3108520	3110760	And Hegel doesn't say, and the philosophy of history
3110760	3113960	seems to say that there kind of shouldn't be a next, better
3113960	3114840	social form.
3114840	3117120	So it's really hard to square those two.
3117120	3118480	There is a genuine question moment
3118480	3121080	to say about the future.
3121080	3125600	Now, my own view is like, your question gets to the question
3125600	3131800	of what happened to philosophy after classical German
3131800	3132320	idealism?
3135960	3140480	And how do you answer that question as a German idealist?
3140480	3145200	Because from the German idealist perspective, philosophy,
3145200	3147600	even if you're not a Hegelian, philosophy
3147600	3150400	kind of stopped after Hegel.
3150400	3153160	So Schelling lives much longer than Hegel,
3153160	3157280	and is actually brought to Hegel by the King of Prussia
3157280	3159960	to take over what is the Ministry of Education,
3159960	3163960	to take over Hegel's chair in philosophy in Berlin
3163960	3167920	to combat the specter of Hegelianism,
3167920	3170680	because Germans took philosophy really seriously.
3170680	3173760	And then so the everyday hall Schelling out of,
3173760	3175960	everyone thinks Schelling is dead,
3175960	3178000	and he looks like he's dead, but he's still alive.
3178800	3184680	Yes, something happens to philosophy
3184680	3189120	from the golden age of classical German philosophy to today,
3189120	3194080	and people vary in their reactions to it.
3194080	3197120	If you're a committed German idealist, especially
3197120	3198400	if you're a Hegelian, you really have
3198400	3200200	to think that a lot of what happened after Hegel
3200200	3202720	wasn't philosophy.
3202720	3205400	Or at least it wasn't moving the ball forward.
3205480	3208600	It's a repetition of previous things.
3208600	3213720	Now, does that confirm Hegel's philosophy of history,
3213720	3216160	or his philosophy of history of philosophy?
3216160	3218160	Does it refute it?
3218160	3220240	We'll talk about that when we get there.
3220240	3224200	And I don't want to, I've already
3224200	3227160	shown too much of my hand about my own views about these things
3227160	3231360	that I don't want to give you a lecture on the trappitude
3231360	3233160	of philosophy since the death of Hegel.
3233160	3234800	OK, I realize there are other questions,
3234840	3238280	but I also need to get to the question of,
3238280	3243160	with what must the beginning of science be made?
3243160	3245800	OK, so once again, on the handout,
3245800	3251440	I've outlined the structure, as I interpret it, of this section.
3251440	3253520	It starts out with some introductory remarks
3253520	3256720	about the general question of the problem of the beginning
3256720	3259600	in philosophy, and then it gets an exposition
3259600	3263040	of the beginning of the science a lot, the pure science.
3263040	3264640	And then there's some further reflections,
3264640	3267160	and there's a discussion in Fitbit and other post-contients,
3267160	3268800	which I will skip.
3268800	3271280	OK, so the first three paragraphs
3271280	3275680	introduce the theme of, what is the beginning of philosophy?
3275680	3277360	Where that can be understood either
3277360	3280040	as an ontological or metaphysical beginning, what
3280040	3282280	is the first principle?
3282280	3285720	Or an epistemological or methodological beginning?
3285720	3288320	What is our access to that first principle?
3288320	3291440	How do we methodologically begin in philosophy?
3291440	3294600	Now, this essay is a response to,
3294600	3300640	it's an outgrowth of an incredible methodological,
3300640	3305680	a series of interventions in German philosophy
3305680	3309840	between Kant and Hegel that become extremely
3309840	3312720	methodologically self-conscious about what philosophy is
3312720	3318400	and how to do it, that I won't go into now.
3318400	3321000	So the project of science of logic, of course,
3321080	3324720	is to unfold from thought itself the determinations of thought.
3324720	3329880	So the beginning of logic is the first category or thought
3329880	3332400	determination of logic.
3332400	3338000	So the real question here is, what do we begin logically?
3338000	3342720	Now, should the beginning be immediate,
3342720	3345800	or should it be immediate?
3345800	3349480	Now, Hegel begins by telling us that it
3349480	3353040	can be neither immediate nor immediate,
3353040	3354880	but then goes on immediately to say
3354880	3357880	that it is both immediate and immediate.
3357880	3362040	He says, in fact, that everything under heaven
3362040	3365560	and on Earth is both immediate and immediate.
3365560	3368440	So we have to understand what that means.
3368440	3372040	So I think the mistake is assuming
3372040	3375800	that if something is immediate, it isn't immediate and vice
3375800	3380600	versa, because if that were the case,
3380600	3383680	then the claim that everything was immediate and immediate
3383680	3384840	would be a contradiction.
3384840	3386280	And it wouldn't be a contradiction
3386280	3388440	that, so to speak, Hegel takes away or revolves.
3388440	3391840	It would just be left with a contradiction.
3391840	3394880	So what do we mean by mediation?
3394880	3398840	Now, there's at least three senses of mediation
3398840	3401000	that are relevant.
3401000	3405680	What I call on the handout, metaphysical mediation,
3405800	3409520	epistemic mediation, and semantic mediation.
3409520	3413960	And the idea of mediation, I'm looking for the definition,
3413960	3416600	I put a note about the definition of mediation
3416600	3420120	in the encyclopedias, but I won't find it in a moment.
3420120	3420960	Here it is.
3420960	3424920	This is page 40 in the encyclopediologic reading.
3424920	3426160	I'll just read it out loud.
3426160	3427680	It's a very short sentence.
3427680	3430840	Mediation means to make a beginning
3430840	3433440	and then to have proceeded to a second item,
3434360	3438000	such that this second item is the way it is only
3438000	3442520	insofar as one has arrived at it by starting with something
3442520	3444960	that is an other over against it.
3444960	3448720	So mediation means there's two things,
3448720	3452560	and one of them is arrived at by means of,
3452560	3455720	and is therefore distinct from, the other.
3455720	3459640	So metaphysical mediation would be something like x,
3459640	3462240	one thing is in virtue of another,
3462240	3464360	or it ontologically depends upon another,
3464360	3467120	or as we now say is grounded in another.
3467120	3470840	Epistemic mediation would be knowing something
3470840	3472840	by means of knowing something else.
3473720	3476640	The classic example would be inferring something
3476640	3478160	from something else.
3478160	3481240	And semantic mediation would be that something
3481240	3484920	has its meaning, or is the content it is,
3484920	3486680	in virtue of its relation to something else.
3486680	3488720	That would be something like a definition.
3489720	3494400	So bachelor is semantically mediated by unmarried.
3495320	3498440	If these two concepts are defined in relation
3498440	3501440	to one another, they're mutually mediated.
3503240	3505680	Now what would a presupposition be?
3505680	3508720	It would be something that isn't mediated by something else.
3508720	3510480	So a metaphysi, sorry, it would be something
3510480	3512440	that is mediated by something else.
3512440	3516280	So something is a metaphysical presupposition
3516280	3517880	if it grounds something else.
3518040	3520920	It's an epistemic presupposition
3520920	3523000	if it allows you to know something.
3523000	3524640	It's a semantic presupposition
3524640	3527120	if it allows you to define something else.
3527120	3529680	So if something were presuppositionless,
3529680	3532440	it would have to be metaphysically ungrounded,
3532440	3535880	epistemically immediate, and semantically immediate.
3535880	3540880	Okay, now what is the relevant notion of mediation,
3541040	3542840	and therefore beginning for Hegel?
3543760	3548760	Well, in some sense, one and three are identical in the lot.
3550360	3555360	Because we know something by means
3556080	3558560	of its semantic relationships
3558560	3560560	of some other thought content.
3560560	3565160	A thought content is what it is via its semantic relations.
3565160	3568560	So semantic and metaphysical dependency go together
3568560	3571880	with one another with respect to things
3571920	3574920	that are essentially semantic, essentially thought contents.
3574920	3578120	And likewise, in the logic, we would assume
3578120	3582120	that we know things via that which defines them.
3583040	3585280	But I wanna focus on the third
3585280	3589780	because we're focused on thought contents.
3590920	3594400	Okay, so the project of the logic has to be,
3594400	3597760	means that we have to begin with an immediate thought content.
3597760	3599280	The first category of the logic
3599280	3601000	has to be an immediate thought context
3601000	3604280	because the project is to unfold all the contents
3604280	3606500	of thinking from thinking itself.
3606500	3609700	If it began with a thought content A
3609700	3612240	that was semantically mediated by something else B,
3612240	3614440	that is to say, it was the thought content
3614440	3616920	and it was via B or was defined in terms of B,
3617920	3619540	then we should have started with B.
3619540	3621680	B would be the true beginning of the logic.
3622820	3627820	Okay, so we need a immediate beginning for the logic.
3627980	3630820	Immediate beginning for the logic.
3630820	3632380	So the beginning of the logic
3632380	3634220	has to be an immediate thought content.
3635300	3640300	Okay, so, Hegel gives a little argument at 21.55
3643380	3648060	for what the beginning of logic should be.
3649700	3651160	This is,
3654220	3655060	is it 25.55?
3658580	3661900	So it's actually 25.56.
3661900	3664780	It's basically the paragraph that begins,
3664780	3667980	being is what makes the beginning here and then ends,
3667980	3669780	the beginning is there for a pure being.
3671820	3674860	But I think actually we can just skip most of that paragraph
3674860	3677220	and just focus on the last two sentences,
3677220	3679020	which I have on the handout.
3679020	3681220	Just as it cannot have any determination
3681220	3684100	with respect to another, the beginning,
3684100	3686500	so to it cannot have any within it.
3686500	3688620	It cannot have any content,
3688620	3691180	or any content would entail distinction
3691180	3693700	and the reference of distinct moments to each other
3693700	3695680	and hence a mediation.
3695680	3699660	The beginning is therefore pure being.
3699660	3700960	Okay, so here's my reconstruction
3700960	3702740	of how Hegel is reasoning there.
3704260	3705860	The beginning has to be immediate.
3707060	3710260	If it were determined, that is to say,
3710260	3712220	we're either internally determined,
3712220	3716060	it has parts that are determined with respect to another,
3716060	3717580	or if it was determinate with respect
3717580	3720220	to something distinct from it, it would be immediate.
3721580	3722940	Why?
3722940	3727420	Because determinacy, to be a specific determinate thing,
3728500	3730580	requires not being something else.
3733500	3737260	And determinacy is a, sorry,
3739460	3744460	this is slightly less precise than I would have liked.
3746300	3751300	Let me just articulate this, okay.
3757620	3760620	So the beginning must be immediate.
3769500	3772140	Because if it were not, that which mediates it
3772140	3773620	would be a true beginning.
3773620	3778620	If it is immediate, then it is indeterminate.
3790900	3791740	Why?
3792860	3797860	Because determinacy entails negation.
3801660	3802500	Why?
3802500	3806380	Because determinacy is to be one thing
3806380	3807780	rather than something else.
3809220	3812700	And that requires not being or negation.
3812700	3815700	Or in other words, Hegel is appealing to
3816940	3818500	the Spittisist principle,
3819500	3821140	omnis determinatio,
3823460	3824420	as negatio.
3824420	3829420	Okay, this appears in letter 50
3834460	3838060	of Spinoza to a guy named Jorig Yellis.
3838060	3841620	So if you want your name to live in eternity,
3841620	3844060	and you don't think you have it in you
3844060	3846140	to write one of the great works
3846140	3847780	of the history of philosophy,
3847780	3849940	make sure that one of the great philosophers
3849940	3851500	of all time writes you a letter.
3852380	3854620	And then for now until eternity,
3856700	3859660	people will mention your name.
3859660	3862220	Jorig Yellis, lost history.
3862220	3865300	I mention this guy's name in like every class I teach.
3865300	3866660	He will live forever.
3866660	3867740	Is it not letter 50?
3867740	3869060	No, it is, I have a question.
3869060	3870140	Oh, you know, sorry.
3870140	3871060	Okay, no.
3874820	3877660	Spinoza doesn't put the word omnisig.
3877660	3879500	That's an interpolation.
3879500	3880740	I think it's interpretively correct.
3880820	3883180	I think it's very clear in context.
3883180	3885780	He doesn't just say determination is negation.
3887700	3889780	He means all determination is negation.
3891100	3891940	Okay.
3893180	3897300	So the beginning has to be completely indeterminate.
3898540	3902060	Okay, that is to say if it's completely indeterminate,
3904740	3906620	if something isn't something else,
3906620	3908060	it's also determinate.
3908060	3909500	It's not that thing.
3909820	3912340	It's not just that determinacy entails negation.
3912340	3913900	They're the same.
3913900	3915980	So the beginning of logic has to be
3915980	3917860	not only completely indeterminate,
3917860	3919180	but completely non-negated.
3920700	3923660	What is pure science about?
3923660	3926780	It's about the content of things.
3926780	3927900	What does thought think about?
3927900	3928940	It talks about being.
3930020	3932740	So the first category of the logic
3932740	3937740	has to be completely indeterminate, non-negated being.
3937980	3941380	Completely indeterminate, immediacy.
3941380	3943460	That is to say it's not a thought about this being
3943460	3947820	or that being, this kind of being, this way of being.
3947820	3949460	It's just being.
3951740	3955140	Or as Hegel sometimes characterizes it, purity.
3956460	3959140	That means there's a thematic connection
3959140	3962660	between the beginning of the logic and sense certainty.
3962660	3964860	So one of the things we'll eventually have to talk about
3964860	3966860	is what exactly is the relationship
3966900	3969540	between the beginning of logic and sense certainty.
3969540	3972580	And I am not entirely sure what I think about that.
3972580	3973420	Hojo and then you.
3973420	3976500	Yes, so premise one, would you say it's descriptive
3976500	3977460	or is it normative?
3977460	3979540	And also is premise one itself a first principle
3979540	3981700	or is it further justified?
3981700	3984220	It's further justified because what we're doing here,
3984220	3985660	we're not doing logic yet.
3985660	3987660	All of these are external remarks
3987660	3990780	because none of this stuff has been derived in logic.
3990780	3994020	We're all just kind of fancy-footin'.
3994020	3996100	This is all just like, you know.
3997460	4000420	Hegel's like, it's not that he doesn't want to start sign
4000420	4001740	pure thinking.
4001740	4005580	It's like he's delaying the beginning of as long as possible
4005580	4008140	so that you have as much preparation as possible
4008140	4011580	before we dive right in and think purity.
4011580	4012420	Yes.
4012420	4013580	Two questions.
4013580	4016380	So can we say negation is pure supposition,
4016380	4018940	this is first, and the second question,
4018940	4020820	the beginning is pure being.
4021820	4026660	Can we say the pure being is I and I is perception?
4026660	4030220	No, no I, no perception.
4030220	4031940	However, there is a connection
4031940	4035460	because the first principle of fixtus philosophy is I
4035460	4038620	and Hegel thinks that's just as indeterminate
4038620	4040140	as pure being.
4040140	4041860	And so fixtus to be congratulated
4041860	4044140	with a completely indeterminate starting point.
4044140	4049140	But A, it's not absolute
4049300	4051740	because being an I or being a subject,
4051740	4054540	it's defined through what it isn't,
4054540	4055460	namely the object.
4055460	4057580	So we're not yet at a completely presuppositionless
4057580	4059020	or absolute starting point.
4059020	4064020	And the way fixtus system of philosophy works,
4064700	4065940	when we start with that starting point,
4065940	4067700	we can't get any further.
4067700	4070420	And Hegel thinks his system is set up in such a way
4070420	4073060	that we can get further than purity.
4073060	4073900	Yeah.
4073900	4075620	Oh sorry, okay, yeah.
4075620	4079100	So can we say negation is pure supposition?
4079700	4081620	I don't wanna go so far as to say
4081620	4084740	that negation and presupposition are always the same thing.
4084740	4087260	If I presuppose something,
4087260	4090940	then there's what's being presupposed
4090940	4094300	and what that presupposition supports, so to speak,
4094300	4095620	what's supposed.
4095620	4097500	There's the supposition and the presupposition.
4097500	4098900	They have to be different.
4098900	4100580	And so they have to be determinate
4100580	4101620	with respect to one another.
4101620	4104640	So wherever there's presupposition, there is negation.
4104640	4107020	I wouldn't wanna go so far as to say that negation
4107500	4109940	always involves presupposition of all being.
4109940	4111140	Yeah.
4111140	4114940	So far, in the short argument for idealism
4114940	4118700	or for thought, has it come from being kind of
4118700	4122180	as like the assumption of our collection of all being?
4122180	4125140	I didn't, that's your interpretation, I didn't say that.
4125140	4126260	Okay.
4126260	4128380	Being is definitely not a collection of all being.
4128380	4130700	Because then being would be a being.
4130700	4132300	And there would be the following question.
4132300	4133940	Is there a being beyond that collection?
4133940	4136820	Namely, a being beyond being, and that's incoherent.
4137460	4139260	Except, I should know there are all these people.
4139260	4144260	There's this tradition, as some of you know very well,
4144340	4145940	of thinking that the form of the good
4145940	4148060	in play that would be beyond being.
4148060	4149060	So it's not a being.
4150100	4153300	I can't really make any sense of that.
4153300	4154660	Yeah, how do you think?
4154660	4158420	So is immediacy related to your own collection?
4158420	4162140	And what does immediacy, immediacy, distinction
4162140	4164660	relate to at the beginning?
4164700	4166940	They're related, but they're not identical.
4166940	4171580	So if there's a condition and a condition,
4171580	4174300	then they're distinct and they're determinate
4174300	4176100	partly in relation to one another.
4176100	4178420	To be a condition is to be the condition
4178420	4180860	of some condition, which you are not.
4180860	4183940	To be a condition just to be conditioned by something,
4183940	4186020	to have a condition that you are not.
4186020	4188140	So those are determinate and they have all negation.
4188140	4191500	But not all determinacy negation relations
4191500	4192900	are conditioning relations.
4192900	4195900	Because a conditioning relation is asymmetric.
4195900	4197540	So I don't think it's right to say
4197540	4199660	that these condition relationships.
4199660	4202500	So conditioning relations, asymmetric relations
4202500	4205860	of ontological dependence, become the topic of the logic.
4205860	4207900	They don't start out as the topic of the logic.
4207900	4210100	They're the topic of the doctrine of essence,
4210100	4213100	the second of the third parts of the logic.
4213100	4214220	Yes?
4214220	4215700	Can you just say that the beginning
4215700	4217900	of being immediate and distinguish
4217900	4221900	from the immediate is therefore just a meaning?
4221900	4224980	That is exactly the problem that we'll talk about next week.
4224980	4227780	That is the problem on which the entire Hegelian enterprise
4227780	4230460	potentially falters.
4230460	4233060	And everyone's been worried about this
4233060	4235900	since Schelling, his former college roommate,
4235900	4238500	was kind enough to point this out in public.
4238500	4238980	Yes?
4238980	4241300	So we haven't actually started the science of logic
4241300	4242060	problem yet.
4242060	4242780	No.
4242780	4244140	You have not thought purely yet.
4244140	4244660	No.
4244660	4245660	So we start presumable.
4245660	4247420	I know that was not meant personally.
4247420	4249860	For all I know, you think you're real.
4249860	4254020	So we start with being pure being in the actual science of logic.
4254020	4258420	So this argument doesn't really serve any purpose
4258420	4260940	besides to convince ourselves as the reader that OK.
4260940	4261440	Yes.
4261440	4261940	Yes.
4266940	4270420	What exactly is the problem of needing a beginning?
4270420	4272220	I think I just lost a step.
4272220	4273940	OK.
4273940	4275820	We want to do pure science.
4275820	4279020	Yeah.
4279020	4280060	We have to start somewhere.
4280060	4280540	Yeah.
4282940	4286660	The starting point has to be scientifically determined.
4286660	4288180	It can't be arbitrary.
4288180	4290780	Because if it were arbitrary, where we get
4290780	4292820	might depend on where we started.
4292820	4295660	And if where we get is arbitrary, if it's just like,
4295660	4298860	this is a plausible starting point, then where we get might be arbitrary.
4298860	4300420	And that it wouldn't be scientific.
4300420	4302920	OK.
4302920	4303420	Yes.
4306060	4307820	Hagle have any friends?
4307820	4309820	Sorry.
4309820	4310320	Yes.
4310320	4311820	He was actually a super fun guy.
4311820	4314820	Well, if it's on contemporaries, they're thinking of empirical scientists.
4314820	4320140	We're talking about absolute knowledge.
4320140	4323460	Were there any empirical scientists who went, hey, there's something in this
4323460	4324460	that we ought to know about?
4324460	4324940	Yes.
4324940	4327500	But I don't know enough about it.
4327500	4332820	So Hagle is intimately acquainted with and involved
4332820	4335100	with the empirical natural science of his day.
4335100	4338420	Knows it as well as it's possible for anyone
4338420	4340940	to know all of the sciences of the 19th century.
4340940	4344100	And in fact, what's the main thing that Hagle
4344100	4348500	does in the second edition of The Doctrine and Being?
4348500	4351820	It's not addressed the problem about the beginning of the logic
4351820	4354020	that everyone has been worried about.
4354020	4355740	He seems to think there's no problem.
4355740	4357980	So either there's no problem or Hagle is the worst
4357980	4360460	philosopher of the 19th century.
4360460	4362380	What does he primarily do?
4362420	4368420	He massively updates the treatment of calculus in The Doctrine and Being.
4368420	4374060	So there's this enormous digression about the mathematics of the infinite
4374060	4376180	in the first half of the science of logic.
4376180	4377820	Here's the problem.
4377820	4381100	Historical mathematics is weird.
4381100	4384260	The calculus you learned in your calculus class
4384260	4389860	is cleaned up post-Vierstrass, post-Dedekind presentations of calculus.
4389860	4394380	When you read historical calculus texts, they're fucking wild.
4394380	4398540	And they do things in this completely unnatural geometric way.
4398540	4400940	Because they don't have a rigorous definition of a limit.
4400940	4404900	They don't have a digorous definition of continuity.
4404900	4408460	So they've got to do it with this kind of jiggery-pogory.
4408460	4413220	And Hagle has read all of the relevant books
4413220	4418260	by Lagrange and everybody and is completely fully up to date with it
4418260	4426740	and writes this super long digression about how only his metaphysics of quantity
4426740	4431300	explains properly what the quantitative infinite is.
4431300	4434460	And otherwise, you can't do calculus properly.
4434460	4443260	So if you want this class to take a really weird 90-degree term, OK.
4443260	4443900	That'll be it.
4443900	4445900	I'll see you next week.
4448260	4457580	Can I ask, you can ask all the questions.
4457580	4463420	Why is this called German idealism when it seems like such an extreme realism?
4463420	4471460	So Marcus Gabriel, his joke about this is the English translation of idealism is realism.
4471460	4473580	Now, the reason is, as we see.
