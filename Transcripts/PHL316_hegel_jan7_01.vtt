00:00.000 --> 00:05.320
So let me say a few things about the idea of this class.

00:05.320 --> 00:11.040
So Hegel has always suffered from the problem

00:11.040 --> 00:13.280
that he is very hard to teach.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.640
And the reason he is very hard to teach

00:15.640 --> 00:18.920
is because there is no book by Hegel

00:18.920 --> 00:23.120
that is the equivalent of the critique of pure reason,

00:23.120 --> 00:28.120
or the ethics of Spinoza, or the Republic of Plato,

00:28.240 --> 00:31.800
or Truth is a Human Nature.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.560
That is to say, a single book that you

00:34.560 --> 00:36.920
could teach either in the course of a semester,

00:36.920 --> 00:40.000
or you could teach a significant chunk of a semester,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.120
that gives you, if not the philosopher's whole system,

00:44.120 --> 00:48.960
at least enough of it that you can kind of figure out

00:48.960 --> 00:52.480
how everything fits into it.

00:52.480 --> 00:57.200
The closest thing in Hegel would be the philosophy of right.

00:57.200 --> 01:01.640
But that is really only a very small part of Hegel's system.

01:01.640 --> 01:05.040
The books by Hegel that do contain a more complete

01:05.040 --> 01:07.640
presentation of the system have this problem

01:07.640 --> 01:11.520
that they are unbelievably hard to read,

01:11.520 --> 01:14.240
in particular this one, the Phenomenology of Spirit.

01:14.240 --> 01:17.560
So the standard way that Hegel gets

01:17.560 --> 01:19.760
taught at the undergraduate class

01:19.760 --> 01:22.960
is you teach the Phenomenology of Spirit.

01:22.960 --> 01:26.080
So in the past when I've taught this class,

01:26.080 --> 01:28.200
I have done the standard thing.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.320
You try to read the Phenomenology of Spirit.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.960
The problem with that is that in one semester,

01:32.960 --> 01:36.480
you can only really do half of the Phenomenology.

01:36.480 --> 01:38.640
I never managed to get to the end.

01:38.640 --> 01:42.000
And the Phenomenology of Spirit is, I think,

01:42.000 --> 01:45.960
the hardest book in the entire Western philosophical tradition.

01:45.960 --> 01:49.880
So what has this experience teaching the Phenomenology

01:49.880 --> 01:52.360
of Spirit that, at a certain point, people aren't really

01:52.360 --> 01:53.920
reading the book anymore.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.280
They're just kind of getting a kind of indirect high level

01:57.280 --> 01:58.720
summary of it.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.960
And they're kind of talking about Hegel,

02:00.960 --> 02:03.480
but they're not really talking about what's in the book.

02:03.480 --> 02:04.960
And that's not just true of students

02:04.960 --> 02:06.160
in undergraduate classes.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.520
On Hegel, I sometimes have the impression

02:08.520 --> 02:11.120
with a lot of so-called Hegel scholars

02:11.120 --> 02:13.840
that they're not really reading the same book that I am.

02:13.840 --> 02:17.000
They're kind of like doing this second hand high level

02:17.000 --> 02:17.880
summary of Hegel.

02:17.880 --> 02:22.280
So the last time I taught 316, I went the opposite direction.

02:22.280 --> 02:25.840
We read the Phenomenology of Spirit line by line.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.400
In fact, in at least one three hour course,

02:28.400 --> 02:30.960
we didn't get past a single sentence.

02:30.960 --> 02:35.520
That had the contrary benefit that people were really, really

02:35.520 --> 02:37.800
reading the text.

02:37.800 --> 02:40.160
However, it had the complementary problem

02:40.160 --> 02:42.120
that we didn't get very far.

02:42.120 --> 02:45.520
And after a certain point, even if you're

02:45.520 --> 02:48.280
reading it sentence by sentence, Hegel

02:48.280 --> 02:50.680
is extraordinarily difficult.

02:50.680 --> 02:55.320
So this class is going to go in the opposite direction.

02:55.320 --> 02:59.280
The idea of this class is that we're going to do,

02:59.280 --> 03:04.440
or I'm going to present, the entirety of Hegel's system,

03:04.440 --> 03:05.640
or at least not the whole thing.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.400
You can't do the whole thing one semester.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.680
I'm going to talk about all of the main structural moments

03:10.680 --> 03:11.920
of Hegel's system.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.880
And I'll talk about this in more detail, a little bit more

03:14.880 --> 03:20.040
detail later today, and much more detail in several weeks.

03:20.040 --> 03:22.600
We're going to talk about the Phenomenology of Spirit, which

03:22.600 --> 03:27.280
is the introduction to the system, which has three parts,

03:27.280 --> 03:30.760
logic, philosophy of spirit.

03:34.920 --> 03:38.440
Sorry, I really should bring my notes with me.

03:38.440 --> 03:42.760
Philosophy of nature, that's an embarrassing mistake.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.920
The philosophy of spirit.

03:43.920 --> 03:49.640
So we're obviously not going to read every part.

03:49.640 --> 03:54.040
The book that presents this whole thing is called the Psychopedia.

03:54.040 --> 03:56.800
We're not going to read the entire Encyclopedia.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.240
That would be ridiculous.

03:58.240 --> 04:01.040
But we're going to talk about all of the main structural moments

04:01.040 --> 04:01.920
of this.

04:01.920 --> 04:05.560
So we're going to spend the first two weeks on the Phenomenology

04:05.560 --> 04:06.640
of Spirit.

04:06.640 --> 04:11.680
We're going to spend three, four, five, six, from weeks three

04:11.680 --> 04:13.840
to six on the logic, which means we're

04:13.840 --> 04:16.800
going to talk about the beginning.

04:16.800 --> 04:19.360
And we're going to talk about the end.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.840
And then we're going to spend a week on the transition

04:21.840 --> 04:23.440
to the philosophy of nature.

04:23.440 --> 04:25.400
Then we're going to spend a week talking

04:25.400 --> 04:28.480
about the move from the philosophy of nature

04:28.480 --> 04:30.080
to the philosophy of spirit.

04:30.080 --> 04:36.160
And then we're going to spend one week on the philosophy of right.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.800
It's week nine.

04:37.800 --> 04:41.640
We're going to spend, I feel like I've missed a week somewhere

04:41.640 --> 04:42.140
in here.

04:42.140 --> 04:43.560
This is not quite accurate.

04:43.560 --> 04:45.960
But you get the basic picture.

04:45.960 --> 04:55.400
And then we're going to spend one week on art, one week on religion,

04:55.400 --> 04:59.400
and then one week on philosophy, which

04:59.400 --> 05:02.600
is the return of the philosophy of spirit back to the logic.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.720
So we're not going to cover every single part of the system.

05:05.720 --> 05:09.600
But we are going to talk about all the major moving parts.

05:09.600 --> 05:14.560
So the other idea that sort of mixed in with this idea for this course

05:14.560 --> 05:18.360
is we're going to read all the parts of Hegel you can just read.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.800
We're going to read all the easy parts of it.

05:20.800 --> 05:22.760
And we're going to read them in systematic order

05:22.760 --> 05:26.360
so that you have some idea of what Hegel's philosophical system actually

05:26.360 --> 05:26.960
is.

05:26.960 --> 05:31.120
The other problem with reading the phenomenology of spirit,

05:31.120 --> 05:34.200
the other problem with treating the phenomenology of spirit

05:34.200 --> 05:37.120
as like the textbook for an undergraduate Hegel course,

05:37.120 --> 05:42.240
is I'll talk about this more later today and more next week.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.840
The phenomenology of spirit is in a certain way,

05:44.840 --> 05:49.400
although this requires qualifications, only Hegel's negative view.

05:49.400 --> 05:53.000
It should bear the subtitle wrong answers only.

05:53.000 --> 05:57.240
So the phenomenology of spirit is a series of failed attempts,

05:57.240 --> 05:59.880
failed accounts of what knowledge is.

05:59.880 --> 06:04.600
So it's just very weird that this book has become treated

06:04.600 --> 06:07.440
as the critique of pure reason of Hegel.

06:07.440 --> 06:11.200
That is just, I mean, Hegel would be totally shocked

06:11.200 --> 06:13.160
that this is the book that everyone reads,

06:13.160 --> 06:16.720
because it's basically his jubinellia.

06:16.720 --> 06:19.320
And he wasn't even really sure what to do with it

06:19.320 --> 06:22.160
once he had completed the mature system, which is this.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.400
OK.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.960
So that's the idea of what you've gotten yourself into.

06:31.960 --> 06:32.920
OK.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.360
Some course mechanics.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.240
The syllabus is on Quercus.

06:37.240 --> 06:38.800
I will just say a few things about it.

06:38.800 --> 06:40.800
I find discussing course mechanics in the beginning

06:40.800 --> 06:42.720
of the semester really boring.

06:42.720 --> 06:44.280
So I'm going to do this very quickly.

06:44.280 --> 06:47.520
You have to write two essays, and there is a final exam

06:47.520 --> 06:49.480
during the exam period.

06:49.480 --> 06:53.080
The, you know, it couldn't be more straightforward.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.280
OK.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.920
Your participation grade will be determined

06:56.920 --> 07:00.160
on the basis of how many weeks you submit questions

07:00.160 --> 07:01.400
about the reading.

07:01.400 --> 07:03.160
So the questions about the reading should be written.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.160
You can type them if you want, but it's also

07:05.160 --> 07:06.720
fine to submit them just handwritten,

07:06.720 --> 07:09.160
as long as your handwriting is legible.

07:09.160 --> 07:11.680
And they should be questions about the reading for that week.

07:11.680 --> 07:15.400
And not, you know, like, I was an undergraduate too once.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.000
I know all the tricks, right?

07:17.000 --> 07:19.640
So not like you just turn to a random page in the reading,

07:19.640 --> 07:22.400
and you find Hegel saying, the study of philosophy

07:22.400 --> 07:25.120
is hindered by the conduct of only clever argumentation.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.160
Why does Hegel say the, you know,

07:27.160 --> 07:29.360
that's not what I'm looking for.

07:29.440 --> 07:31.520
You know, put, like, say a little bit more

07:31.520 --> 07:35.280
about why this question is relevant or contextualize it.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.440
Given that Hegel says this, and he says this other thing,

07:37.440 --> 07:38.520
how is this compatible?

07:38.520 --> 07:41.400
Why does Hegel think that this transition is unproblematic?

07:41.400 --> 07:43.160
Why is this argument supposed to be good?

07:43.160 --> 07:44.160
How is this consistent?

07:44.160 --> 07:44.960
Something like that.

07:44.960 --> 07:45.920
Two for every week.

07:45.920 --> 07:46.480
OK.

07:46.480 --> 07:49.040
So some of you probably, how many of you

07:49.040 --> 07:51.120
brought reading questions for this week?

07:51.120 --> 07:52.120
OK, good.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.360
That's great.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.120
A lot of you joined the class later,

07:55.120 --> 07:56.640
didn't know about this, so I'm going

07:56.640 --> 07:58.200
to treat those as extra credit.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.120
You can hand them, you can give them to me

08:00.120 --> 08:01.440
at the end of the day.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.800
But in general, they're due first thing.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.840
So you know, this is like, don't show up

08:05.840 --> 08:08.240
and think you can scribble a few questions about the reading

08:08.240 --> 08:09.560
and grab total credit for it.

08:09.560 --> 08:10.920
That's not going to work.

08:10.920 --> 08:11.800
OK.

08:11.800 --> 08:17.560
Other than that, how many of you here are auditing this class?

08:17.560 --> 08:18.440
OK.

08:18.440 --> 08:19.840
That's a lot.

08:19.840 --> 08:21.200
That's like an insane number.

08:21.200 --> 08:21.720
OK.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.160
So let me just say, those of you who

08:24.160 --> 08:26.720
are taking this class for credit,

08:26.720 --> 08:30.720
you have something of great value that other people want,

08:30.720 --> 08:32.760
which means you have to earn it.

08:32.760 --> 08:35.760
So do your best work.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.480
Because if you don't do your best work,

08:38.480 --> 08:41.400
I would prefer that you just drop the class

08:41.400 --> 08:43.760
and one of the people who's auditing it take your spot.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.280
Because many of them are very, very motivated.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.560
OK.

08:48.560 --> 08:53.480
Let me say one or two things more.

08:53.480 --> 08:56.000
Why is Hegel relevant, or why is Hegel important?

08:56.000 --> 08:59.480
Why should you spend the amount of energy

08:59.480 --> 09:03.720
that you're going to have to expend this semester on Hegel?

09:03.720 --> 09:05.960
I mean, the other reason that I've designed this class

09:05.960 --> 09:08.360
is I wanted to finally teach a Hegel class that

09:08.360 --> 09:11.320
wasn't impossibly difficult.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.840
This is supposed to be like moderate level difficulty

09:13.840 --> 09:14.600
Hegel.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.120
OK.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.520
I mean, for the most part, not a sign of a really impossible

09:19.520 --> 09:20.960
hard things in Hegel.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.440
But there's a few weeks where we are

09:24.440 --> 09:26.960
going to read some really hard stuff in Hegel,

09:26.960 --> 09:29.880
and I will kind of hold your hand through those.

09:29.880 --> 09:30.560
OK.

09:30.560 --> 09:35.640
So I regard Hegel as the philosophical equal,

09:35.640 --> 09:38.680
the peer of Plato and Aristotle.

09:38.680 --> 09:42.520
I think he's the only modern philosopher other than Kant,

09:42.520 --> 09:45.120
who has that kind of status.

09:45.120 --> 09:48.320
In a more generous mood, or if Tariq Dicco were here,

09:48.320 --> 09:51.040
I would include Heidegger.

09:51.080 --> 09:54.440
But, and Hegel has had an enormous influence

09:54.440 --> 09:58.320
on European philosophy, the Western philosophy,

09:58.320 --> 09:59.800
after that.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.800
But always, I think, in a distorted form.

10:02.800 --> 10:06.160
That is to say, the Hegel that was taken up

10:06.160 --> 10:10.560
and was influential in philosophy after that

10:10.560 --> 10:15.440
was always in one way or another distorted version of Hegel.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.520
So that, in a certain way, the true Hegel

10:18.520 --> 10:21.320
remains to be understood and really

10:21.320 --> 10:24.160
philosophically appreciated.

10:24.160 --> 10:27.320
Which also makes reading Hegel very exciting,

10:27.320 --> 10:31.360
because there's more work to be done in understanding Hegel,

10:31.360 --> 10:33.400
not just exegetically, but philosophically,

10:33.400 --> 10:35.600
than there is with any other comparably

10:35.600 --> 10:40.400
important modern philosophy, even Kant, especially Kant.

10:40.400 --> 10:44.880
Kant is, in a certain way, relatively well understood,

10:44.880 --> 10:46.960
vastly better understood than Hegel.

10:46.960 --> 10:50.280
And Hegel has only himself to blame for this.

10:50.280 --> 10:54.600
The books are, aside from the philosophy of right,

10:54.600 --> 11:00.120
extraordinarily kind of maddeningly difficult.

11:00.120 --> 11:02.920
Sometimes read as though they are.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.800
So Hegel has a reputation, especially

11:05.800 --> 11:09.400
in the English language tradition,

11:09.400 --> 11:13.800
of just being an author of Gable de Gug of gibberish.

11:13.800 --> 11:14.720
That's not true.

11:14.720 --> 11:18.200
That reflects more on the readers who say that,

11:18.200 --> 11:20.000
or that he's some kind of mystic.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.840
Also, that's just a simple misreading.

11:21.840 --> 11:27.480
But the books are forbiddingly difficult and dense.

11:27.480 --> 11:29.440
There are significant chunks.

11:29.440 --> 11:33.040
I mean, I've spent so much time reading these books.

11:33.040 --> 11:36.200
I'm on my second read.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.480
I read the Phonology of Spirit cover to cover

11:38.480 --> 11:40.440
with some friends, and then I immediately

11:40.440 --> 11:41.880
started rereading it from scratch.

11:41.880 --> 11:45.800
And that's my fourth complete read through in my life.

11:45.800 --> 11:48.680
And I'm constantly rereading the Science of Logic.

11:48.680 --> 11:51.640
There are chunks of these books that I just

11:51.640 --> 11:53.840
have to throw my hands around.

11:53.840 --> 11:57.520
I don't really know what's going on.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.880
Now, there's a reason, and we'll see this

11:59.880 --> 12:01.480
over the course of the semester.

12:01.480 --> 12:04.960
It's not just that Hegel was a bad writer, which he wasn't.

12:04.960 --> 12:08.000
So Hegel has this reputation for being a bad writer.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.720
This is simply false.

12:09.720 --> 12:14.120
When Hegel wants to, he can be eloquent, indeed beautiful.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.040
There's actually a philosophical reason

12:16.040 --> 12:20.680
for why the books are written as densely as they are.

12:20.680 --> 12:24.200
I also think part of the reason why some parts of the books

12:24.200 --> 12:27.160
are as dense as they are is because Hegel had not fully

12:27.160 --> 12:29.960
worked out his theory.

12:29.960 --> 12:33.200
He had not fully worked out his system in all of the detail

12:33.200 --> 12:38.160
that he presents it as having been worked out in.

12:38.160 --> 12:42.040
Failures of presentation are often failures of thought.

12:42.040 --> 12:44.320
And I think to some extent, that's

12:44.320 --> 12:46.760
part of what's going on with Hegel in some places.

12:46.760 --> 12:48.920
And also, I think there are philosophical reasons

12:48.920 --> 12:51.880
for why the books have to be written in this way that

12:51.880 --> 12:55.240
is extremely difficult to read.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.920
But because Hegel has, in my view,

12:58.920 --> 13:02.840
never been received as Hegel, that is to say,

13:02.840 --> 13:05.040
the reception of Hegel has always been the distortion

13:05.040 --> 13:05.760
of Hegel.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.480
That makes Hegel exciting.

13:08.480 --> 13:15.000
In a certain way, in other moods,

13:15.000 --> 13:17.640
I would say this more vociferously.

13:17.640 --> 13:21.680
In a certain way, the big, unaccomplished task

13:21.680 --> 13:24.720
of philosophy in Western tradition

13:24.720 --> 13:27.360
is fully understanding and grappling with Hegel.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.960
I think that's the thing that hasn't really been done.

13:29.960 --> 13:33.480
And this class can serve as a kind of introduction

13:33.480 --> 13:36.360
to doing that, and maybe an inspiration to you

13:36.360 --> 13:37.560
to do that further.

13:37.560 --> 13:41.240
Because one of the ways that I hope this class will function

13:41.240 --> 13:47.720
is as a propagutic for you to read more of Hegel

13:47.720 --> 13:52.040
on your own, an entry point in Hegel

13:52.040 --> 13:54.120
so that you can study it more on your own.

13:54.120 --> 13:57.400
OK, there is no textbook for this class.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.760
All of the readings are going to be online

13:59.760 --> 14:03.200
on corkis in the form of PDFs, which

14:03.200 --> 14:08.640
means that if you want to, you can read them on screens.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.200
And that means that I will have to allow laptops

14:11.200 --> 14:14.560
in this class if normally I don't, which I hate doing.

14:14.560 --> 14:19.560
The reason I hate doing that is because these things are just

14:19.560 --> 14:20.920
distraction machines.

14:20.920 --> 14:23.400
So whenever you see a screen, what you should see

14:23.400 --> 14:27.760
is a conspiracy by very rich and powerful people

14:27.760 --> 14:30.360
to destroy your mind and ruin your life,

14:30.360 --> 14:33.080
because that's, in fact, what they are.

14:33.080 --> 14:37.520
They are the great toxin of our contemporary world.

14:37.520 --> 14:40.280
And so I would prefer to not have them in the classroom.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.680
Somehow, all of the best philosophy ever written

14:42.680 --> 14:45.560
was written without them, so we don't actually

14:45.560 --> 14:47.240
need them for any of this.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.400
In fact, all of the best philosophy

14:49.400 --> 14:54.200
was done and taught without artificial light.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.960
So I would really like to someday teach a class.

14:57.600 --> 15:00.080
If you go to old German universities,

15:00.080 --> 15:02.720
if you go to what is now Pumboldo Investitatie

15:02.720 --> 15:04.120
in Berlin, the University of Berlin,

15:04.120 --> 15:07.080
where Hegel is a professor, the Bruins

15:07.080 --> 15:11.040
have these gigantic floor-to-ceiling windows,

15:11.040 --> 15:14.280
because of course, there was no artificial light.

15:14.280 --> 15:18.560
And teaching by candlelight is not really a safe or

15:18.560 --> 15:19.960
particularly practical.

15:19.960 --> 15:23.440
So in fact, we don't even need this horrible fluorescent

15:23.440 --> 15:26.240
or a headlighting that's ugly and destroys,

15:26.240 --> 15:29.080
diminishes the human spirit.

15:29.080 --> 15:33.800
But unfortunately, we are stuck with this institutional setup.

15:33.800 --> 15:37.200
So that was all a way of saying, I encourage you

15:37.200 --> 15:44.800
to print out the reading and read Hegel in print,

15:44.800 --> 15:49.480
because all of the evidence is that you understand

15:49.480 --> 15:53.640
and remember things better when you read them in print.

15:56.240 --> 15:57.920
When you read something on paper,

15:57.920 --> 16:01.040
you have this multimodal sensory experience of it.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.480
It's both tactile.

16:02.480 --> 16:07.000
If it's a pretty old book, it has an olfactory dimension.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.240
You shouldn't taste the books.

16:08.240 --> 16:10.080
You have a gustatory dimension.

16:10.080 --> 16:13.040
But there's all the physical, it's carrying it around.

16:13.040 --> 16:15.960
You develop a physical relationship with your book.

16:15.960 --> 16:18.600
So if you've ever taken a class under critique of pure reason,

16:18.600 --> 16:23.040
by the end of the semester, your critique is like this.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.440
Binding has been destroyed.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.920
It's covered in notations.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.920
And it's like a physically important object to you.

16:28.920 --> 16:31.240
And that physical defecation to the book, I think,

16:31.240 --> 16:35.040
actually improves your learning and reading experience.

16:35.040 --> 16:38.480
Even better would be if you wanted to buy or somehow

16:38.480 --> 16:41.640
acquire the physical books.

16:41.640 --> 16:43.960
But I'm not going to require that because, of course,

16:43.960 --> 16:45.800
we're only going to read a little bit of this

16:45.800 --> 16:48.240
and then a little bit of the science of logic.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.720
If I made you buy the books for all this class,

16:50.720 --> 16:53.720
it would be more expensive than I can reasonably expect from you.

16:53.720 --> 16:54.600
OK.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.200
So that is everything that I'm going

16:56.200 --> 16:59.600
to say about course mechanics before we

16:59.600 --> 17:06.880
dive into the phenomenology of spirit itself.

17:06.880 --> 17:18.200
Let me just say, normally, so GWF Hegel, born in 1770,

17:19.160 --> 17:22.600
you need 31, normally the principle

17:22.600 --> 17:25.880
in which I operate with respect to historical philosophers

17:25.880 --> 17:28.680
is all that we need to say about them is they were born,

17:28.680 --> 17:30.880
they worked, and they died.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.440
Now, I'm going to slightly violate my own rule

17:34.440 --> 17:37.360
because I'm a big fan of the digression.

17:37.360 --> 17:41.480
And in being a fan of the digression in the lecture,

17:41.480 --> 17:45.560
I have no less eminent of precursor than Hegel himself

17:45.560 --> 17:48.440
because in the transcripts of Hegel's lectures, some

17:48.440 --> 17:50.280
of which we will read, Hegel's constantly

17:50.280 --> 17:51.920
going on these digressions, some of which

17:51.920 --> 17:55.840
are totally off topic and some of which are hilarious.

17:55.840 --> 17:59.800
He'll talk about some recent play that's been displayed.

17:59.800 --> 18:04.320
So a little bit of digression is fun,

18:04.320 --> 18:09.760
distracts us from what Hegel calls the rigor of the concept.

18:09.760 --> 18:12.880
But occasionally, biographical remarks about Hegel

18:12.880 --> 18:15.000
will actually be exegetically relevant.

18:15.080 --> 18:18.320
And so I'll say a few things about Hegel's life.

18:18.320 --> 18:18.820
OK.

18:21.760 --> 18:24.640
This was all that I want to say initially

18:24.640 --> 18:25.960
about Hegel's philosophy.

18:25.960 --> 18:29.160
I don't like beginning a class by giving

18:29.160 --> 18:31.880
this big aerial overview of the philosopher

18:31.880 --> 18:35.560
or the philosophical work precisely because it's

18:35.560 --> 18:37.040
given purely externally.

18:37.040 --> 18:38.800
It's just narration.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.720
It's something you could learn from the Stanford

18:40.720 --> 18:45.520
Encyclopedia of Philosophy or YouTube.

18:45.520 --> 18:46.600
It's not philosophy.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.480
It wouldn't be philosophically justified.

18:48.480 --> 18:50.240
It wouldn't be doing any philosophy for you.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.800
We wouldn't be doing any philosophy together.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.320
I'd just be telling you some stuff.

18:53.320 --> 19:00.960
So as we'll see, because Hegel takes very seriously

19:00.960 --> 19:04.600
the ambition that philosophy should develop everything

19:04.600 --> 19:09.000
from itself, it's particularly inappropriate to Hegel

19:09.000 --> 19:12.640
to begin with this external just telling you something,

19:12.640 --> 19:14.840
mere reports.

19:14.840 --> 19:18.720
I would prefer to begin talking about Hegel

19:18.720 --> 19:21.280
by doing philosophy in the Hegelian way, which

19:21.280 --> 19:23.760
is developing it internally just through thinking something

19:23.760 --> 19:24.360
through.

19:24.360 --> 19:26.640
So that's all that I want to say initially

19:26.640 --> 19:28.360
about Hegel's philosophy.

19:28.360 --> 19:30.480
I'll just say one or two things more

19:30.480 --> 19:33.640
about what's special about Hegel.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.960
Hegel is probably the most ambitious philosopher

19:37.960 --> 19:39.360
who's ever existed.

19:39.360 --> 19:42.800
So the ambition of Hegel's philosophy

19:42.800 --> 19:46.520
is to develop all of this, which is

19:46.520 --> 19:49.380
to say a completely systematic epistemology,

19:49.380 --> 19:50.960
a completely systematic metaphysics,

19:50.960 --> 19:53.400
a completely systematic account of the natural world,

19:53.400 --> 19:56.760
a completely systematic account of the mind, which

19:56.760 --> 19:58.640
includes a completely systematic account

19:58.640 --> 20:00.920
of moral and political philosophy,

20:00.920 --> 20:03.760
a completely systematic account of art and its history,

20:03.760 --> 20:06.400
a completely systematic account of the history of religion,

20:06.400 --> 20:11.880
And true religion, Hegel calls consonant religion,

20:11.880 --> 20:15.760
without any presuppositions.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.000
That's the most ambitious that I think philosophy has ever

20:18.000 --> 20:18.500
gotten.

20:18.500 --> 20:21.360
So Hegel is, in a certain way, the person

20:21.360 --> 20:25.760
who has the most faith or confidence in philosophy

20:25.760 --> 20:27.600
that I can think of.

20:27.600 --> 20:31.280
Everyone since Hegel has been more disillusioned

20:31.280 --> 20:32.240
about philosophy.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.280
Or another way of pointing that point

20:34.280 --> 20:37.920
is Hegel is even more than Kant.

20:37.920 --> 20:40.720
The person, the philosopher, with the most confidence

20:40.720 --> 20:46.520
that reason, just reasoning, can do everything that we want.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.680
That it can be completely satisfactory.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.480
Reason can be completely self-determinate.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.480
Doesn't need anything outside.

20:53.480 --> 20:55.440
Everyone in philosophy, since Hegel,

20:55.440 --> 20:58.320
has been more pessimistic about the possibility

20:58.320 --> 21:00.280
of this complete self-determination

21:00.280 --> 21:01.880
of rational thought.

21:02.880 --> 21:05.360
Questions about that before we dive

21:05.360 --> 21:07.080
into the phenomenology of spirit itself?

21:12.040 --> 21:12.540
No?

21:12.540 --> 21:13.040
Yeah.

21:13.040 --> 21:13.540
Hey.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.120
I'm not sure what that's supposed to be,

21:15.120 --> 21:16.960
but can I ask something about the question?

21:16.960 --> 21:17.960
Sure.

21:17.960 --> 21:19.000
The question is this.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.040
On the set of us, that's like two, three lines.

21:21.040 --> 21:23.800
But you ask us to contextualize it.

21:23.800 --> 21:27.080
That would require us to pull up Hegel.

21:27.080 --> 21:29.800
But that makes it less space, like one line or two.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.800
So by two or three sentence, do you

21:31.800 --> 21:35.800
make two or three sentence of a whole world together?

21:35.800 --> 21:42.080
You're taking, like, we'll figure it out.

21:42.080 --> 21:47.000
Yeah, you're taking a rule of thumb too precisely.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.200
Oh, the other thing I want to say

21:48.200 --> 21:52.380
is if anyone reads German, I would

21:52.380 --> 21:57.800
encourage you to try to read at least some of this in German.

21:57.800 --> 22:01.080
The translations vary a great deal in quality.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.800
And so one of the themes of this semester

22:03.800 --> 22:05.960
that you will probably learn to find really annoying

22:05.960 --> 22:11.080
will be complaining about various Hegel translations.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.880
I haven't been hard about whether to use this

22:12.880 --> 22:14.680
as the textbook for the course.

22:14.680 --> 22:17.560
This is the closest thing to a collection

22:17.560 --> 22:19.560
of all of the relevant texts that we

22:19.560 --> 22:21.000
would read in this class.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.880
The reason I decided against it is the translations

22:23.880 --> 22:26.500
are, in some cases, very strange.

22:26.500 --> 22:30.740
And the selections are, in some cases, I think not ideal.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.780
And so then I thought, OK, then they're

22:32.780 --> 22:34.860
going to have to listen to me complain, not only

22:34.860 --> 22:38.060
about the translations, but also Holgate selections.

22:38.060 --> 22:39.820
That will open order the hell out of them.

22:39.820 --> 22:42.260
So I'll just make my own selections.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.300
Yes?

22:44.300 --> 22:46.020
I don't know if it's too early, but I

22:46.020 --> 22:51.940
want to know how Hegel connects logic to aesthetics and how.

22:51.940 --> 22:54.260
Oh, that's way too early.

22:54.260 --> 22:54.940
Way too early.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.100
We're not even.

22:56.180 --> 22:58.180
We don't even know what logic is yet.

22:58.180 --> 23:01.220
That's just a word on a blackboard.

23:01.220 --> 23:03.740
So using the Cambridge translations.

23:03.740 --> 23:06.940
Using the Cambridge translations insofar as it's possible.

23:06.940 --> 23:09.500
So the Cambridge translations, the Cambridge Hegel

23:09.500 --> 23:11.080
translations, you might think, oh, my god,

23:11.080 --> 23:12.380
they're going to translate everything.

23:12.380 --> 23:14.380
But they have now translated the phenomenology

23:14.380 --> 23:17.580
of spirit, the science of logic, the encyclopedia logic,

23:17.580 --> 23:21.900
the Hegel's writings from Heidelberg, and that's it.

23:21.900 --> 23:24.100
And so you might think, oh, everything's coming out more.

23:24.100 --> 23:27.540
No, Hilary Gaskin, the main philosophy

23:27.540 --> 23:28.980
editor at Cambridge University Press,

23:28.980 --> 23:30.780
has announced it's complete.

23:30.780 --> 23:32.780
That's all they're going to do.

23:32.780 --> 23:34.500
And that's all they ever intended to.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.820
That is not, in fact, a complete story.

23:36.820 --> 23:40.100
In fact, so I'll tell you, at some point

23:40.100 --> 23:42.620
when I feel like we need a break,

23:42.620 --> 23:44.820
I'll give you the complete backstory about how

23:44.820 --> 23:48.260
the Cambridge Hegel translation is so radically incomplete.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.300
And it was, of course, never intended to be in complete

23:50.300 --> 23:51.100
this way.

23:51.100 --> 23:53.660
The short answer is they decided to woefully

23:53.740 --> 23:57.340
underpay the editorial order, who all resigned.

23:57.340 --> 24:01.020
And then at some point, the new editorial board,

24:01.020 --> 24:02.380
some point Cambridge just realized

24:02.380 --> 24:04.020
it wasn't worth the money.

24:04.020 --> 24:06.660
So we're now in this totally ridiculous situation

24:06.660 --> 24:10.460
that there is never going to be, in the foreseeable future,

24:10.460 --> 24:13.440
a good, complete translation of the works

24:13.440 --> 24:15.500
of Hegel in England.

24:15.500 --> 24:18.900
So now, OK, I'll say one other thing.

24:18.900 --> 24:21.380
There are two different, there's basically

24:21.380 --> 24:25.380
two different editions of the works of Hegel in German.

24:25.380 --> 24:29.780
The first one is published by a, is now

24:29.780 --> 24:36.660
published by a press in Germany called Zuk.

24:36.660 --> 24:38.340
Those are, if you ever see, they're

24:38.340 --> 24:41.300
sort of very dark blue paperbacks.

24:41.300 --> 24:46.020
That translation goes back to a translation that was made,

24:46.020 --> 24:48.620
sorry, an edition that was made immediately

24:48.620 --> 24:52.460
after Hegel's death by this group called themselves

24:52.460 --> 24:54.140
the Friends of Hegel.

24:54.140 --> 24:56.580
Now, the problem with that edition

24:56.580 --> 24:58.900
is that it isn't up to contemporary

24:58.900 --> 25:00.900
filmological snuff.

25:00.900 --> 25:04.620
In particular, with respect to Hegel's lectures,

25:04.620 --> 25:06.860
they did this thing that from a contemporary point of view

25:06.860 --> 25:08.780
was totally outrageous.

25:08.780 --> 25:12.060
People, the people who were editing Hegel's lectures,

25:12.060 --> 25:15.940
took all of Hegel's notes and the student transcripts

25:15.940 --> 25:20.660
and then composed one sort of condensed version

25:20.660 --> 25:23.780
of all of this information and then destroyed,

25:23.780 --> 25:27.900
in many cases, the originals so that we can't verify

25:27.900 --> 25:30.460
whether their edition was correct.

25:30.460 --> 25:35.580
So this was for, this was until the 70s, the only edition

25:35.580 --> 25:38.500
of Hegel that there was.

25:38.500 --> 25:45.020
Now, after that, there's the Academy edition,

25:45.020 --> 25:47.300
where people actually sat down and did

25:47.300 --> 25:49.220
the really philologically respectable thing.

25:49.220 --> 25:53.100
I mean, the other thing is, for instance, the Friends of Hegel

25:53.100 --> 25:56.260
edition only contains one edition of the Encyclopedia.

25:56.260 --> 25:59.340
It only contains one edition of the Science of Logic.

25:59.340 --> 26:00.980
That, by contemporary philological standards,

26:00.980 --> 26:03.740
is radically inadequate.

26:03.740 --> 26:07.900
The Academy edition does this much more complete job.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.700
But the weird result of that is almost all

26:10.700 --> 26:13.300
of the translations of Hegel into English that

26:13.420 --> 26:16.060
existed historically are based on this.

26:16.060 --> 26:17.460
And so you would think, well, this

26:17.460 --> 26:19.260
would be a perfect opportunity for Cambridge

26:19.260 --> 26:21.300
to do the English translations from that.

26:21.300 --> 26:23.500
But that's not going to happen because they

26:23.500 --> 26:25.300
underpaid the editorial board.

26:25.300 --> 26:27.140
Also, these editorial board guys,

26:27.140 --> 26:28.620
like they're all tenure professors

26:28.620 --> 26:29.940
drawing massive salaries.

26:29.940 --> 26:31.500
They could just do it for free.

26:31.500 --> 26:34.900
But I wouldn't tell that to their face.

26:34.900 --> 26:37.740
So the other thing that's weird is,

26:37.740 --> 26:40.300
so there are all these people make a big deal about this.

26:40.300 --> 26:42.260
They just think, oh, you can never

26:42.260 --> 26:45.340
talk about Hegel's lectures from the old Friends of Hegel

26:45.340 --> 26:45.860
edition.

26:45.860 --> 26:47.900
You have to only cite the Academy edition.

26:47.900 --> 26:51.540
But the problem is, almost all of the reception of Hegel

26:51.540 --> 26:53.060
through the history of philosophy

26:53.060 --> 26:55.700
from his death in 1831 until whenever this was published

26:55.700 --> 26:59.100
in the 60s or 70s was based on the old edition.

26:59.100 --> 27:03.140
So these poorly edited editions of Hegel's lectures

27:03.140 --> 27:04.900
are the things that are really influential.

27:04.900 --> 27:08.260
So when people talk about Hegel's philosophy of history,

27:08.260 --> 27:09.980
almost everyone who's ever engaged

27:09.980 --> 27:11.140
with Hegel's philosophy of history

27:11.140 --> 27:13.300
was engaging with the poorly edited edition,

27:13.300 --> 27:14.700
including Marx and everyone else.

27:14.700 --> 27:21.420
So I think you can't just ignore this one.

27:21.420 --> 27:25.660
In many cases, the older edition, the not so good edition,

27:25.660 --> 27:28.460
makes the text much more readable and fluent.

27:28.460 --> 27:31.220
And so when we come to read some of Hegel's lectures,

27:31.220 --> 27:33.220
for instance, his lectures on the philosophy of art,

27:33.220 --> 27:37.620
the philosophy of religion, and the history of philosophy,

27:37.620 --> 27:39.540
I will assign some of the translations

27:39.540 --> 27:40.940
from the older editions because they're

27:41.020 --> 27:41.900
just more readable.

27:41.900 --> 27:43.980
And they are the things that everyone's been talking about.

27:43.980 --> 27:46.100
Ever since, so if you hear someone talking about Hegel

27:46.100 --> 27:47.860
and some other book, they're almost certainly

27:47.860 --> 27:48.660
talking about this.

27:48.660 --> 27:50.300
So what value would it be to you?

27:50.300 --> 27:53.620
You're like, oh, well, actually, the Hotho transcript.

27:53.620 --> 27:54.340
You don't care.

27:54.340 --> 27:57.260
I barely care.

27:57.260 --> 27:57.980
OK.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.900
Other questions before we start talking

27:59.900 --> 28:02.580
about the phenomenology of spirit?

28:02.580 --> 28:03.060
Yes.

28:03.060 --> 28:04.580
I've heard that three years ago,

28:04.580 --> 28:06.900
you called it a people person.

28:06.900 --> 28:10.980
That only went through 40 or 50 pages of the phenomenology.

28:10.980 --> 28:11.460
Yeah.

28:11.460 --> 28:14.140
What would be the content-wise difference

28:14.140 --> 28:16.660
between these two persons in terms of yours?

28:16.660 --> 28:21.140
More of you will understand what I'm saying in this course.

28:21.140 --> 28:25.340
Or no, the problem with that course is, so I got through

28:25.340 --> 28:27.540
about, did Siwan tell you that?

28:27.540 --> 28:28.020
Yeah.

28:28.020 --> 28:29.900
OK.

28:29.900 --> 28:33.180
Siwan likes that word.

28:33.180 --> 28:33.780
So let's see.

28:33.780 --> 28:36.460
If I did 50 pages in that class, I got more than that.

28:36.460 --> 28:41.060
I got all the way up to maybe sort of skepticism.

28:41.060 --> 28:43.300
But I kind of rushed through some of skepticism.

28:43.300 --> 28:46.420
So we did maybe like 70 pages.

28:46.420 --> 28:47.980
And the problem with that is you just

28:47.980 --> 28:50.340
learn in a lot of detail the early moves

28:50.340 --> 28:53.180
of the phenomenology of spirit, which doesn't tell you.

28:53.180 --> 28:58.340
That basically taught people 10% of this.

28:58.340 --> 29:05.380
This is 10% of this weird, immature, semi-juvenalia

29:05.380 --> 29:06.660
introduction to Hegel system.

29:06.660 --> 29:07.860
It's not Hegel system.

29:07.860 --> 29:08.380
OK.

29:08.380 --> 29:10.820
But to say more about why just teaching

29:10.820 --> 29:15.140
the phenomenology of spirit would be so inadequate,

29:15.140 --> 29:17.180
I mean, certainly this version of 360

29:17.180 --> 29:21.380
is an elaborate apology for the last time I taught 360.

29:21.380 --> 29:23.220
Let's just dive into the text.

29:23.220 --> 29:26.340
So if you do not have a copy of the text,

29:26.340 --> 29:29.060
rearrange yourself so that you are sitting next to someone

29:29.060 --> 29:31.900
who does have a copy of the text.

29:31.900 --> 29:34.700
So I'll give you a few minutes to do that.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.620
So if two of you are sitting next to each other

29:36.620 --> 29:44.380
and you have copies of the text, yeah, sorry, what?

29:44.380 --> 29:47.420
Yeah, I mean, there'll be some differences.

29:47.420 --> 29:49.300
But you'll basically know what's going on.

29:56.300 --> 29:59.580
Is anyone in a Hegel island isolated

29:59.580 --> 30:03.740
from any other copy of the text?

30:03.740 --> 30:05.860
I would have brought additional copies of the text

30:05.860 --> 30:07.060
if I had thought of that.

30:07.060 --> 30:09.340
Yeah, no screen.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.900
OK.

30:11.900 --> 30:16.500
It is a natural supposition that in philosophy,

30:16.500 --> 30:20.740
before one gets down to dealing with what is that issue,

30:20.740 --> 30:25.060
namely the actual cognition of what in truth is.

30:25.060 --> 30:28.620
So the issue of philosophy is actually

30:28.620 --> 30:31.180
cognizing what in truth is.

30:31.180 --> 30:36.860
Now, there's two words here in German, erkenen and bissen.

30:39.740 --> 30:43.900
Pinker has, in almost all cases, translated erkenen

30:43.900 --> 30:50.980
has to cognize, and bissen has to know.

30:50.980 --> 30:55.820
But he's, now there is a difference between erkenen

30:55.820 --> 30:58.100
and bissen in Hegel.

30:58.100 --> 31:02.020
But erkenen and bissen are both totally ordinary words

31:02.020 --> 31:04.460
in German for knowledge.

31:04.460 --> 31:08.820
So epistemology in German is referred to as erketnesteri,

31:08.820 --> 31:10.380
the theory of erketens.

31:10.380 --> 31:13.060
That's the noun for erketens.

31:13.060 --> 31:17.020
So it would be totally fine to translate both of them

31:17.020 --> 31:18.460
as knowledge.

31:18.460 --> 31:21.500
But Pinker has decided to just mark in English

31:21.500 --> 31:23.100
a distinction in the German.

31:23.100 --> 31:27.180
So it would be totally fine if we read this as saying,

31:27.180 --> 31:29.500
before one gets down to dealing with what is at issue,

31:29.500 --> 31:33.780
namely the actual knowledge, actually knowing what is true.

31:33.780 --> 31:35.580
So now, Hegel uses the difference

31:35.580 --> 31:39.300
between bissen and erkenen to mark some kind of difference.

31:39.300 --> 31:41.700
But it isn't super crucial right now.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.460
So we can also just read cognition here as knowledge.

31:44.460 --> 31:47.020
It is a natural supposition that in philosophy,

31:47.020 --> 31:50.020
before one gets down to dealing with what is at issue,

31:50.020 --> 31:53.060
namely the actual knowledge of what in truth is.

31:53.060 --> 31:54.980
So the business of philosophy is actually

31:54.980 --> 31:57.340
knowing what in truth is.

31:57.340 --> 32:01.260
So not potentially knowing or kind of knowing or having faith,

32:01.260 --> 32:06.820
but knowing and knowing what is true, what is actually true.

32:06.820 --> 32:09.860
It is first necessary to come to an understanding

32:09.860 --> 32:12.460
about knowledge, which is regarded

32:12.460 --> 32:16.620
as the instrument by which one seizes hold of the absolute

32:16.620 --> 32:20.540
or as the means by which one catches sight of it.

32:20.540 --> 32:22.660
So the first word you should stumble over here

32:22.660 --> 32:24.220
is the absolute.

32:24.300 --> 32:28.180
So the absolute is this major topic

32:28.180 --> 32:34.420
and preoccupation of German philosophy from Kant to Hegel.

32:34.420 --> 32:36.940
So in the context in which Hegel is writing this,

32:36.940 --> 32:40.380
roughly Jena in 1807, the absolute

32:40.380 --> 32:42.860
is the thing everyone cares about.

32:42.860 --> 32:46.060
But I want to put the absolute aside for a moment,

32:46.060 --> 32:50.180
because this is kind of provisional.

32:50.180 --> 32:52.180
Over the course of today, you'll understand better

32:52.180 --> 32:53.620
what I mean by this.

32:54.500 --> 32:57.180
Hegel won't, in the introduction to the phenomenology,

32:57.180 --> 33:00.100
yet have an argument that the topic of philosophy

33:00.100 --> 33:03.100
should be the absolute, or that what the topic of knowledge

33:03.100 --> 33:04.540
is is the absolute.

33:04.540 --> 33:08.020
He, over the course of the phenomenology and the logic,

33:08.020 --> 33:09.180
will develop that.

33:09.180 --> 33:12.780
So this is a foreshadowing of something

33:12.780 --> 33:14.580
that you usually have to argue for,

33:14.580 --> 33:17.180
although his audience in 1807 would assume, of course,

33:17.180 --> 33:20.020
what we really wanted to have knowledge of is the absolute.

33:20.020 --> 33:21.820
So what the absolute is, I'm going

33:21.820 --> 33:24.860
to set aside until we see Hegel's view of the absolute.

33:24.860 --> 33:27.860
But if you need a sort of precursor,

33:27.860 --> 33:30.500
you can think of it as God a little bit better.

33:30.500 --> 33:33.500
You can think of it as the unconditioned in Kant.

33:33.500 --> 33:37.540
A little bit better, you can think of it as Spinoza's God.

33:37.540 --> 33:43.540
Even better, you could think of it as Spinoza's God,

33:43.540 --> 33:45.660
where Spinoza's God is understood neither

33:45.660 --> 33:48.860
determinately as a subject or as an object.

33:48.860 --> 33:52.060
And if that sounds very weird, that's fine.

33:52.060 --> 33:54.820
We'll come back to it.

33:54.820 --> 33:58.420
So the important thing about paragraph 73,

33:58.420 --> 33:59.740
the beginning of the introduction,

33:59.740 --> 34:04.780
is Hegel is playing off various tropes in modern philosophy.

34:04.780 --> 34:07.020
So when you read the beginning of the introduction

34:07.020 --> 34:09.260
of phenomenology, you should think of the beginning

34:09.260 --> 34:11.700
of Locke's essay, concerning the understanding,

34:11.700 --> 34:13.860
or the beginning of conscripti capuris.

34:13.860 --> 34:15.900
The characteristic move of modern philosophy

34:15.900 --> 34:18.700
is before we investigate the object,

34:18.780 --> 34:21.260
we have to investigate the cognitive powers

34:21.260 --> 34:22.660
of the subject.

34:22.660 --> 34:25.900
So what Hegel does now is then riff on various tropes

34:25.900 --> 34:28.500
in modern philosophy.

34:28.500 --> 34:33.460
So he's presenting this thing that you would normally assume.

34:33.460 --> 34:35.340
It is a natural supposition.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.300
Although we'll see that in a certain way,

34:37.300 --> 34:38.940
Hegel doesn't share this supposition.

34:38.940 --> 34:40.700
He's distancing himself from this supposition.

34:40.700 --> 34:42.420
So the natural supposition is, before we

34:42.420 --> 34:45.140
go about the business of knowing objects,

34:45.140 --> 34:49.340
we first have to investigate the power of the knowledge

34:49.340 --> 34:49.840
itself.

34:49.840 --> 34:51.620
We have to know what knowledge is.

34:51.620 --> 34:55.260
So he then riffs on various metaphors

34:55.260 --> 34:58.260
that you find in early modern philosophy.

34:58.260 --> 35:02.660
For one, there might be one rather than another form

35:02.660 --> 35:04.700
of cognition that is better suited to achieving

35:04.700 --> 35:05.380
this final end.

35:05.380 --> 35:08.860
So the idea is, well, you have to decide,

35:08.860 --> 35:11.740
is it the senses that give us knowledge of what is?

35:11.740 --> 35:13.260
Or is it the intellect?

35:13.260 --> 35:14.860
Or is it reason if there's a difference

35:14.860 --> 35:16.220
between the intellect and reason?

35:16.220 --> 35:18.220
Is it faith that gives us knowledge of what is?

35:18.220 --> 35:20.540
So those are the kinds of issues that he's gesturing.

35:23.020 --> 35:26.340
If cognition is a faculty of a determinant kind and scope,

35:26.340 --> 35:28.100
then without a more precise determination

35:28.100 --> 35:30.940
of its nature and limits, one ends up grasping clouds of error

35:30.940 --> 35:32.500
rather than the heaven of truth.

35:32.500 --> 35:35.420
So if knowledge is a particular human ability

35:35.420 --> 35:37.780
among other abilities, then there

35:37.780 --> 35:40.700
are things that that ability can be exercised with respect to

35:40.700 --> 35:42.940
and things that it cannot be exercised with respect to.

35:42.940 --> 35:45.220
So we have to get clarity on that before we

35:45.220 --> 35:48.060
try to go about knowing objects.

35:48.060 --> 35:49.980
If cognition is the instrument for seizing hold

35:49.980 --> 35:52.620
of the absolute, then we don't get the absolute

35:52.620 --> 35:55.060
as it is in itself, but we form and change.

35:55.060 --> 35:58.860
So the idea of, if cognition is something like a tool,

35:58.860 --> 36:02.460
then what it gets us is not the object in itself,

36:02.460 --> 36:05.540
but the object introverse that's shaped by the tool.

36:05.540 --> 36:07.660
So once again, these are not things

36:07.660 --> 36:10.900
I think Hegel needs to put a lot of argumentative weight on.

36:10.900 --> 36:14.980
What he's doing is pointing out that these standard moves

36:14.980 --> 36:19.380
in modern epistemology bring with them these kinds of thoughts.

36:19.380 --> 36:24.460
And he's raising this as a way you could begin in philosophy,

36:24.460 --> 36:26.460
but then also distancing himself by them

36:26.460 --> 36:30.940
by pointing out that those kinds of moves in modern philosophy

36:30.940 --> 36:35.380
bring with them very familiar concerns about whether we'll

36:35.380 --> 36:38.580
ever be able to know reality as it is in itself.

36:38.580 --> 36:40.620
Most importantly, in 1807, the thing that's

36:40.660 --> 36:45.460
always in the back of Hegel's mind is Kant and the idea

36:45.460 --> 36:48.620
that Kant's investigation to the powers of human mind

36:48.620 --> 36:51.220
in the critique of pure reason winds up

36:51.220 --> 36:54.740
proving that we don't know reality as it is in itself.

36:54.740 --> 36:57.220
So he's riffing on all these various thoughts

36:57.220 --> 37:01.900
that if you begin by investigating knowledge

37:01.900 --> 37:07.660
itself, you'll always wind up being distanced from the object

37:07.660 --> 37:10.460
as it is in itself.

37:10.580 --> 37:13.180
Likewise, if we think of knowledge as a passive medium,

37:13.180 --> 37:15.740
well, if you really think through the idea of a passive medium,

37:15.740 --> 37:19.580
a medium kind of changes what passes through it.

37:19.580 --> 37:21.420
And so then you can kind of remove.

37:21.420 --> 37:31.580
So the metaphor is, well, if it's a medium changes,

37:31.580 --> 37:33.380
the light passes into glass.

37:33.380 --> 37:35.140
There's an angle of refraction.

37:35.140 --> 37:41.500
So if we know this, maybe we can infer exactly where

37:41.500 --> 37:43.020
the thing came from.

37:43.020 --> 37:45.100
But then all we'll know is the direction

37:45.100 --> 37:47.140
from which the ray came from.

37:47.140 --> 37:52.860
So Hegel is just riffing on standard metaphors

37:52.860 --> 37:54.980
about knowledge in modern philosophy

37:54.980 --> 37:57.980
and very familiar reasons for thinking

37:57.980 --> 38:00.780
that if you think of knowledge that way,

38:00.780 --> 38:02.860
you will wind up with a conclusion

38:02.860 --> 38:05.460
that you don't know reality as it is itself,

38:05.460 --> 38:07.300
you know it only as it appears to you,

38:07.300 --> 38:10.740
or you know it only in relation to the human mind,

38:10.740 --> 38:11.580
et cetera, et cetera.

38:11.580 --> 38:12.060
Yeah.

38:12.060 --> 38:18.940
So how much we have prior knowledge of the world,

38:18.940 --> 38:23.140
and how he gets to the absoluteness?

38:23.140 --> 38:28.380
Is it relative to us, or is it universal?

38:28.380 --> 38:30.860
We're way too early to get there.

38:30.860 --> 38:34.100
We're at super, super preliminary steps here.

38:34.100 --> 38:36.940
So now I'm going to just, because this is not the last time

38:36.940 --> 38:39.060
I'm on 2016 where I only got 370 pages,

38:39.060 --> 38:41.060
I'm not going to go through sentence by sentence.

38:41.060 --> 38:43.260
I'm going to jump through to particular passages

38:43.260 --> 38:46.060
that I think are eliminated.

38:46.060 --> 38:50.660
So then paragraph 74 begins, and he says, well, look,

38:50.660 --> 38:59.300
if this we could just as well, so let me just read this passage.

38:59.300 --> 39:01.660
If the common concern about falling into error

39:01.660 --> 39:04.660
sets up a mistrust of science, which itself,

39:04.660 --> 39:07.900
untroubled by such scruples, simply sets itself to work

39:07.900 --> 39:10.020
and actually cognizes it, it is still

39:10.020 --> 39:12.140
difficult to say why on the contrary,

39:12.140 --> 39:15.380
a mistrust of this mistrust should not be set up,

39:15.380 --> 39:17.180
and why one should not be concerned

39:17.180 --> 39:21.420
that this fear of erring is already the error itself.

39:21.420 --> 39:24.500
So what he's pointing out is the things that

39:24.500 --> 39:27.580
get us into a mistrust or skepticism

39:27.580 --> 39:31.020
about our ability to know are themselves something

39:31.020 --> 39:33.020
that we could be skeptical about.

39:33.020 --> 39:36.660
In particular, we don't have to assume

39:36.660 --> 39:42.140
that knowledge is an instrument or a tool or a passive media

39:42.140 --> 39:46.380
or one ability among others, that those themselves,

39:46.380 --> 39:50.540
those standard assumptions that structure modern epistemology

39:50.540 --> 39:53.340
and that lead to the conclusion that we don't know realities

39:53.420 --> 39:58.980
of itself are themselves something that is questionable.

39:58.980 --> 40:03.660
Skipping a little bit, but above all, this picture

40:03.660 --> 40:06.580
that he's been somewhat satirically riffing on

40:06.580 --> 40:10.580
presupposes that the absolute stands on one side

40:10.580 --> 40:13.780
and that cognition stands on the other or itself

40:13.780 --> 40:16.820
and separated from the absolute, though cognition is

40:16.820 --> 40:18.660
nevertheless something real.

40:18.660 --> 40:20.980
So what he's saying is the assumption here

40:20.980 --> 40:25.940
in all of this stuff, let's just once again, for now,

40:25.940 --> 40:30.020
treat the absolute as the object of knowledge.

40:30.020 --> 40:37.900
The assumption is I'm over here, the object is a distinct being,

40:37.900 --> 40:45.020
and then somehow I have to overcome this distinctness

40:45.020 --> 40:46.740
in order to know.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.620
And the standard early modern thought

40:48.620 --> 40:52.900
is, well, how could I know an object that's distinct for me?

40:52.900 --> 40:57.420
Well, it would have to affect me, have to affect my senses.

40:57.420 --> 40:59.180
And I would have to have some capacity

40:59.180 --> 41:02.380
to be affected sensorily by it.

41:02.380 --> 41:06.020
And then all of these early modern worries

41:06.020 --> 41:08.980
from Locke, Hume, Kant, Descartes, everyone else,

41:08.980 --> 41:15.220
arise, namely, would that allow us to know the object as it is

41:15.220 --> 41:17.580
or only as it affects us?

41:17.580 --> 41:20.380
Would it allow us to know the way the object really is

41:20.380 --> 41:22.740
or only as it appears to our senses?

41:22.740 --> 41:27.860
So he's pointing out that that very standard picture

41:27.860 --> 41:32.300
of knowledge as a particular relation of one being

41:32.300 --> 41:36.940
to another, or let's say, a capacity that one being has

41:36.940 --> 41:39.860
to know another being or other beings,

41:39.860 --> 41:43.140
is itself something we can question.

41:43.140 --> 41:45.580
We're not stuck with that.

41:45.580 --> 41:47.660
OK.

41:47.660 --> 41:49.980
I'm going to skip 73.

41:49.980 --> 41:50.940
OK.

41:50.940 --> 41:54.980
So now he says, look, instead of fussing around with answers

41:54.980 --> 41:57.780
to all of this, that is to say, instead of fussing around

41:57.780 --> 42:03.540
with the whole problem space of early modern epistemology,

42:03.540 --> 42:06.300
empiricism, rationalism, sensibility, understanding,

42:06.300 --> 42:08.920
reason, instead of all of that, instead of fussing around

42:08.920 --> 42:10.700
with answers to all of this, it is

42:10.700 --> 42:12.940
possible to reject these outright

42:12.940 --> 42:16.420
as contingent and arbitrary representations

42:16.420 --> 42:18.540
and to regard the affiliated use of words,

42:18.540 --> 42:22.100
such as absolute cognition, and also objective and subjective,

42:22.100 --> 42:24.020
and countless others, whose meaning is assumed

42:24.020 --> 42:27.020
to be generally known as even a kind of deceit.

42:27.020 --> 42:29.060
So one thing we can do is step back and say,

42:29.060 --> 42:32.900
the meaning of subject, object, cognition, absolutely,

42:32.900 --> 42:35.660
they themselves are things that have to be determined.

42:35.660 --> 42:37.860
It's not self-evident what these things mean,

42:37.860 --> 42:41.980
and it's not self-evident that we have to begin philosophy

42:41.980 --> 42:44.220
by assuming a particular meaning of them

42:44.220 --> 42:46.660
or a particular set up for epistemology, namely,

42:46.660 --> 42:50.620
that one, skipping a little bit.

42:50.620 --> 42:53.060
They constitute only an empty appearance

42:53.060 --> 42:55.340
of a knowing, which immediately vanishes

42:55.340 --> 42:58.860
in the face of the science, which comes onto the scene.

42:58.860 --> 42:59.380
OK.

42:59.380 --> 43:02.820
So just a little note about language.

43:02.820 --> 43:04.220
Bissen is to know.

43:07.420 --> 43:11.860
Bissenschaft is science.

43:11.860 --> 43:14.980
But that means just etymologically in German,

43:14.980 --> 43:19.020
there's a very close connection between Bissen and Bissenschaft.

43:19.020 --> 43:24.740
So for now, Hegel has a very distinctive notion

43:24.740 --> 43:26.740
of what a Bissenschaft is.

43:26.740 --> 43:28.020
He hasn't developed it yet.

43:28.020 --> 43:30.580
So let's just take on board the idea

43:30.580 --> 43:35.820
that if the aim of philosophy is to know, to have Bissen,

43:35.820 --> 43:38.500
the aim of philosophy is to be a Bissenschaft,

43:38.500 --> 43:42.460
that is to say, to be a science, a body of knowing.

43:42.460 --> 43:44.660
Now, this is unnatural in English

43:44.660 --> 43:46.340
because we have two different words.

43:46.340 --> 43:48.660
And because we have this, frankly,

43:48.660 --> 43:52.100
stupid tendency in English to assume that the word science

43:52.100 --> 43:55.340
only applies to the natural sciences.

43:55.340 --> 43:57.260
That just doesn't make sense in German.

43:57.260 --> 43:59.060
In German, the study of literature

43:59.060 --> 44:01.020
is the Tsozwe Bissenschaft, the study of politics

44:01.020 --> 44:03.100
is Politische Bissenschaft.

44:03.100 --> 44:07.940
Any systematically ordered body of knowledge is Bissenschaft.

44:07.940 --> 44:10.460
So the introduction of science at this point

44:10.460 --> 44:13.980
is not as arbitrary as it seems, although over the course

44:13.980 --> 44:17.140
of the system, we'll get a much, much richer notion of science.

44:17.140 --> 44:20.700
So all that Hegel is doing is saying, look,

44:20.700 --> 44:22.380
it's standard to begin by assuming

44:22.380 --> 44:26.140
that we want in philosophy is knowledge,

44:26.140 --> 44:28.740
that is to say, scientific knowing, science,

44:28.740 --> 44:30.380
of what actually is.

44:30.380 --> 44:33.340
And the standard way we begin is by assuming this.

44:33.340 --> 44:35.980
But this leads very quickly by arguments

44:36.020 --> 44:38.420
that are familiar from early modern philosophy

44:38.420 --> 44:41.140
to the conclusion that we don't know objects

44:41.140 --> 44:42.260
as they are in themselves.

44:42.260 --> 44:46.380
We only know their appearances or other structural features.

44:46.380 --> 44:48.700
Or even more radically, in Hume, in some way,

44:48.700 --> 44:51.020
we don't really know anything other than our own impressions

44:51.020 --> 44:53.300
of objects.

44:53.300 --> 44:56.660
But we don't have to assume that because it's not obvious

44:56.660 --> 44:59.340
what any of these terms mean.

44:59.340 --> 45:00.660
OK.

45:00.660 --> 45:03.540
But then he says, all of this vanishes

45:03.540 --> 45:04.860
when science comes on the scene.

45:04.860 --> 45:09.340
So when someone who has scientific knowing,

45:09.340 --> 45:12.300
who knows what, in actuality, is the case,

45:12.300 --> 45:15.020
and does so scientifically, when they show up,

45:15.020 --> 45:17.860
all of the rest of this is revealed to be deceit.

45:17.860 --> 45:22.660
But science, insofar as it comes on the scene,

45:22.660 --> 45:24.660
is itself an appearance.

45:24.660 --> 45:28.140
Science is coming onto the scene is not yet science

45:28.140 --> 45:31.260
as it is carried out and unfolded in its truth.

45:31.260 --> 45:36.740
So if I don't have knowledge, I just

45:36.740 --> 45:41.220
have various beliefs involving these concepts.

45:41.220 --> 45:44.540
I'm just a standard early modern epistemology person.

45:44.540 --> 45:47.780
And someone comes on the scene who does have knowing,

45:47.780 --> 45:50.700
that's just one more claim to knowledge among others.

45:50.700 --> 45:53.700
We don't yet know who has knowledge.

45:53.700 --> 45:56.900
Merely, the first appearance of knowing,

45:56.900 --> 45:59.180
the first person who knows, doesn't necessarily

45:59.180 --> 46:01.100
know that they know.

46:01.100 --> 46:03.820
So Hegel goes on to say, for with regard

46:03.820 --> 46:05.980
to a knowing that is not truthful,

46:05.980 --> 46:09.700
science cannot simply reject it as just a common view of things

46:09.700 --> 46:12.420
while giving out the assurance that it is itself

46:12.420 --> 46:14.620
a completely different kind of cognition

46:14.620 --> 46:17.060
and that the other knowing counts as absolutely nothing

46:17.060 --> 46:19.260
for science.

46:19.260 --> 46:22.620
Skip the rest of the sentence, through such an assurance,

46:22.620 --> 46:25.420
science declares its being to be its power.

46:25.420 --> 46:28.540
But untrue knowing, just as much appeals to the fact

46:28.700 --> 46:33.100
that it is, and it gives out the assurance that science counts

46:33.100 --> 46:36.820
as nothing to it, but one bear assurance

46:36.820 --> 46:38.500
is just as valid as another.

46:38.500 --> 46:40.300
So bear assurance is the old translation.

46:40.300 --> 46:42.540
It just sounds better.

46:42.540 --> 46:43.820
It's perfectly fine.

46:43.820 --> 46:44.780
So what does that mean?

46:44.780 --> 46:49.620
What it means is, if you don't know but have mere opinion,

46:49.620 --> 46:56.380
and I come on the scene and I know,

46:56.380 --> 47:01.220
my assertion that I know is worth just as much

47:01.220 --> 47:06.260
as your assertion that you know, even if I know.

47:06.260 --> 47:10.860
So the issue here is how we know what knowledge is,

47:10.860 --> 47:15.180
or how we justify our epistemic standard.

47:15.180 --> 47:19.740
So the issue is not knowledge of objects.

47:19.740 --> 47:22.580
It's knowledge of what knowledge is.

47:22.580 --> 47:26.780
So the idea is, it's not enough simply to know,

47:26.780 --> 47:30.380
because your claim to know is just a mere assertion,

47:30.380 --> 47:34.980
a bear assurance, just as valid and just as invalid

47:34.980 --> 47:38.980
as the person who doesn't actually know their claim to know.

47:38.980 --> 47:41.020
So we need to find somewhere to adjudicate

47:41.020 --> 47:46.660
between the mere claim to knowledge, mere opinion,

47:46.660 --> 47:48.420
and knowledge.

47:48.460 --> 47:51.940
So knowing is agreement?

47:51.940 --> 47:53.260
Argument?

47:53.260 --> 47:54.180
Agreement.

47:54.180 --> 47:55.740
Agreement, no.

47:55.740 --> 47:57.500
OK.

47:57.500 --> 47:59.260
Skipping a bit, 77.

47:59.260 --> 48:03.100
Because this exposition has for its object only

48:03.100 --> 48:05.780
knowing as it appears.

48:05.780 --> 48:07.420
So what we're going to do is we're

48:07.420 --> 48:09.620
going to look at appearances of knowledge.

48:09.620 --> 48:12.460
That is to say, claims to know.

48:12.460 --> 48:15.660
But once again, we're not interested in particular.

48:15.660 --> 48:19.020
I claim to know that Bismarck is the capital of South Dakota.

48:19.020 --> 48:22.780
I claim to know that Fargo is not the capital of South Dakota.

48:22.780 --> 48:26.420
Maybe someone, some poor, benated, Canadian,

48:26.420 --> 48:30.900
ignorant of the geography of the Upper Midwest, my homeland,

48:30.900 --> 48:34.980
might claim to know falsely that Fargo is the capital of South

48:34.980 --> 48:35.660
Dakota.

48:35.660 --> 48:38.300
It is not.

48:38.300 --> 48:40.140
We're not interested in that.

48:40.140 --> 48:45.420
We're interested in the sort of one level more general

48:45.500 --> 48:50.060
about what you think knowledge is.

48:50.060 --> 48:54.340
So the exposition has for its object only knowing as it appears.

48:54.340 --> 49:00.260
That is to say, appearances of conceptions of knowledge.

49:00.260 --> 49:02.340
So you have a conception of what knowledge is.

49:02.340 --> 49:05.300
I have a conception of what knowledge is.

49:05.300 --> 49:10.580
Even if my conception is right, let's just assume yours is right.

49:10.580 --> 49:13.860
My claim about what knowledge is is just as valid as yours.

49:13.860 --> 49:16.740
One is just to bear assurance just as much as the other.

49:16.740 --> 49:19.180
It does not itself seem to be the science, which

49:19.180 --> 49:23.100
is free and self-moving within its own proper shape.

49:23.100 --> 49:27.620
So this exposition does not itself seem to be the science.

49:27.620 --> 49:32.100
So when Hegel says something doesn't appear or merely appears,

49:32.100 --> 49:33.620
that's really important.

49:33.620 --> 49:37.340
So he's saying you would think at the beginning

49:37.340 --> 49:39.820
this exposition is not going to be science

49:39.820 --> 49:41.660
because we don't know what science is yet.

49:41.660 --> 49:43.660
We don't know what knowledge is.

49:43.780 --> 49:46.820
It will actually turn out to be more complicated than that later on.

49:46.820 --> 49:49.500
But let's just take the appearance at face value for now.

49:49.500 --> 49:54.420
So this exposition where there's an appearance of knowing

49:54.420 --> 49:57.940
is just someone's claim to knowing backed up

49:57.940 --> 50:00.540
by some conception of knowledge.

50:00.540 --> 50:02.700
That doesn't look to be knowing yet because they

50:02.700 --> 50:04.940
don't know that they know.

50:04.940 --> 50:06.700
But from this standpoint can instead

50:06.700 --> 50:10.540
be taken to be the path of natural consciousness,

50:10.540 --> 50:13.300
pressing forward towards true knowing.

50:13.820 --> 50:17.420
It can be taken to be the path of the soul wandering

50:17.420 --> 50:19.900
through this series of ways it takes shape,

50:19.900 --> 50:23.340
as if these were stations put forward in advance to it

50:23.340 --> 50:27.900
by its own nature so that it purifies itself into spirit

50:27.900 --> 50:31.980
by arriving at a cognition of what it is in itself

50:31.980 --> 50:35.420
through the complete experience of its own self.

50:35.420 --> 50:39.940
So that description, 77 is a description of this book.

50:39.980 --> 50:44.660
It's an exposition, which appears not to be science

50:44.660 --> 50:46.780
itself yet, and let's stick with the appearance.

50:46.780 --> 50:50.220
Let's assume that this is from the first page not yet science,

50:50.220 --> 50:52.740
but merely the appearance of science.

50:52.740 --> 50:56.180
But what it really is is it's the path of natural consciousness.

50:56.180 --> 50:57.700
So what is natural consciousness?

50:57.700 --> 51:00.860
It's something like the conception of knowledge

51:00.860 --> 51:03.860
we begin with pre-philosophically.

51:03.860 --> 51:06.660
Very roughly, it's this.

51:06.660 --> 51:08.900
It's the idea that there's a distinction

51:08.900 --> 51:13.380
between consciousness, the subject,

51:13.380 --> 51:16.500
and its other, the object, and that consciousness

51:16.500 --> 51:19.060
has to somehow overcome that, maybe

51:19.060 --> 51:22.300
by the object affecting its senses, et cetera, et cetera.

51:22.300 --> 51:25.340
This is natural consciousness.

51:30.660 --> 51:32.780
So the exposition, this book is going

51:32.780 --> 51:37.820
to be an exposition of the path of natural consciousness

51:37.820 --> 51:42.140
pressing forwards towards true known, towards science.

51:42.140 --> 51:44.980
Or it can be taken to be the path of the soul wandering

51:44.980 --> 51:47.460
through the series of ways it takes shape.

51:47.460 --> 51:49.660
So the phenomenology of this will

51:49.660 --> 51:52.940
be an exposition of different shapes or forms

51:52.940 --> 51:56.940
of consciousness, which means different conceptions

51:56.940 --> 51:59.740
of what knowledge is, different conceptions

51:59.740 --> 52:04.540
of the relationship between consciousness and its object.

52:04.540 --> 52:07.780
As if these were stations put forward in advance to it

52:07.780 --> 52:09.340
by its own nature.

52:09.340 --> 52:12.420
So these stations, these different forms of consciousness,

52:12.420 --> 52:14.380
are not given to it from outside,

52:14.380 --> 52:18.460
but they develop out of it itself,

52:18.460 --> 52:21.780
so that it purifies itself into spirit

52:21.780 --> 52:25.140
by arriving at a cognition of what it is in itself

52:25.140 --> 52:28.140
through the complete experience of its own self.

52:28.140 --> 52:31.140
So this is going to be the exposition

52:31.140 --> 52:34.980
of how natural consciousness becomes spirit,

52:34.980 --> 52:40.300
and therefore truly knows itself and has scientific knowledge.

52:40.300 --> 52:42.340
Now, what is this exposition?

52:42.340 --> 52:46.820
What is the character of the exposition of the phenomenology?

52:46.820 --> 52:50.060
So one very standard way of reading the phenomenology

52:50.060 --> 52:53.780
that I think is totally wrong is to think of it

52:53.780 --> 53:01.740
as an historical description of various shapes of human

53:01.740 --> 53:03.100
consciousness over time.

53:03.100 --> 53:05.220
So on this reading, some of the beginning of the book

53:05.220 --> 53:07.740
is like Stone Age consciousness, and by the end

53:07.740 --> 53:10.380
we have like early 19th century German consciousness.

53:10.380 --> 53:13.820
This has various problems, one of which

53:13.820 --> 53:16.900
is it gets the chronology as out of order.

53:16.900 --> 53:21.980
So somehow like Newtonian science comes before the Greeks.

53:22.180 --> 53:23.940
There are other problems with it, namely,

53:23.940 --> 53:26.020
it makes the whole book completely incoherent.

53:26.020 --> 53:32.540
It turns it into the world's most incoherently written

53:32.540 --> 53:34.100
piece of intellectual history.

53:34.100 --> 53:38.380
It's like Will Durant, as written by Hegel.

53:38.380 --> 53:40.100
And it also completely undermines

53:40.100 --> 53:43.460
the philosophical account, because what happened does not

53:43.460 --> 53:46.020
in and of itself have any necessity.

53:46.020 --> 53:47.660
So I don't think that it's historical.

53:47.660 --> 53:49.700
I think that this exposition is a purely

53:49.700 --> 53:52.300
philosophical or logical.

53:52.300 --> 53:56.180
So what we do is we start with natural consciousness, which

53:56.180 --> 53:58.220
is a conception of what knowing is.

53:58.220 --> 54:00.380
It's roughly this.

54:00.380 --> 54:02.540
As we'll see, it's going to start even more minimally

54:02.540 --> 54:03.020
than this.

54:13.420 --> 54:15.500
We're going to start with this, and then we're

54:15.500 --> 54:19.500
going to develop out of this other shapes of consciousness,

54:19.620 --> 54:22.540
other conceptions of what knowledge is,

54:22.540 --> 54:27.940
till we get to what Hegel identifies as science, what

54:27.940 --> 54:31.980
he identifies as the knowing of the absolute,

54:31.980 --> 54:36.540
and what he here identifies as consciousness becoming spirit.

54:36.540 --> 54:40.620
Now, all of those things are going to be the same.

54:40.620 --> 54:43.020
They're all going to be identical.

54:43.020 --> 54:45.140
But let me just say something about the latter.

54:45.140 --> 54:47.740
What does it mean that consciousness becomes spirit?

54:47.740 --> 54:50.460
As Hegel says at the end of 77, it's

54:50.460 --> 54:54.620
not that consciousness wasn't spirit and then becomes spirit.

54:54.620 --> 54:58.660
It's that consciousness becomes aware of itself as spirit.

54:58.660 --> 55:01.420
So one way of thinking about the phenomenology, the one

55:01.420 --> 55:05.180
that I'm going to emphasize, is its consciousness developing

55:05.180 --> 55:07.660
out of itself a series of shapes of consciousness,

55:07.660 --> 55:10.140
conceptions of knowing, until it gets to one

55:10.140 --> 55:13.660
that is knowing, full stop.

55:13.660 --> 55:16.940
True scientific knowing of what in actuality is.

55:16.940 --> 55:20.860
That will turn out also to be knowledge of the absolute.

55:20.860 --> 55:24.780
For the preview of incredibly weird Hegel stuff to come,

55:24.780 --> 55:28.020
it will turn out that that is the absolute.

55:28.020 --> 55:30.580
The absolute is the absolute knowing itself.

55:30.580 --> 55:31.860
And you can be part of it too.

55:35.740 --> 55:39.020
But the thing I just want to mention now

55:39.020 --> 55:41.220
is it will also be consciousness coming

55:41.220 --> 55:44.980
to know what it itself is, namely, spirit.

55:47.300 --> 55:50.620
Now we're going to talk a lot more about spirit in this class

55:50.620 --> 55:52.660
because it's one of the three parts of the system.

55:52.660 --> 55:59.060
And we'll spend roughly half this whole semester on spirit.

55:59.060 --> 56:06.660
What exactly spirit is in Hegel is if you gave me a pop quiz

56:06.660 --> 56:08.980
and gave me a blue book and said you have three hours to say

56:08.980 --> 56:11.100
what spirit is for Hegel, I think

56:11.100 --> 56:12.660
I would throw myself out of a window.

56:12.660 --> 56:14.740
I don't really know how I would do that.

56:14.740 --> 56:20.340
But let me just say very briefly something about the word.

56:20.340 --> 56:24.660
The word in German is geist.

56:24.660 --> 56:25.500
OK.

56:25.500 --> 56:28.460
Now, sometimes that gets translated in English

56:28.460 --> 56:32.900
as spirit, sometimes it gets translated as mind.

56:32.900 --> 56:34.460
So in particular, the translation

56:34.460 --> 56:35.960
of the philosophy of spirit that we're

56:35.960 --> 56:39.300
going to read, the only one ever published in English

56:39.300 --> 56:42.660
because Cambridge underpaid the editorial board,

56:42.740 --> 56:45.700
translated as the philosophy of mind.

56:45.700 --> 56:50.540
Now, what is the relationship between spirit and mind?

56:50.540 --> 56:53.060
They're the same word in German.

56:53.060 --> 56:55.580
If you want to say that someone lost his mind in German,

56:55.580 --> 56:58.060
you say, he hasein geistfel.

56:58.060 --> 57:02.260
So we have two words where the Germans have won.

57:02.260 --> 57:06.540
Now, Hegel is exploiting a feature of German, which

57:06.540 --> 57:12.220
is that the word that you would use for my individual mind,

57:12.820 --> 57:14.740
is also the word that you would use

57:14.740 --> 57:19.260
for collective mental phenomena, like the spirit of the age.

57:19.260 --> 57:24.660
If you say in English, the mind of the 19th century,

57:24.660 --> 57:26.340
people will be like, what?

57:26.340 --> 57:27.020
What's that like?

57:27.020 --> 57:28.220
That sounds like the board.

57:28.220 --> 57:29.940
Everyone in the 19th century was hooked up

57:29.940 --> 57:32.420
into some big telepathic worldwide web.

57:32.420 --> 57:37.100
Now, if you say zeitgeist, the spirit of the age in German,

57:37.100 --> 57:38.300
that sounds totally normal.

57:38.300 --> 57:40.460
So what Hegel is playing on the fact

57:40.460 --> 57:44.660
that there's one word for individual mental phenomena

57:44.660 --> 57:46.380
and collective mental phenomena.

57:46.380 --> 57:49.340
Because what he wants us to see is

57:49.340 --> 57:52.140
that those aren't really separate things.

57:52.140 --> 57:55.660
Not that there's only one mind and we're all parts of it,

57:55.660 --> 58:00.060
or that the collective mind is just the combination

58:00.060 --> 58:02.220
of the little minds, as Margaret Thatcher famously said,

58:02.220 --> 58:03.860
there's no such thing as society.

58:03.860 --> 58:05.860
But neither of those views.

58:05.860 --> 58:09.860
As always in Hegel, a third weirder thing.

58:09.860 --> 58:13.300
But just very briefly, what matters

58:13.300 --> 58:16.180
in the phenomenology of spirit is

58:16.180 --> 58:19.100
that over the course of the phenomenology,

58:19.100 --> 58:23.540
consciousness comes to realize that it's spirit.

58:23.540 --> 58:25.780
Consciousness comes to realize that it's a mind.

58:25.780 --> 58:26.740
No, no, no.

58:26.740 --> 58:30.380
He means spirit in a more technical sense.

58:30.380 --> 58:32.540
Consciousness will come to realize

58:32.540 --> 58:36.740
that there is no difference between it and its author.

58:36.740 --> 58:41.700
Spirit is mind in so far as it understands

58:41.700 --> 58:43.780
that it has no other.

58:43.780 --> 58:46.780
Now that is not going to mean that everything is spirit.

58:46.780 --> 58:50.500
So Hegel's view is not like this is spirit.

58:50.500 --> 58:54.660
Hegel's fully aware that there is no spirit on the moon.

58:54.660 --> 58:57.740
The view that the phenomenology is building up towards

58:57.740 --> 59:03.820
is that the other of spirit, nature, things that have reality

59:03.820 --> 59:07.260
but aren't minds, are not fundamentally

59:07.260 --> 59:08.940
different from spirit.

59:08.940 --> 59:12.420
So that although spirit has another,

59:12.420 --> 59:14.860
its other isn't fundamentally other to it.

59:14.860 --> 59:18.780
Or it's the same structurally as spirit.

59:18.780 --> 59:20.060
Now this is all provisional.

59:20.060 --> 59:22.060
All of this is going to be worked out

59:22.060 --> 59:23.220
in the rest of the system.

59:23.220 --> 59:27.740
But the basic idea is that spirit is consciousness

59:27.740 --> 59:30.660
raised to the point where it understands

59:30.660 --> 59:35.460
that the basic structure in which consciousness thinks

59:35.460 --> 59:38.620
is the same structure as what it thinks about.

59:38.620 --> 59:41.660
So although there's a difference between myself and the object,

59:41.660 --> 59:43.180
it's not an ultimate difference.

59:43.180 --> 59:47.900
The way I think about things is fundamentally the way they are.

59:47.900 --> 59:49.660
And what's important for Hegel is

59:49.660 --> 59:51.620
that we're going to prove that.

59:51.620 --> 59:53.740
We're not going to presuppose it.

59:53.740 --> 59:56.900
Hegel's way of thinking about this, preconti and rationalism

59:56.900 --> 01:00:00.700
just presupposes that the categories of thought,

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:03.500
basically subject, predicate, and logic,

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.860
are the metaphysical structure of being.

01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:07.620
Or they assume something even worse,

01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:10.500
which is that God just decided, because he's

01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:12.980
nice, to set things up that way.

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.500
Because what God really cares about

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:17.340
is that we do metaphysics properly.

01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:20.100
The murder of innocence and the complete slaughter field

01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:22.740
that is history was relatively different to him.

01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.580
He was figuring out how to create the world.

01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:26.980
But he was like, wait, if I do it this way,

01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:29.540
there's going to be all these genocides and all this slavery

01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:30.620
and all this horrible shit.

01:00:30.620 --> 01:00:32.740
But they'll be able to do metaphysics.

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.660
Yes, I'll do that.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.980
So Hegel thinks that's even worse.

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:40.100
So what we need to do over the course of the system

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:43.740
is show that consciousness has to be spirit.

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:46.540
That is to say, there can't be a fundamental difference

01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:51.980
between the categories in which thought thinks and the beings

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:52.980
that it thinks about.

01:00:52.980 --> 01:00:54.860
And so that's going to mean that there's

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:56.900
a structural identity between spirit and nature.

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.180
Yes?

01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:00.940
The individual mental phenomena,

01:01:00.940 --> 01:01:03.740
collective mental phenomena, are key names

01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:07.580
or is it too much experience?

01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:09.740
You're getting ahead of us.

01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:10.980
We're not there yet.

01:01:10.980 --> 01:01:11.940
Yeah, Isaac, right.

01:01:11.940 --> 01:01:12.740
Yeah.

01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:15.140
So is there any comparable traits

01:01:15.140 --> 01:01:16.980
between the non-monetary atmosphere

01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:20.180
and the non-monology of this technology in 20th century?

01:01:20.180 --> 01:01:22.740
Is there any connection at all?

01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:24.340
I will answer that question when we

01:01:24.340 --> 01:01:26.980
get to a particular passage.

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.900
Notice the word phenomenology has not been used yet.

01:01:30.900 --> 01:01:34.140
Maybe a bit naive, but why start with natural consciousness?

01:01:34.140 --> 01:01:35.660
We will get there.

01:01:35.660 --> 01:01:36.140
Yeah?

01:01:36.140 --> 01:01:38.620
What is the concept of what is the notion?

01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:42.620
Oh, it's the bad old English translation of the concept.

01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:44.740
To the next question, what is the concept?

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:48.460
That's, we will, it's going to take us a couple weeks.

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:49.460
But it doesn't use it here.

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:52.060
He uses it here, but he uses it in a non-technical sense

01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:54.460
here to mean something like one's conception.

01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:55.460
OK.

01:01:55.460 --> 01:01:56.460
Yeah.

01:01:56.460 --> 01:01:59.700
I know you said consciousness realizes that it's spirit.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:04.420
Maybe it's a silly question, but what's the difference

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:07.260
before we know, before I as a consciousness realize

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:08.740
that I am spirit?

01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.780
What is the difference between spirit and consciousness?

01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:15.220
It's the difference between being something

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.940
and being aware of yourself as being that.

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.500
So your spirit all along.

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:22.660
Where consciousness is always spirit,

01:02:22.660 --> 01:02:25.300
but it doesn't grasp itself as spirit.

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:28.060
Or I mean, once again, it's important not

01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:29.980
to think of this temporally.

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.620
This is not about a guy named consciousness

01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:35.020
who realizes at the end that he's spirit.

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:36.780
It's about consciousness.

01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:40.380
And consciousness is spirit, but at the level

01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:44.180
at which we describe consciousness at the beginning,

01:02:44.180 --> 01:02:47.220
that is not a description of consciousness as spirit.

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:49.820
What we're going to do is unfold from that description

01:02:49.820 --> 01:02:52.100
of consciousness, just from what consciousness is so

01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:54.460
described that it must be spirit.

01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:56.140
OK.

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:56.900
Moving on.

01:02:56.900 --> 01:02:58.660
Natural consciousness will prove

01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.860
to be only the concept of knowing,

01:03:00.860 --> 01:03:02.580
or it will prove to be not real knowing.

01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:03.100
OK, good.

01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:05.340
So this is a non-technical use of concept.

01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:06.740
This is something like what we mean

01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:08.220
by concept in the ordinary sense.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:09.500
It's a conception of knowing.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:12.500
So natural consciousness thinks of itself as knowing,

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.100
and it has a conception of knowing, namely this one.

01:03:15.100 --> 01:03:17.780
But it will prove to be not real knowing.

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.580
He also said already for that.

01:03:19.660 --> 01:03:22.940
While it immediately regards itself rather as real knowing,

01:03:22.940 --> 01:03:25.380
this path has negative meaning for it.

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.380
And what is the realization of the concept

01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:30.500
will count instead to it as the loss of itself,

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:34.460
for on this path, it loses its truth.

01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:36.900
In this exposition, consciousness

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:40.860
is going to realize that what it thinks knowing is is not

01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:41.740
knowing.

01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:45.420
So the truth that it thinks it knows, it doesn't know.

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.380
This path could accordingly be regarded

01:03:47.380 --> 01:03:50.220
as the path of doubt, or more properly,

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:52.500
as the path of despair.

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:55.140
On this path, what happens is not

01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:57.620
what is customarily understood as doubt,

01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:00.180
a shaking of this or that supposed truth,

01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:02.500
followed by the disappearance again of the doubt,

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:05.300
and then a return to the former, so that in the end,

01:04:05.300 --> 01:04:07.940
the thing at issue is taken as it was before.

01:04:07.940 --> 01:04:10.780
Rather, this path is the conscious insight

01:04:10.780 --> 01:04:13.540
into the untruth of knowing as it appears.

01:04:13.540 --> 01:04:16.860
A knowing for which that which is the most real

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:21.540
is rather in truth only the unrealized concept.

01:04:21.540 --> 01:04:24.660
So what that means is consciousness

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:27.620
is going to realize, not that it's wrong about it

01:04:27.620 --> 01:04:29.980
thought it knew something, but it didn't know that thing.

01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:32.620
It thought it knew that Fargo is the capital of North Dakota,

01:04:32.620 --> 01:04:33.140
but it isn't.

01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:39.900
Or it's nor is it going to doubt, it's

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:42.860
going to say, well, there's a bunch of stuff I don't know.

01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:45.300
I don't know anything about how things are in themselves.

01:04:45.380 --> 01:04:47.060
I didn't know the external world.

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:50.860
What it's going to doubt is its conception of knowledge.

01:04:50.860 --> 01:04:54.900
And that is the loss of itself, because a conception

01:04:54.900 --> 01:04:57.340
of knowledge is a conception by consciousness

01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:59.180
of what consciousness is.

01:04:59.180 --> 01:05:02.420
So in losing that, it loses itself.

01:05:02.420 --> 01:05:05.180
So there's this kind of existential dimension.

01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:08.780
These are losses of self-conceptions.

01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:13.140
So the phenomenology is also an exposition

01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:15.100
of a sequence of self-conceptions

01:05:15.100 --> 01:05:18.740
that consciousness might have of itself.

01:05:18.740 --> 01:05:20.940
I'm going to skip a bunch.

01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:23.300
So we know where we start, natural consciousness.

01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:25.740
Although we don't really know what natural consciousness is,

01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:27.900
this is my preliminary sketch of it.

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:30.540
He hasn't really told us what natural consciousness is.

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:33.500
We know roughly where things are going to end.

01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:38.100
They're going to end with scientific knowledge,

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:41.500
where whatever doubt is generated

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.580
about these models of knowledge,

01:05:43.580 --> 01:05:45.900
that will not be able to be generated anymore.

01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:48.540
We don't really know why.

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:52.140
The completeness of the forms of non-real consciousness

01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:54.380
will emerge through the very necessity

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.860
of their progression and their interrelations.

01:05:56.860 --> 01:05:59.700
The progression of one form of consciousness,

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:01.780
one conception of knowledge to another,

01:06:01.780 --> 01:06:04.700
is going to be necessary, not contingent.

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.340
To make this comprehensible, it can

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:08.620
be noted in general at the outset

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:11.540
that the exposition of non-truthful consciousness

01:06:11.540 --> 01:06:15.220
in its untruth is not merely a negative movement.

01:06:15.220 --> 01:06:19.020
So Hegel now needs to explain why we transition

01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:21.660
from one shape of consciousness to the next.

01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:26.100
Now, rereading the introduction today,

01:06:26.100 --> 01:06:29.740
I think this is, I came to the conclusion

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:32.300
this text is not actually in the best order

01:06:32.300 --> 01:06:35.740
that it could be in, because only a little bit later

01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:39.180
will he explain exactly how consciousness

01:06:39.180 --> 01:06:41.220
undermines a shape of consciousness.

01:06:41.220 --> 01:06:42.660
But let's set that aside.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.620
Let's assume there's some notion of consciousness

01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:48.420
realizing that its conception of knowledge is wrong.

01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:52.700
Now we need to understand how it moves to the next one.

01:06:52.700 --> 01:06:55.340
Now, I just want to emphasize one thing,

01:06:55.340 --> 01:07:00.180
that this is a process, or this development,

01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:02.500
is not about particular knowledge claims.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.700
We're not interested in particular knowledge

01:07:04.740 --> 01:07:06.740
claims about particular objects.

01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:09.220
It's at the level of a whole epistemology,

01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:11.540
a whole conception of what knowledge is.

01:07:11.540 --> 01:07:13.380
That's what's getting under it.

01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:16.260
That's why doubt about that is the loss

01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:18.340
of consciousness itself.

01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:20.620
If you find out that you thought you knew

01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:22.860
that South Dakota was the capital of,

01:07:22.860 --> 01:07:25.260
sorry, that Fargo was the capital of South Dakota,

01:07:25.260 --> 01:07:27.180
and then you find out you're wrong,

01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:28.300
you don't lose yourself in that,

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:29.700
unless you have way more invested

01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:32.900
in the geography of the Upper Midwest than you should.

01:07:32.900 --> 01:07:34.740
Assuming that we're counting as the Dakotas

01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:36.420
as part of the Midwest, which, okay,

01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:37.620
we can debate about that.

01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:41.500
You guys are probably not as invested

01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.860
in inter-Midwest rivalry as I am.

01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:49.540
But that's how we learn from each other.

01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:53.260
Okay, so it's not merely a negative movement.

01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:56.300
So when consciousness realizes

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:59.500
that its conception of knowledge is false,

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.660
that isn't, it doesn't merely reject it.

01:08:02.620 --> 01:08:05.100
It's not just like not that.

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:07.980
However, only when taken as the nothing

01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:12.340
of that from which it is, from which it emerges,

01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.940
is the nothing, in fact, the true result.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:17.580
Thus, it is itself a determinate nothing,

01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:19.420
and it has a content.

01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:22.460
So when consciousness undermines

01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:25.220
some shape of consciousness, some conception of knowledge,

01:08:25.220 --> 01:08:27.900
the result is not just pure,

01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:29.860
just the abandonment of knowing.

01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:31.660
Not just pure nothing.

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:34.700
It's a specific or determinate negative nothing.

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.980
It's the rejection of that previous shape,

01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:40.580
which is itself its own shape.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:44.820
So what Hegel needs to do is give us a principled reason

01:08:44.820 --> 01:08:48.860
or a function for why one shape of consciousness

01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:51.860
undermines itself and gives rise to the next.

01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:54.420
So there has to be, so to speak, a law of the series.

01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:56.260
So we have an account of where we start,

01:08:56.260 --> 01:08:57.340
we have a kind of preliminary account

01:08:57.340 --> 01:08:58.500
of where we're gonna end,

01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:02.260
but we also have an account of why we move

01:09:02.260 --> 01:09:04.020
to the next one that we do move to.

01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:07.580
By contrast, while the result is graphed,

01:09:07.580 --> 01:09:10.820
as it is in its truth, as determinate negation,

01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:13.460
a new form has thereby immediately arisen.

01:09:13.460 --> 01:09:16.340
And in the negation, the transition is made

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:19.140
whereby the progression through the complete series

01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:22.300
of shapes comes about on its own accord.

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.540
So to say that a shape of consciousness

01:09:24.540 --> 01:09:28.140
is a determinate negation is to say that it isn't something,

01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.460
but it's not nothing in general.

01:09:30.460 --> 01:09:31.740
It's not just nothing.

01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:33.620
There's a specific thing it isn't,

01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.900
namely the previous shape of consciousness.

01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:38.420
In particular, it's a shape of consciousness

01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:42.340
that arises in a principled way out of the failure

01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:44.180
of the previous shape of consciousness.

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:46.460
And Hegel is now going to give us an account

01:09:46.460 --> 01:09:49.700
of exactly what that function is

01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:52.060
that gets you from one shape of consciousness

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:53.620
that fails to the next.

01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:56.660
But again, rather than doing that,

01:09:56.660 --> 01:10:00.220
he then skips to the next topic, which is where it ends.

01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:04.540
So what we need is an account of where we start,

01:10:04.540 --> 01:10:06.140
how we move, and where we end.

01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:07.700
We've seen a little about where we start,

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.620
a little about how we move,

01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:12.060
and now Hegel's gonna tell us more about how we end.

01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:17.060
However, to knowing the goal is necessarily fixed

01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:19.500
as the series of the progression

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:22.020
is as necessarily fixed as the series of the progression,

01:10:22.020 --> 01:10:23.620
although you haven't really told us exactly

01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:25.380
what the series of the progression is, Hegel.

01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:26.420
The goal is the point.

01:10:26.420 --> 01:10:28.780
The goal is the point at which knowing

01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:32.340
no longer needs to go beyond its own self.

01:10:32.340 --> 01:10:35.540
Where knowing itself finds itself,

01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:38.500
and where the concept corresponds to the object,

01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:40.780
and the object to the concept.

01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:43.100
The progression towards this goal

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.460
is thus also unrelenting,

01:10:45.460 --> 01:10:50.460
and at no earlier stage dissatisfaction to be felt.

01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:54.420
So this process will end

01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:57.700
when there's so little distinction

01:10:57.700 --> 01:10:59.820
between subject and object,

01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:02.820
between knowing and the object of knowing,

01:11:02.820 --> 01:11:06.580
that no skepticism about that shape of consciousness

01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:07.420
is possible.

01:11:08.420 --> 01:11:12.140
So it's going to end only with such a complete coincidence

01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:14.180
of knowing at its object

01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:16.540
that the skeptical problem

01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:21.540
about these conceptions of knowledge cannot arise.

01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:24.460
Now what exactly that is,

01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:27.460
is only described at the end of the book.

01:11:27.460 --> 01:11:29.700
It's very, very hard to understand.

01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:31.900
But that's where we're supposed to go.

01:11:31.900 --> 01:11:35.700
Okay, now why can consciousness not stop

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:37.860
anywhere short of the entity?

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.180
Consciousness therefore suffers this violence

01:11:40.180 --> 01:11:41.780
at its own hands,

01:11:41.780 --> 01:11:45.820
and brings to ruin its own restricted satisfaction.

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:49.460
So the failure of these forms of consciousness,

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:50.500
these shapes of consciousness,

01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:51.980
these conceptions of knowledge,

01:11:51.980 --> 01:11:53.540
is not something external.

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:57.180
Consciousness itself realizes

01:11:57.180 --> 01:11:59.420
that its conception of knowledge is wrong.

01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:00.860
It does it to itself.

01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:03.860
With the feeling of this violence,

01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:07.020
anxiety over the truth might well withdraw

01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:10.540
and strive to hold onto what it is in danger of losing.

01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:13.260
But this anxiety can find no rest.

01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:16.260
Even if it wants to remain in thoughtless indolence,

01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:18.780
thought spoils the thoughtlessness,

01:12:18.820 --> 01:12:21.740
and its unrest disturbs the indolence.

01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:24.860
So as Hegel says on the next page,

01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.140
where can I never find this?

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:40.300
I know I have this underlined.

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:42.420
Okay, as he says in the next couple of pages,

01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:43.620
which we will come to,

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:48.620
it is an issue for consciousness

01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.980
whether or not its knowing of the object

01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.860
corresponds to the object, that's 56.

01:12:53.860 --> 01:12:56.540
So consciousness, it cannot be indifferent

01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:59.220
to consciousness whether it knows.

01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:03.940
So consciousness purports to no objects.

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:07.220
It has a conception of what knowledge is.

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:12.220
And Hegel says it is not indifferent to consciousness.

01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:15.060
Consciousness can't just not care

01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:18.340
about whether what it thinks knowing is, is knowing.

01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:23.940
Now, you might think, well,

01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:27.180
knowledge is just one thing in life.

01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:29.100
Like I have a lot of family members

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.860
who don't care that much about what knowledge is.

01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:35.500
They do, only philosophers are so,

01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:39.900
only a philosopher could say consciousness

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:41.260
with feeling of this violence,

01:13:41.260 --> 01:13:43.340
anxiety over the truth might well withdraw

01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:45.260
and strive to hold on to what is in danger of losing.

01:13:45.260 --> 01:13:47.220
This anxiety can find no rest.

01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:48.980
Even if it wants to remain in thoughtless indolence,

01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:50.420
thought spoils the thoughtlessness

01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:52.820
that its unrest disturbs the indolence.

01:13:52.820 --> 01:13:56.780
A lot of people, their anxiety does find a rest.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:59.780
They don't, they wanna remain in thoughtless indolence

01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:02.860
and thought doesn't spoil their thoughtlessness

01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:05.060
and unrest does not disturb their indolence.

01:14:05.060 --> 01:14:07.940
They're very happy to not think or not know.

01:14:07.940 --> 01:14:12.300
So this is not supposed to be a psychological claim

01:14:12.300 --> 01:14:15.020
about particular conscious subjects.

01:14:15.020 --> 01:14:17.620
So whatever Hegel's claim is here,

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:20.740
is not supposed to be contrary to

01:14:20.740 --> 01:14:22.980
and therefore not refutable to psychological claims

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:24.500
about particular human beings.

01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:28.180
As we'll see over the course of the phenomenology

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:29.940
or if we were to read the whole phenomenology

01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:31.860
as we would see, knowledge,

01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:35.140
Hegel thinks of as a very, very general phenomenon.

01:14:35.140 --> 01:14:37.860
It's sort of ubiquitous or structural

01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:39.500
in human life.

01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:44.100
So doing something, action is also a kind of knowledge.

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:47.740
It's a representation of the object

01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:50.460
as being in conformity with your representation of it,

01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:51.700
as being choice worthy.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.820
So there's no way of being indifferent to knowledge.

01:14:55.820 --> 01:15:00.820
Any acting, any willing, any belief about the world

01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:06.820
is making a claim to knowledge.

01:15:06.820 --> 01:15:10.500
So notice I haven't said that knowledge here

01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.380
is this thing that analytic philosophers

01:15:12.380 --> 01:15:14.620
are kind of pointlessly obsessed with.

01:15:14.620 --> 01:15:15.660
S knows that P.

01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:25.460
This is a much more general structure.

01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:28.340
This is the structure of your relationship with the world.

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.060
This you might not care about.

01:15:31.060 --> 01:15:32.460
You probably shouldn't care about it.

01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:34.340
Stop caring about it.

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:38.700
This you walk around life

01:15:38.700 --> 01:15:41.220
carrying with you a conception of this.

01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:43.340
It cannot be indifferent to you

01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.660
whether the world does actually relate to you

01:15:45.660 --> 01:15:48.340
the way you conceive it as related to you.

01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:51.940
Okay, a little bit further and then we'll take a break.

01:15:51.940 --> 01:15:55.180
Just as these preliminary and general remarks

01:15:55.180 --> 01:15:57.700
about the manner and the necessity of the progression

01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:02.060
have been made, so too it might be useful to recall something

01:16:02.060 --> 01:16:04.740
about the method of the way it is carried out.

01:16:04.740 --> 01:16:07.380
So Hegel is now gonna tell us more about

01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:10.140
how consciousness undermines

01:16:10.140 --> 01:16:15.140
its own conception of knowledge or the law of the series.

01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:17.900
Sorry, not the law of the series.

01:16:17.900 --> 01:16:19.740
The law of the series is how we go from

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:21.660
shape of consciousness and the shape of consciousness

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.740
and plus one, but why we have to move on.

01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:26.980
Why one shape of consciousness fails.

01:16:28.380 --> 01:16:30.380
Just as these preliminary and general remarks

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:31.500
about the manner and the necessity

01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:32.740
of the progression have been made,

01:16:32.740 --> 01:16:34.220
so too it might be useful to recall something

01:16:34.220 --> 01:16:35.900
about the method of the way it is carried out.

01:16:35.900 --> 01:16:39.340
This exposition represented as the conduct of science

01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:41.700
in relation to knowing as it appears

01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:44.220
and represented as the investigation and testing

01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:47.140
of the reality of cognition seems incapable

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:50.140
of taking place without some kind of presupposition

01:16:50.140 --> 01:16:52.780
with underlies it as a stem.

01:16:52.780 --> 01:16:56.420
So it looks like, once again, it appears.

01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:59.500
That means he's suggesting this is something you might think

01:16:59.540 --> 01:17:00.980
he's ultimately gonna undermine it.

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:02.500
You might think that what we need to do

01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:04.820
is have a standard of what knowing is

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.780
and then investigate each shape of consciousness

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:08.700
and say, that doesn't meet the standard.

01:17:08.700 --> 01:17:10.500
That's not what knowing is.

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:13.220
For the testing consists in the application

01:17:13.220 --> 01:17:17.140
of an accepted standard and in the resulting equality

01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:22.020
or inequality between the standard and what is tested

01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:25.220
lays the decision as to what is tested

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.540
is correct or incorrect.

01:17:27.540 --> 01:17:30.500
The standard, likewise, science itself,

01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:32.660
if science were to be the standard,

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:35.220
is thereby accepted as the essence or as the in itself.

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:37.860
Ignore, we'll come back to essence and in itself.

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:39.340
But here, at the point where science

01:17:39.340 --> 01:17:40.900
first comes on the scene,

01:17:40.900 --> 01:17:43.540
where someone makes a claim to scientific knowledge,

01:17:43.540 --> 01:17:45.620
neither science itself nor anything else

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:48.980
has justified itself as the essence or as the in itself.

01:17:48.980 --> 01:17:51.340
And without something like that taking place,

01:17:51.340 --> 01:17:54.940
it seems that no examination could take place at all.

01:17:56.020 --> 01:17:57.360
So there's this problem.

01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:00.000
It looks like we need to apply a standard.

01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.840
Where does the standard come from?

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:04.240
One can have a more determinant grasp of this contradiction

01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:06.000
and the removal of the contradiction.

01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:07.280
If, first of all, one is reminded

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.800
of the abstract determinations of knowing and truth

01:18:09.800 --> 01:18:12.840
as they come before consciousness.

01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:16.600
Okay, so what Hegel is doing in 81

01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:20.280
is he's making a reference

01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.040
to something called the dilemma of the criterion.

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:26.200
I'm going to erase Hegel's system.

01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:29.960
It's actually very Hegelian.

01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:34.120
When we get into Hegel's logic,

01:18:34.120 --> 01:18:35.840
there's going to be a lot of erasure.

01:18:35.840 --> 01:18:38.000
That's going to be like a main metaphor.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:41.560
Hegel's a great philosopher to teach on the blackboard.

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:42.400
Okay.

01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:46.520
The dilemma of the criterion

01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:53.040
comes from a work of ancient philosophy

01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:55.040
by Sextus empiricus.

01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.920
Called outlines of purism.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.280
Here's the basic idea.

01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:12.000
Or this is how Hegel is thinking of the idea in Sextus.

01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:13.840
That's what matters for our purposes.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:17.880
Someone makes a claim to knowledge.

01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:20.100
We have to have a standard

01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:22.480
for whether that counts as knowledge or not.

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.760
Whether that's a valid knowledge group.

01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:26.440
Whether that person in fact knows what they claim to know.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:29.160
Now either that standard

01:19:29.160 --> 01:19:31.920
is that person's own conception of knowledge.

01:19:32.780 --> 01:19:34.080
In which case it's circular.

01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:36.640
Very easy.

01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:38.440
Now, totally useless.

01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:41.280
Everyone's conception of knowledge agrees with itself,

01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:44.160
so everyone meets their own standard.

01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:47.040
Or the standard has to be external

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:48.140
to their conception of knowledge.

01:19:48.140 --> 01:19:49.640
But then it's question-making.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.520
So, what Hegel is doing

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.640
is raising this as a problem for his own project.

01:19:58.000 --> 01:19:59.120
What we don't want to do

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:02.560
is apply external standards or criterions.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.400
Criteria.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:09.280
We'll also call it the dilemma of the standard.

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.120
Maschab.

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:17.040
So, what he's going to do is develop a way

01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:19.680
of how consciousness can undermine

01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:21.440
its own conception of knowledge

01:20:21.480 --> 01:20:24.120
that doesn't run into the dilemma of the criteria.

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:30.360
One can have a more determinate grasp of this contradiction

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:32.400
and the removal of the contradiction

01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.640
if first of all, one is reminded

01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.600
of the abstract determinations of knowing their truth

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:39.520
as they come before consciousness.

01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:42.040
Okay, abstract determinations means

01:20:42.040 --> 01:20:44.000
these are sort of,

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.080
Hegel's now going to give us a very abstract model

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.300
of what consciousness acknowledges.

01:20:49.300 --> 01:20:51.620
Now, if we were reading the whole phenomenology,

01:20:51.620 --> 01:20:53.780
one question would be whether this model

01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:56.260
in the introduction actually applies to the whole book.

01:20:56.260 --> 01:20:57.940
I don't think it does,

01:20:57.940 --> 01:21:00.300
but I think it's fine for our purposes

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.660
because it applies to the parts of the book

01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:02.820
that we're going to read.

01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:06.940
So, consciousness distinguishes something from itself

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:09.660
while at the same time it relates itself to it.

01:21:09.660 --> 01:21:14.140
Okay, so I'm going to remove the term subject and object

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:17.360
because those are not yet Hegel's terms.

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:23.540
So we have consciousness.

01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:30.980
It has a relation to something distinct from itself

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:34.580
and it also distinguishes itself from it.

01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:36.500
Or, as it is expressed,

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:39.660
the something is something for consciousness.

01:21:43.540 --> 01:21:46.940
This is for consciousness.

01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:49.860
Something consciousness is of.

01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:53.380
This something is something for consciousness

01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:55.900
and the determinate aspect of this relating

01:21:55.900 --> 01:21:59.040
or of the being of something for a consciousness is known.

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:05.300
So knowing is a relation of consciousness to the object.

01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.620
In this direction, this object is for consciousness.

01:22:09.620 --> 01:22:12.820
In this direction, consciousness knows this object.

01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:15.740
However, we distinguish the being for another

01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:17.380
from being in itself.

01:22:26.860 --> 01:22:28.820
That which is related to knowing

01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:31.180
is just as much distinguished from knowing

01:22:31.180 --> 01:22:35.340
and is positive as being also external to this relation.

01:22:35.340 --> 01:22:40.100
The aspect of this in itself is called truth.

01:22:40.100 --> 01:22:43.280
So the aspect of being in itself

01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:48.280
that it can be if outstanding in this relationship is truth.

01:22:48.480 --> 01:22:49.320
Now what does that mean?

01:22:49.320 --> 01:22:52.640
What it means is this is a super abstract structural

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:55.000
description of consciousness and knowledge.

01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:58.580
Consciousness distinguishes itself from something,

01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:00.240
the object of consciousness,

01:23:00.240 --> 01:23:03.240
but also relates itself to knowing.

01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:04.320
And remember, knowing here

01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.400
is not necessarily propositional knowledge.

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.400
Don't worry about that.

01:23:07.400 --> 01:23:10.080
It could be acquaintance, perceiving something.

01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:13.080
That's a kind of note, willing something.

01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:17.060
But what it knows has some kind of independence

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:18.920
of its relationship to it.

01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.040
That is to say that being,

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:25.600
what it knows is not identical to its knowledge.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.120
Now that doesn't mean

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:30.320
that this thing is completely independent of this.

01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:35.160
It means that it isn't simply identical to this.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.020
It means that if we got rid of this entirely,

01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:40.600
we would have a completely different model.

01:23:40.600 --> 01:23:42.960
Okay, that's all Hegel is assuming.

01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:45.540
Now, Rota's truth here does not mean P.

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:53.280
analytic philosophy is very into P's and Q's and R's.

01:23:53.280 --> 01:23:56.060
It is, as I like to call it, philosophy in the key of P.

01:23:57.840 --> 01:24:00.520
Hegel is not a philosopher in the key of P.

01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:03.600
As we'll see over the course of this semester,

01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:06.640
I think it's actually super crucial to understanding Hegel

01:24:06.640 --> 01:24:09.440
that Hegel cannot be put in the form of P.

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.480
There is no P, there's no value of P,

01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:13.480
especially Hegel's view is P.

01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:14.880
Yes.

01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:17.640
Knowing determines consciousness

01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:21.080
or consciousness determines knowing.

01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:23.600
Consciousness, for now we're assuming

01:24:23.600 --> 01:24:26.020
that knowing is the relationship

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:28.080
of consciousness to the object.

01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:31.240
Knowing is a relation that consciousness has to the object.

01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:33.960
We only call something consciousness right now

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.200
insofar as it stands in a knowing relation

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:38.800
to the object, to the in itself.

01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:43.640
Okay, skip a paragraph, but the nature of the object

01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:47.960
which we are investigating goes beyond this division

01:24:47.960 --> 01:24:51.640
or to this semblance of division and presupposition.

01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:54.320
So it looks like we have a distinction

01:24:54.320 --> 01:24:58.600
between consciousness and our conception of consciousness.

01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:02.240
This thing on the blackboard is a conception of consciousness.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.800
But the nature of this object is that distinction

01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.880
between this and the whole thing is overcome.

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:20.800
Consciousness in its own self provides its own standard

01:25:20.800 --> 01:25:24.320
and the investigation will therefore be a comparison

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:28.520
of itself, of it with itself, for the difference

01:25:28.520 --> 01:25:33.000
which has just been made falls within consciousness.

01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:36.320
That is to say, consciousness itself

01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:38.880
has a conception of this.

01:25:44.820 --> 01:25:48.280
So this difference between consciousness

01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.640
and being in itself falls within consciousness

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:54.360
because consciousness is consciousness.

01:25:54.360 --> 01:25:56.380
We can also know if I was a better drawer,

01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:59.320
I could have put this thought bubble inside consciousness.

01:25:59.320 --> 01:26:00.520
Hard to draw with chalk.

01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:06.200
Consciousness is its own self, provides its own standard.

01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:08.560
So consciousness brings with it a standard

01:26:08.560 --> 01:26:09.720
of what knowledge is.

01:26:11.800 --> 01:26:15.160
Therefore, skipping again a few sentences,

01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.120
therefore in what consciousness declares within itself

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:23.120
to be the in itself or the true, we have the standard

01:26:23.120 --> 01:26:26.920
which consciousness itself sets up to measure its known.

01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:31.060
So consciousness has a standard, it has to know this.

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:33.400
That sets a standard.

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:37.600
If we designate knowing as the concept,

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:42.140
but designate the essence or the true over here

01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:45.900
as what is or the object, then the examining consists

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:48.860
in whether the concept corresponds to the object.

01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:52.840
Does this correspond to that?

01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:56.500
Is this a way of knowingly relating to that?

01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:59.920
Well remember, what relation knowing is also,

01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.680
it's up to consciousness to say.

01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:03.560
So don't assume that it's true justified belief

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:04.600
or whatever.

01:27:04.600 --> 01:27:06.160
Let me just go a little bit further.

01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:08.540
Oh, 84.

01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:11.560
End of 84.

01:27:16.120 --> 01:27:19.640
What is essential throughout the whole investigation

01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:22.440
is to hold fast to this, that both of these moments,

01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.720
concept and object, being for another,

01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:27.800
being for consciousness and being in itself,

01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:31.320
themselves fall within the knowing that we are investigating.

01:27:31.360 --> 01:27:33.400
They fall within consciousness.

01:27:33.400 --> 01:27:35.280
They fall within consciousness's conception

01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:36.760
of itself as known.

01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:39.960
And that we thus do not need to bring standards with us

01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:43.220
and in the investigation to apply our ideas and thoughts.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.120
But now you might think, okay,

01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:47.660
isn't Hegel running into one horn

01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:49.480
of the dilemma of the criterion?

01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.780
Every conception of knowing is just going to agree

01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:53.580
with its own standard.

01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:55.680
No, Hegel's about target.

01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.920
That actually shapes of consciousness in general

01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.120
do not agree with their own standard.

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:02.200
However, from this aspect,

01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:05.620
not only will it be superfluous for us to add anything,

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:07.460
and not only because concept and object,

01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:08.920
the standard and what is to be examined

01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:11.580
are present in consciousness itself,

01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:16.580
the only thing that remains is for us to purely look on.

01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:19.360
So now this is a super important aspect

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.000
of the way Hegel does philosophy.

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:22.440
And this is the first instance of it

01:28:22.440 --> 01:28:24.360
that we've seen in the phenomenology.

01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:27.780
Hegel's philosophy is supposed to always be imminent.

01:28:28.780 --> 01:28:33.780
That means there's some subject matter

01:28:35.520 --> 01:28:38.620
and the further development of the claims

01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:41.300
about that subject matter in Hegel's philosophy

01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:43.540
arise from the subject matter itself.

01:28:44.740 --> 01:28:48.160
That means at no point in the phenomenology

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:52.000
can Hegel say, look, it's plausible that this,

01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:55.320
or I think that, or in my view this,

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:58.520
everything has to come out of consciousness itself.

01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.080
And since the beginning of the phenomenology

01:29:00.080 --> 01:29:01.280
is natural consciousness,

01:29:01.280 --> 01:29:03.720
it has to arise from natural consciousness itself.

01:29:03.720 --> 01:29:05.400
So what we do in the phenomenology

01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:08.440
is we just observe natural consciousness

01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:12.180
developing itself through these shapes of consciousness

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.480
to absolute knowing.

01:29:15.560 --> 01:29:19.880
It is consciousness of what to it is the true.

01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.960
So it's consciousness of this

01:29:21.960 --> 01:29:26.220
as well as consciousness of its knowing of the truth.

01:29:26.220 --> 01:29:28.540
So it's conscious not only of this,

01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:30.360
but of this whole thing.

01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:32.140
So it's object consciousness,

01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:35.720
but also consciousness of itself as knowing

01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:38.320
under a particular description of what knowing is.

01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:41.880
It is an issue for that consciousness

01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.760
whether or not it's knowing of the object

01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.760
corresponds to the object.

01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:48.160
So consciousness cannot be indifferent

01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.420
to whether this agrees with that.

01:29:51.420 --> 01:29:53.940
Because it itself has supplied the criteria.

01:29:55.540 --> 01:30:00.100
Okay, so we're gonna somehow argue

01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:02.820
that various shapes of consciousness

01:30:02.820 --> 01:30:05.020
fail their own criteria.

01:30:05.020 --> 01:30:08.460
That they think this is a knowing of that,

01:30:08.460 --> 01:30:10.700
but this as they themselves conceive it

01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:12.820
is not a knowing of that.

01:30:12.820 --> 01:30:15.740
Okay, we'll take one a little bit

01:30:15.740 --> 01:30:16.840
and then we'll take a break

01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.940
and then we'll read the last three paragraphs

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:19.780
really carefully.

01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:23.380
This dialectical movement.

01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:25.900
Ah, okay, so you've been wondering,

01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:26.860
you're taking a Hegel class

01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:28.100
and he's been doing it for two hours.

01:30:28.100 --> 01:30:29.500
He hasn't said the word dialectic yet.

01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:30.340
Okay.

01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:33.540
Dialectic.

01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:38.700
Hegel.

01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:45.940
In some sense, all of Hegel's philosophy

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:48.460
works by something called the dialectic

01:30:48.460 --> 01:30:50.100
or dialectical progression.

01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:53.540
I think the structure of the dialectic

01:30:53.540 --> 01:30:55.860
in phenomenology is different

01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:58.980
than the structure of the dialectic in the larger.

01:30:58.980 --> 01:31:00.760
I don't understand the dialectic

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:01.740
of the philosophy of nature

01:31:01.740 --> 01:31:03.220
or really the philosophy of spirit either,

01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:04.140
but I really don't understand

01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:05.420
the dialectic philosophy of nature.

01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:07.620
No one really understands the dialectic philosophy of nature.

01:31:07.620 --> 01:31:10.340
But what does Hegel mean by the word dialectic?

01:31:11.860 --> 01:31:14.260
There's two historical sources that are relevant.

01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:16.980
One, in ancient philosophy,

01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:19.740
dialectic, very simply put,

01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:23.480
is the science of refuting what other people say.

01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:26.740
So it's a negative logical art

01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:27.900
where you say something

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:29.460
and I reduce you to absurdity.

01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:35.500
In Kant, there's something called the transcendental dialect.

01:31:37.180 --> 01:31:40.260
Now the transcendental dialectic actually has three parts,

01:31:40.260 --> 01:31:44.380
but Hegel always associates the dialectic with the antinomies.

01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:47.860
The idea of the antinomies of pure reason

01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:51.740
in the first critique is that reason itself

01:31:51.740 --> 01:31:53.580
is subject to a dialectic.

01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:57.020
So it's not that someone comes along and refutes reason,

01:31:57.020 --> 01:31:59.180
reason refutes itself.

01:31:59.180 --> 01:32:03.560
It refutes itself and so far as it assumes

01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:06.460
that objects in space and time are things in themselves

01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:09.860
because it forms this conception

01:32:09.860 --> 01:32:12.300
of something called the unconditioned.

01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:14.860
So you take something, you take its conditions

01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:17.900
and then you take the complete sequence of its conditions.

01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:22.660
And it has a proof that that sequence of conditions

01:32:22.660 --> 01:32:25.300
terminates in an unconditioned first condition

01:32:25.300 --> 01:32:27.640
and it has a proof that it cannot terminate,

01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.020
that it goes on infinitely.

01:32:29.020 --> 01:32:30.340
That's a contradiction.

01:32:30.340 --> 01:32:33.020
And so the resolution to that contradiction, Kant thinks,

01:32:33.020 --> 01:32:34.780
is to recognize that objects in space and time

01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:37.220
are appearances and so there is no such thing

01:32:37.220 --> 01:32:39.740
as the unconditioned totality of their conditions.

01:32:39.740 --> 01:32:40.940
If you haven't taken 3.14,

01:32:40.940 --> 01:32:42.980
that wouldn't really make a lot of sense to you,

01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:44.580
but you should all just take 3.14.

01:32:44.580 --> 01:32:46.840
Okay, who's taking 3.14?

01:32:48.100 --> 01:32:49.780
Good, the rest of you should model yourselves

01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:51.300
on those who are taking 3.14.

01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:56.540
So what Hegel means by a dialectic

01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:59.000
is as in ancient philosophy,

01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:04.880
refutation is a negative, it's negative.

01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:10.260
But as with Kant, it's not refutation by some other person.

01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:15.220
It's not external refutation, it's self-refutation.

01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:18.140
It's the self-refutation here in the phenomenology

01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:19.940
of shapes of consciousness,

01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:22.380
of conceptions of what knowledge is.

01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:27.340
The difference between both ancient dialectic,

01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:29.580
Kantian dialectic and Hegelian dialectic

01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:33.020
is as we saw earlier, Hegel thinks that dialectic

01:33:33.020 --> 01:33:35.180
is not purely negative.

01:33:35.180 --> 01:33:37.500
It's productive or positive.

01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:39.820
So when we dialectically undermine

01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:41.260
the shape of consciousness,

01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:44.460
we don't go, oh fuck, we have a contradiction.

01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:47.180
That generates positive content.

01:33:48.580 --> 01:33:50.940
What Hegel calls the determinant negation

01:33:50.940 --> 01:33:52.500
of the refuted shape of consciousness,

01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:55.660
which is the successor shape of consciousness,

01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:59.540
which in a principled fashion, non-orbitarily,

01:33:59.540 --> 01:34:02.360
attempts to resolve the contradiction

01:34:02.360 --> 01:34:04.620
in the earlier shape of consciousness.

01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:05.660
So no, that's why.

01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:08.620
So that means the phenomenology of spirit

01:34:08.620 --> 01:34:11.520
is the inner dialectic of knowing.

01:34:11.520 --> 01:34:14.660
But it's not just refutation, it's also position.

01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:16.120
It's also positive.

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:18.660
The self-refutation of one shape of consciousness

01:34:18.660 --> 01:34:21.180
generates the next shape of consciousness.

01:34:21.180 --> 01:34:23.500
And that's why it's important

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:26.260
that Hegel give us a principled function

01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:28.140
from shape of consciousness n

01:34:28.140 --> 01:34:30.340
to shape of consciousness n plus one.

01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:33.020
Because otherwise, the imminence

01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:36.460
of the phenomenology of spirit would be wrecked.

01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:39.460
That is to say, we would have to supply it.

01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:40.980
We'd be like, what's a reasonable

01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:42.220
next shape of consciousness?

01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:44.180
Well, this seems good.

01:34:44.180 --> 01:34:47.940
And it would no longer be consciousness developing itself.

01:34:47.940 --> 01:34:50.860
And so in a certain way, it would fall a foul

01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:52.980
of the problem of the criterion.

01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:56.060
Something external to consciousness

01:34:56.060 --> 01:34:59.060
would be telling it what its next standard should be.

01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:01.420
And consciousness would not be rationally obliged

01:35:01.420 --> 01:35:02.260
to accept that.

01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:08.220
So we require an in-principle account

01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:11.220
of how one shape of consciousness

01:35:11.220 --> 01:35:14.260
gives rise to the next shape of consciousness.

01:35:14.260 --> 01:35:19.260
Okay, why don't we take a 10-minute break

01:35:20.620 --> 01:35:22.940
and come back at 54 past?

01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:24.900
If you are auditing this class

01:35:24.900 --> 01:35:27.620
and you have not yet been added to Quirkus,

01:35:27.620 --> 01:35:28.860
please come speak to me

01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:31.100
and I will add you to Quirkus right now.

01:35:37.780 --> 01:35:38.620
Hello.

01:35:38.620 --> 01:35:39.460
Can I add it?

01:35:39.460 --> 01:35:40.620
Yes, you just.

01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:45.980
It makes me so warm.

01:35:45.980 --> 01:35:46.820
Dial in.
