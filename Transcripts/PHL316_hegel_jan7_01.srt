1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
So let me say a few things about the idea of this class.

2
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:11,040
So Hegel has always suffered from the problem

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,280
that he is very hard to teach.

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,640
And the reason he is very hard to teach

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,920
is because there is no book by Hegel

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,120
that is the equivalent of the critique of pure reason,

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,120
or the ethics of Spinoza, or the Republic of Plato,

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,800
or Truth is a Human Nature.

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,560
That is to say, a single book that you

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,920
could teach either in the course of a semester,

11
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,000
or you could teach a significant chunk of a semester,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,120
that gives you, if not the philosopher's whole system,

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,960
at least enough of it that you can kind of figure out

14
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,480
how everything fits into it.

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,200
The closest thing in Hegel would be the philosophy of right.

16
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,640
But that is really only a very small part of Hegel's system.

17
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,040
The books by Hegel that do contain a more complete

18
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,640
presentation of the system have this problem

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,520
that they are unbelievably hard to read,

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,240
in particular this one, the Phenomenology of Spirit.

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,560
So the standard way that Hegel gets

22
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,760
taught at the undergraduate class

23
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,960
is you teach the Phenomenology of Spirit.

24
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,080
So in the past when I've taught this class,

25
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,200
I have done the standard thing.

26
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,320
You try to read the Phenomenology of Spirit.

27
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,960
The problem with that is that in one semester,

28
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,480
you can only really do half of the Phenomenology.

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,640
I never managed to get to the end.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,000
And the Phenomenology of Spirit is, I think,

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,960
the hardest book in the entire Western philosophical tradition.

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,880
So what has this experience teaching the Phenomenology

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,360
of Spirit that, at a certain point, people aren't really

34
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,920
reading the book anymore.

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,280
They're just kind of getting a kind of indirect high level

36
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,720
summary of it.

37
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,960
And they're kind of talking about Hegel,

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,480
but they're not really talking about what's in the book.

39
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,960
And that's not just true of students

40
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,160
in undergraduate classes.

41
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,520
On Hegel, I sometimes have the impression

42
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,120
with a lot of so-called Hegel scholars

43
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,840
that they're not really reading the same book that I am.

44
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,000
They're kind of like doing this second hand high level

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,880
summary of Hegel.

46
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:22,280
So the last time I taught 316, I went the opposite direction.

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,840
We read the Phenomenology of Spirit line by line.

48
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,400
In fact, in at least one three hour course,

49
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,960
we didn't get past a single sentence.

50
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,520
That had the contrary benefit that people were really, really

51
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,800
reading the text.

52
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,160
However, it had the complementary problem

53
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,120
that we didn't get very far.

54
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,520
And after a certain point, even if you're

55
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,280
reading it sentence by sentence, Hegel

56
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,680
is extraordinarily difficult.

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,320
So this class is going to go in the opposite direction.

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:59,280
The idea of this class is that we're going to do,

59
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,440
or I'm going to present, the entirety of Hegel's system,

60
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,640
or at least not the whole thing.

61
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,400
You can't do the whole thing one semester.

62
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,680
I'm going to talk about all of the main structural moments

63
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,920
of Hegel's system.

64
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,880
And I'll talk about this in more detail, a little bit more

65
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,040
detail later today, and much more detail in several weeks.

66
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,600
We're going to talk about the Phenomenology of Spirit, which

67
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:27,280
is the introduction to the system, which has three parts,

68
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,760
logic, philosophy of spirit.

69
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,440
Sorry, I really should bring my notes with me.

70
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:42,760
Philosophy of nature, that's an embarrassing mistake.

71
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,920
The philosophy of spirit.

72
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,640
So we're obviously not going to read every part.

73
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,040
The book that presents this whole thing is called the Psychopedia.

74
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,800
We're not going to read the entire Encyclopedia.

75
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,240
That would be ridiculous.

76
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,040
But we're going to talk about all of the main structural moments

77
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,920
of this.

78
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,560
So we're going to spend the first two weeks on the Phenomenology

79
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,640
of Spirit.

80
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,680
We're going to spend three, four, five, six, from weeks three

81
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,840
to six on the logic, which means we're

82
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,800
going to talk about the beginning.

83
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,360
And we're going to talk about the end.

84
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,840
And then we're going to spend a week on the transition

85
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,440
to the philosophy of nature.

86
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,400
Then we're going to spend a week talking

87
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,480
about the move from the philosophy of nature

88
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,080
to the philosophy of spirit.

89
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,160
And then we're going to spend one week on the philosophy of right.

90
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,800
It's week nine.

91
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,640
We're going to spend, I feel like I've missed a week somewhere

92
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,140
in here.

93
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:43,560
This is not quite accurate.

94
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,960
But you get the basic picture.

95
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:55,400
And then we're going to spend one week on art, one week on religion,

96
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,400
and then one week on philosophy, which

97
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,600
is the return of the philosophy of spirit back to the logic.

98
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,720
So we're not going to cover every single part of the system.

99
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,600
But we are going to talk about all the major moving parts.

100
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,560
So the other idea that sort of mixed in with this idea for this course

101
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,360
is we're going to read all the parts of Hegel you can just read.

102
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,800
We're going to read all the easy parts of it.

103
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,760
And we're going to read them in systematic order

104
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:26,360
so that you have some idea of what Hegel's philosophical system actually

105
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:26,960
is.

106
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,120
The other problem with reading the phenomenology of spirit,

107
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,200
the other problem with treating the phenomenology of spirit

108
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:37,120
as like the textbook for an undergraduate Hegel course,

109
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,240
is I'll talk about this more later today and more next week.

110
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,840
The phenomenology of spirit is in a certain way,

111
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,400
although this requires qualifications, only Hegel's negative view.

112
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,000
It should bear the subtitle wrong answers only.

113
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,240
So the phenomenology of spirit is a series of failed attempts,

114
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,880
failed accounts of what knowledge is.

115
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,600
So it's just very weird that this book has become treated

116
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:07,440
as the critique of pure reason of Hegel.

117
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,200
That is just, I mean, Hegel would be totally shocked

118
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,160
that this is the book that everyone reads,

119
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:16,720
because it's basically his jubinellia.

120
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,320
And he wasn't even really sure what to do with it

121
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,160
once he had completed the mature system, which is this.

122
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,400
OK.

123
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,960
So that's the idea of what you've gotten yourself into.

124
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,920
OK.

125
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,360
Some course mechanics.

126
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,240
The syllabus is on Quercus.

127
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,800
I will just say a few things about it.

128
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I find discussing course mechanics in the beginning

129
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,720
of the semester really boring.

130
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,280
So I'm going to do this very quickly.

131
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,520
You have to write two essays, and there is a final exam

132
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,480
during the exam period.

133
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:53,080
The, you know, it couldn't be more straightforward.

134
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,280
OK.

135
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,920
Your participation grade will be determined

136
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,160
on the basis of how many weeks you submit questions

137
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,400
about the reading.

138
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,160
So the questions about the reading should be written.

139
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,160
You can type them if you want, but it's also

140
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,720
fine to submit them just handwritten,

141
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,160
as long as your handwriting is legible.

142
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,680
And they should be questions about the reading for that week.

143
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,400
And not, you know, like, I was an undergraduate too once.

144
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,000
I know all the tricks, right?

145
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,640
So not like you just turn to a random page in the reading,

146
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,400
and you find Hegel saying, the study of philosophy

147
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,120
is hindered by the conduct of only clever argumentation.

148
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,160
Why does Hegel say the, you know,

149
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,360
that's not what I'm looking for.

150
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,520
You know, put, like, say a little bit more

151
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,280
about why this question is relevant or contextualize it.

152
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
Given that Hegel says this, and he says this other thing,

153
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,520
how is this compatible?

154
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,400
Why does Hegel think that this transition is unproblematic?

155
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,160
Why is this argument supposed to be good?

156
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,160
How is this consistent?

157
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,960
Something like that.

158
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,920
Two for every week.

159
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,480
OK.

160
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,040
So some of you probably, how many of you

161
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,120
brought reading questions for this week?

162
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
OK, good.

163
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,360
That's great.

164
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
A lot of you joined the class later,

165
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,640
didn't know about this, so I'm going

166
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,200
to treat those as extra credit.

167
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,120
You can hand them, you can give them to me

168
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,440
at the end of the day.

169
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,800
But in general, they're due first thing.

170
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,840
So you know, this is like, don't show up

171
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,240
and think you can scribble a few questions about the reading

172
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,560
and grab total credit for it.

173
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,920
That's not going to work.

174
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,800
OK.

175
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,560
Other than that, how many of you here are auditing this class?

176
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,440
OK.

177
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,840
That's a lot.

178
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,200
That's like an insane number.

179
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,720
OK.

180
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,160
So let me just say, those of you who

181
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,720
are taking this class for credit,

182
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,720
you have something of great value that other people want,

183
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,760
which means you have to earn it.

184
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,760
So do your best work.

185
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,480
Because if you don't do your best work,

186
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,400
I would prefer that you just drop the class

187
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,760
and one of the people who's auditing it take your spot.

188
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,280
Because many of them are very, very motivated.

189
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,560
OK.

190
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,480
Let me say one or two things more.

191
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:56,000
Why is Hegel relevant, or why is Hegel important?

192
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,480
Why should you spend the amount of energy

193
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:03,720
that you're going to have to expend this semester on Hegel?

194
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,960
I mean, the other reason that I've designed this class

195
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,360
is I wanted to finally teach a Hegel class that

196
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,320
wasn't impossibly difficult.

197
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,840
This is supposed to be like moderate level difficulty

198
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,600
Hegel.

199
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,120
OK.

200
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,520
I mean, for the most part, not a sign of a really impossible

201
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,960
hard things in Hegel.

202
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,440
But there's a few weeks where we are

203
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,960
going to read some really hard stuff in Hegel,

204
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,880
and I will kind of hold your hand through those.

205
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,560
OK.

206
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,640
So I regard Hegel as the philosophical equal,

207
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,680
the peer of Plato and Aristotle.

208
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:42,520
I think he's the only modern philosopher other than Kant,

209
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:45,120
who has that kind of status.

210
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,320
In a more generous mood, or if Tariq Dicco were here,

211
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,040
I would include Heidegger.

212
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,440
But, and Hegel has had an enormous influence

213
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,320
on European philosophy, the Western philosophy,

214
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,800
after that.

215
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,800
But always, I think, in a distorted form.

216
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,160
That is to say, the Hegel that was taken up

217
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,560
and was influential in philosophy after that

218
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,440
was always in one way or another distorted version of Hegel.

219
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:18,520
So that, in a certain way, the true Hegel

220
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:21,320
remains to be understood and really

221
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,160
philosophically appreciated.

222
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,320
Which also makes reading Hegel very exciting,

223
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:31,360
because there's more work to be done in understanding Hegel,

224
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,400
not just exegetically, but philosophically,

225
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,600
than there is with any other comparably

226
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,400
important modern philosophy, even Kant, especially Kant.

227
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,880
Kant is, in a certain way, relatively well understood,

228
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,960
vastly better understood than Hegel.

229
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,280
And Hegel has only himself to blame for this.

230
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:54,600
The books are, aside from the philosophy of right,

231
00:10:54,600 --> 00:11:00,120
extraordinarily kind of maddeningly difficult.

232
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,920
Sometimes read as though they are.

233
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,800
So Hegel has a reputation, especially

234
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,400
in the English language tradition,

235
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,800
of just being an author of Gable de Gug of gibberish.

236
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,720
That's not true.

237
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,200
That reflects more on the readers who say that,

238
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,000
or that he's some kind of mystic.

239
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,840
Also, that's just a simple misreading.

240
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:27,480
But the books are forbiddingly difficult and dense.

241
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,440
There are significant chunks.

242
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,040
I mean, I've spent so much time reading these books.

243
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,200
I'm on my second read.

244
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,480
I read the Phonology of Spirit cover to cover

245
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,440
with some friends, and then I immediately

246
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,880
started rereading it from scratch.

247
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,800
And that's my fourth complete read through in my life.

248
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,680
And I'm constantly rereading the Science of Logic.

249
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:51,640
There are chunks of these books that I just

250
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,840
have to throw my hands around.

251
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,520
I don't really know what's going on.

252
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,880
Now, there's a reason, and we'll see this

253
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,480
over the course of the semester.

254
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,960
It's not just that Hegel was a bad writer, which he wasn't.

255
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:08,000
So Hegel has this reputation for being a bad writer.

256
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,720
This is simply false.

257
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,120
When Hegel wants to, he can be eloquent, indeed beautiful.

258
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:16,040
There's actually a philosophical reason

259
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:20,680
for why the books are written as densely as they are.

260
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:24,200
I also think part of the reason why some parts of the books

261
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,160
are as dense as they are is because Hegel had not fully

262
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,960
worked out his theory.

263
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,200
He had not fully worked out his system in all of the detail

264
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,160
that he presents it as having been worked out in.

265
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,040
Failures of presentation are often failures of thought.

266
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,320
And I think to some extent, that's

267
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,760
part of what's going on with Hegel in some places.

268
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,920
And also, I think there are philosophical reasons

269
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,880
for why the books have to be written in this way that

270
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,240
is extremely difficult to read.

271
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,920
But because Hegel has, in my view,

272
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,840
never been received as Hegel, that is to say,

273
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,040
the reception of Hegel has always been the distortion

274
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,760
of Hegel.

275
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,480
That makes Hegel exciting.

276
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:15,000
In a certain way, in other moods,

277
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,640
I would say this more vociferously.

278
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:21,680
In a certain way, the big, unaccomplished task

279
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,720
of philosophy in Western tradition

280
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,360
is fully understanding and grappling with Hegel.

281
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,960
I think that's the thing that hasn't really been done.

282
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,480
And this class can serve as a kind of introduction

283
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,360
to doing that, and maybe an inspiration to you

284
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,560
to do that further.

285
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:41,240
Because one of the ways that I hope this class will function

286
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:47,720
is as a propagutic for you to read more of Hegel

287
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,040
on your own, an entry point in Hegel

288
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,120
so that you can study it more on your own.

289
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,400
OK, there is no textbook for this class.

290
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,760
All of the readings are going to be online

291
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,200
on corkis in the form of PDFs, which

292
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:08,640
means that if you want to, you can read them on screens.

293
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:11,200
And that means that I will have to allow laptops

294
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,560
in this class if normally I don't, which I hate doing.

295
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,560
The reason I hate doing that is because these things are just

296
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:20,920
distraction machines.

297
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:23,400
So whenever you see a screen, what you should see

298
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:27,760
is a conspiracy by very rich and powerful people

299
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,360
to destroy your mind and ruin your life,

300
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:33,080
because that's, in fact, what they are.

301
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:37,520
They are the great toxin of our contemporary world.

302
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:40,280
And so I would prefer to not have them in the classroom.

303
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,680
Somehow, all of the best philosophy ever written

304
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,560
was written without them, so we don't actually

305
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,240
need them for any of this.

306
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,400
In fact, all of the best philosophy

307
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,200
was done and taught without artificial light.

308
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,960
So I would really like to someday teach a class.

309
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,080
If you go to old German universities,

310
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,720
if you go to what is now Pumboldo Investitatie

311
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,120
in Berlin, the University of Berlin,

312
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,080
where Hegel is a professor, the Bruins

313
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,040
have these gigantic floor-to-ceiling windows,

314
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,280
because of course, there was no artificial light.

315
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:18,560
And teaching by candlelight is not really a safe or

316
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,960
particularly practical.

317
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,440
So in fact, we don't even need this horrible fluorescent

318
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,240
or a headlighting that's ugly and destroys,

319
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,080
diminishes the human spirit.

320
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:33,800
But unfortunately, we are stuck with this institutional setup.

321
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:37,200
So that was all a way of saying, I encourage you

322
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:44,800
to print out the reading and read Hegel in print,

323
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,480
because all of the evidence is that you understand

324
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,640
and remember things better when you read them in print.

325
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,920
When you read something on paper,

326
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,040
you have this multimodal sensory experience of it.

327
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,480
It's both tactile.

328
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:07,000
If it's a pretty old book, it has an olfactory dimension.

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,240
You shouldn't taste the books.

330
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,080
You have a gustatory dimension.

331
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,040
But there's all the physical, it's carrying it around.

332
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,960
You develop a physical relationship with your book.

333
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,600
So if you've ever taken a class under critique of pure reason,

334
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:23,040
by the end of the semester, your critique is like this.

335
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,440
Binding has been destroyed.

336
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,920
It's covered in notations.

337
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,920
And it's like a physically important object to you.

338
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,240
And that physical defecation to the book, I think,

339
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,040
actually improves your learning and reading experience.

340
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,480
Even better would be if you wanted to buy or somehow

341
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,640
acquire the physical books.

342
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,960
But I'm not going to require that because, of course,

343
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,800
we're only going to read a little bit of this

344
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,240
and then a little bit of the science of logic.

345
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,720
If I made you buy the books for all this class,

346
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,720
it would be more expensive than I can reasonably expect from you.

347
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,600
OK.

348
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,200
So that is everything that I'm going

349
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,600
to say about course mechanics before we

350
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:06,880
dive into the phenomenology of spirit itself.

351
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:18,200
Let me just say, normally, so GWF Hegel, born in 1770,

352
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,600
you need 31, normally the principle

353
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,880
in which I operate with respect to historical philosophers

354
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,680
is all that we need to say about them is they were born,

355
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,880
they worked, and they died.

356
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,440
Now, I'm going to slightly violate my own rule

357
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:37,360
because I'm a big fan of the digression.

358
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:41,480
And in being a fan of the digression in the lecture,

359
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:45,560
I have no less eminent of precursor than Hegel himself

360
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,440
because in the transcripts of Hegel's lectures, some

361
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,280
of which we will read, Hegel's constantly

362
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,920
going on these digressions, some of which

363
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,840
are totally off topic and some of which are hilarious.

364
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,800
He'll talk about some recent play that's been displayed.

365
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:04,320
So a little bit of digression is fun,

366
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:09,760
distracts us from what Hegel calls the rigor of the concept.

367
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,880
But occasionally, biographical remarks about Hegel

368
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,000
will actually be exegetically relevant.

369
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:18,320
And so I'll say a few things about Hegel's life.

370
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:18,820
OK.

371
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,640
This was all that I want to say initially

372
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,960
about Hegel's philosophy.

373
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:29,160
I don't like beginning a class by giving

374
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,880
this big aerial overview of the philosopher

375
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,560
or the philosophical work precisely because it's

376
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,040
given purely externally.

377
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,800
It's just narration.

378
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,720
It's something you could learn from the Stanford

379
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,520
Encyclopedia of Philosophy or YouTube.

380
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,600
It's not philosophy.

381
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,480
It wouldn't be philosophically justified.

382
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,240
It wouldn't be doing any philosophy for you.

383
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,800
We wouldn't be doing any philosophy together.

384
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,320
I'd just be telling you some stuff.

385
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:00,960
So as we'll see, because Hegel takes very seriously

386
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,600
the ambition that philosophy should develop everything

387
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,000
from itself, it's particularly inappropriate to Hegel

388
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,640
to begin with this external just telling you something,

389
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,840
mere reports.

390
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,720
I would prefer to begin talking about Hegel

391
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,280
by doing philosophy in the Hegelian way, which

392
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,760
is developing it internally just through thinking something

393
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,360
through.

394
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,640
So that's all that I want to say initially

395
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,360
about Hegel's philosophy.

396
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:30,480
I'll just say one or two things more

397
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,640
about what's special about Hegel.

398
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,960
Hegel is probably the most ambitious philosopher

399
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,360
who's ever existed.

400
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,800
So the ambition of Hegel's philosophy

401
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:46,520
is to develop all of this, which is

402
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,380
to say a completely systematic epistemology,

403
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,960
a completely systematic metaphysics,

404
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,400
a completely systematic account of the natural world,

405
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,760
a completely systematic account of the mind, which

406
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,640
includes a completely systematic account

407
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,920
of moral and political philosophy,

408
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,760
a completely systematic account of art and its history,

409
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,400
a completely systematic account of the history of religion,

410
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,880
And true religion, Hegel calls consonant religion,

411
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,760
without any presuppositions.

412
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,000
That's the most ambitious that I think philosophy has ever

413
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,500
gotten.

414
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,360
So Hegel is, in a certain way, the person

415
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:25,760
who has the most faith or confidence in philosophy

416
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,600
that I can think of.

417
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,280
Everyone since Hegel has been more disillusioned

418
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,240
about philosophy.

419
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,280
Or another way of pointing that point

420
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,920
is Hegel is even more than Kant.

421
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,720
The person, the philosopher, with the most confidence

422
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:46,520
that reason, just reasoning, can do everything that we want.

423
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,680
That it can be completely satisfactory.

424
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,480
Reason can be completely self-determinate.

425
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,480
Doesn't need anything outside.

426
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,440
Everyone in philosophy, since Hegel,

427
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,320
has been more pessimistic about the possibility

428
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,280
of this complete self-determination

429
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,880
of rational thought.

430
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,360
Questions about that before we dive

431
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,080
into the phenomenology of spirit itself?

432
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,540
No?

433
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,040
Yeah.

434
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,540
Hey.

435
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,120
I'm not sure what that's supposed to be,

436
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,960
but can I ask something about the question?

437
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Sure.

438
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,000
The question is this.

439
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,040
On the set of us, that's like two, three lines.

440
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,800
But you ask us to contextualize it.

441
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,080
That would require us to pull up Hegel.

442
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,800
But that makes it less space, like one line or two.

443
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
So by two or three sentence, do you

444
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:35,800
make two or three sentence of a whole world together?

445
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:42,080
You're taking, like, we'll figure it out.

446
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:47,000
Yeah, you're taking a rule of thumb too precisely.

447
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,200
Oh, the other thing I want to say

448
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:52,380
is if anyone reads German, I would

449
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:57,800
encourage you to try to read at least some of this in German.

450
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,080
The translations vary a great deal in quality.

451
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,800
And so one of the themes of this semester

452
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,960
that you will probably learn to find really annoying

453
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:11,080
will be complaining about various Hegel translations.

454
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,880
I haven't been hard about whether to use this

455
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,680
as the textbook for the course.

456
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,560
This is the closest thing to a collection

457
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,560
of all of the relevant texts that we

458
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,000
would read in this class.

459
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,880
The reason I decided against it is the translations

460
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,500
are, in some cases, very strange.

461
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:30,740
And the selections are, in some cases, I think not ideal.

462
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,780
And so then I thought, OK, then they're

463
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,860
going to have to listen to me complain, not only

464
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,060
about the translations, but also Holgate selections.

465
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,820
That will open order the hell out of them.

466
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:42,260
So I'll just make my own selections.

467
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,300
Yes?

468
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,020
I don't know if it's too early, but I

469
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,940
want to know how Hegel connects logic to aesthetics and how.

470
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,260
Oh, that's way too early.

471
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:54,940
Way too early.

472
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,100
We're not even.

473
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,180
We don't even know what logic is yet.

474
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,220
That's just a word on a blackboard.

475
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,740
So using the Cambridge translations.

476
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:06,940
Using the Cambridge translations insofar as it's possible.

477
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,500
So the Cambridge translations, the Cambridge Hegel

478
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,080
translations, you might think, oh, my god,

479
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,380
they're going to translate everything.

480
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,380
But they have now translated the phenomenology

481
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:17,580
of spirit, the science of logic, the encyclopedia logic,

482
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,900
the Hegel's writings from Heidelberg, and that's it.

483
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,100
And so you might think, oh, everything's coming out more.

484
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,540
No, Hilary Gaskin, the main philosophy

485
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,980
editor at Cambridge University Press,

486
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,780
has announced it's complete.

487
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,780
That's all they're going to do.

488
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,500
And that's all they ever intended to.

489
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,820
That is not, in fact, a complete story.

490
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:40,100
In fact, so I'll tell you, at some point

491
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,620
when I feel like we need a break,

492
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,820
I'll give you the complete backstory about how

493
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,260
the Cambridge Hegel translation is so radically incomplete.

494
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,300
And it was, of course, never intended to be in complete

495
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,100
this way.

496
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,660
The short answer is they decided to woefully

497
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,340
underpay the editorial order, who all resigned.

498
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:01,020
And then at some point, the new editorial board,

499
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,380
some point Cambridge just realized

500
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,020
it wasn't worth the money.

501
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,660
So we're now in this totally ridiculous situation

502
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:10,460
that there is never going to be, in the foreseeable future,

503
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:13,440
a good, complete translation of the works

504
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,500
of Hegel in England.

505
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,900
So now, OK, I'll say one other thing.

506
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,380
There are two different, there's basically

507
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:25,380
two different editions of the works of Hegel in German.

508
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:29,780
The first one is published by a, is now

509
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:36,660
published by a press in Germany called Zuk.

510
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,340
Those are, if you ever see, they're

511
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:41,300
sort of very dark blue paperbacks.

512
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:46,020
That translation goes back to a translation that was made,

513
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,620
sorry, an edition that was made immediately

514
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,460
after Hegel's death by this group called themselves

515
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,140
the Friends of Hegel.

516
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,580
Now, the problem with that edition

517
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,900
is that it isn't up to contemporary

518
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,900
filmological snuff.

519
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,620
In particular, with respect to Hegel's lectures,

520
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:06,860
they did this thing that from a contemporary point of view

521
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:08,780
was totally outrageous.

522
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:12,060
People, the people who were editing Hegel's lectures,

523
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:15,940
took all of Hegel's notes and the student transcripts

524
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:20,660
and then composed one sort of condensed version

525
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,780
of all of this information and then destroyed,

526
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:27,900
in many cases, the originals so that we can't verify

527
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,460
whether their edition was correct.

528
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:35,580
So this was for, this was until the 70s, the only edition

529
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,500
of Hegel that there was.

530
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:45,020
Now, after that, there's the Academy edition,

531
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,300
where people actually sat down and did

532
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,220
the really philologically respectable thing.

533
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:53,100
I mean, the other thing is, for instance, the Friends of Hegel

534
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,260
edition only contains one edition of the Encyclopedia.

535
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,340
It only contains one edition of the Science of Logic.

536
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,980
That, by contemporary philological standards,

537
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,740
is radically inadequate.

538
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:07,900
The Academy edition does this much more complete job.

539
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,700
But the weird result of that is almost all

540
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,300
of the translations of Hegel into English that

541
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:16,060
existed historically are based on this.

542
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:17,460
And so you would think, well, this

543
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,260
would be a perfect opportunity for Cambridge

544
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,300
to do the English translations from that.

545
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,500
But that's not going to happen because they

546
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,300
underpaid the editorial board.

547
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,140
Also, these editorial board guys,

548
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:28,620
like they're all tenure professors

549
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:29,940
drawing massive salaries.

550
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,500
They could just do it for free.

551
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,900
But I wouldn't tell that to their face.

552
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,740
So the other thing that's weird is,

553
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,300
so there are all these people make a big deal about this.

554
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,260
They just think, oh, you can never

555
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:45,340
talk about Hegel's lectures from the old Friends of Hegel

556
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:45,860
edition.

557
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,900
You have to only cite the Academy edition.

558
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:51,540
But the problem is, almost all of the reception of Hegel

559
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,060
through the history of philosophy

560
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:55,700
from his death in 1831 until whenever this was published

561
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:59,100
in the 60s or 70s was based on the old edition.

562
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:03,140
So these poorly edited editions of Hegel's lectures

563
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,900
are the things that are really influential.

564
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,260
So when people talk about Hegel's philosophy of history,

565
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,980
almost everyone who's ever engaged

566
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:11,140
with Hegel's philosophy of history

567
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,300
was engaging with the poorly edited edition,

568
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,700
including Marx and everyone else.

569
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:21,420
So I think you can't just ignore this one.

570
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,660
In many cases, the older edition, the not so good edition,

571
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,460
makes the text much more readable and fluent.

572
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:31,220
And so when we come to read some of Hegel's lectures,

573
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,220
for instance, his lectures on the philosophy of art,

574
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:37,620
the philosophy of religion, and the history of philosophy,

575
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,540
I will assign some of the translations

576
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,940
from the older editions because they're

577
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:41,900
just more readable.

578
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,980
And they are the things that everyone's been talking about.

579
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:46,100
Ever since, so if you hear someone talking about Hegel

580
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,860
and some other book, they're almost certainly

581
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:48,660
talking about this.

582
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,300
So what value would it be to you?

583
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,620
You're like, oh, well, actually, the Hotho transcript.

584
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,340
You don't care.

585
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,260
I barely care.

586
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:57,980
OK.

587
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,900
Other questions before we start talking

588
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:02,580
about the phenomenology of spirit?

589
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,060
Yes.

590
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,580
I've heard that three years ago,

591
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,900
you called it a people person.

592
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,980
That only went through 40 or 50 pages of the phenomenology.

593
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,460
Yeah.

594
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,140
What would be the content-wise difference

595
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,660
between these two persons in terms of yours?

596
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:21,140
More of you will understand what I'm saying in this course.

597
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,340
Or no, the problem with that course is, so I got through

598
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,540
about, did Siwan tell you that?

599
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,020
Yeah.

600
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,900
OK.

601
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:33,180
Siwan likes that word.

602
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:33,780
So let's see.

603
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,460
If I did 50 pages in that class, I got more than that.

604
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:41,060
I got all the way up to maybe sort of skepticism.

605
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,300
But I kind of rushed through some of skepticism.

606
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,420
So we did maybe like 70 pages.

607
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,980
And the problem with that is you just

608
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:50,340
learn in a lot of detail the early moves

609
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,180
of the phenomenology of spirit, which doesn't tell you.

610
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:58,340
That basically taught people 10% of this.

611
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:05,380
This is 10% of this weird, immature, semi-juvenalia

612
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,660
introduction to Hegel system.

613
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,860
It's not Hegel system.

614
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,380
OK.

615
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,820
But to say more about why just teaching

616
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:15,140
the phenomenology of spirit would be so inadequate,

617
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,180
I mean, certainly this version of 360

618
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:21,380
is an elaborate apology for the last time I taught 360.

619
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:23,220
Let's just dive into the text.

620
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,340
So if you do not have a copy of the text,

621
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,060
rearrange yourself so that you are sitting next to someone

622
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:31,900
who does have a copy of the text.

623
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,700
So I'll give you a few minutes to do that.

624
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,620
So if two of you are sitting next to each other

625
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:44,380
and you have copies of the text, yeah, sorry, what?

626
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,420
Yeah, I mean, there'll be some differences.

627
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:49,300
But you'll basically know what's going on.

628
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,580
Is anyone in a Hegel island isolated

629
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:03,740
from any other copy of the text?

630
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,860
I would have brought additional copies of the text

631
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,060
if I had thought of that.

632
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,340
Yeah, no screen.

633
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,900
OK.

634
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:16,500
It is a natural supposition that in philosophy,

635
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,740
before one gets down to dealing with what is that issue,

636
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:25,060
namely the actual cognition of what in truth is.

637
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:28,620
So the issue of philosophy is actually

638
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:31,180
cognizing what in truth is.

639
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:36,860
Now, there's two words here in German, erkenen and bissen.

640
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:43,900
Pinker has, in almost all cases, translated erkenen

641
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:50,980
has to cognize, and bissen has to know.

642
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,820
But he's, now there is a difference between erkenen

643
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,100
and bissen in Hegel.

644
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:02,020
But erkenen and bissen are both totally ordinary words

645
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,460
in German for knowledge.

646
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:08,820
So epistemology in German is referred to as erketnesteri,

647
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,380
the theory of erketens.

648
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,060
That's the noun for erketens.

649
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,020
So it would be totally fine to translate both of them

650
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,460
as knowledge.

651
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:21,500
But Pinker has decided to just mark in English

652
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,100
a distinction in the German.

653
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,180
So it would be totally fine if we read this as saying,

654
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:29,500
before one gets down to dealing with what is at issue,

655
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:33,780
namely the actual knowledge, actually knowing what is true.

656
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:35,580
So now, Hegel uses the difference

657
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,300
between bissen and erkenen to mark some kind of difference.

658
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,700
But it isn't super crucial right now.

659
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,460
So we can also just read cognition here as knowledge.

660
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,020
It is a natural supposition that in philosophy,

661
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:50,020
before one gets down to dealing with what is at issue,

662
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:53,060
namely the actual knowledge of what in truth is.

663
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,980
So the business of philosophy is actually

664
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:57,340
knowing what in truth is.

665
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,260
So not potentially knowing or kind of knowing or having faith,

666
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:06,820
but knowing and knowing what is true, what is actually true.

667
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,860
It is first necessary to come to an understanding

668
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:12,460
about knowledge, which is regarded

669
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,620
as the instrument by which one seizes hold of the absolute

670
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:20,540
or as the means by which one catches sight of it.

671
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:22,660
So the first word you should stumble over here

672
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,220
is the absolute.

673
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:28,180
So the absolute is this major topic

674
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:34,420
and preoccupation of German philosophy from Kant to Hegel.

675
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,940
So in the context in which Hegel is writing this,

676
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:40,380
roughly Jena in 1807, the absolute

677
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,860
is the thing everyone cares about.

678
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:46,060
But I want to put the absolute aside for a moment,

679
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:50,180
because this is kind of provisional.

680
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:52,180
Over the course of today, you'll understand better

681
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,620
what I mean by this.

682
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:57,180
Hegel won't, in the introduction to the phenomenology,

683
00:32:57,180 --> 00:33:00,100
yet have an argument that the topic of philosophy

684
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:03,100
should be the absolute, or that what the topic of knowledge

685
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,540
is is the absolute.

686
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:08,020
He, over the course of the phenomenology and the logic,

687
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,180
will develop that.

688
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:12,780
So this is a foreshadowing of something

689
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:14,580
that you usually have to argue for,

690
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,180
although his audience in 1807 would assume, of course,

691
00:33:17,180 --> 00:33:20,020
what we really wanted to have knowledge of is the absolute.

692
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:21,820
So what the absolute is, I'm going

693
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,860
to set aside until we see Hegel's view of the absolute.

694
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,860
But if you need a sort of precursor,

695
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,500
you can think of it as God a little bit better.

696
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:33,500
You can think of it as the unconditioned in Kant.

697
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,540
A little bit better, you can think of it as Spinoza's God.

698
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:43,540
Even better, you could think of it as Spinoza's God,

699
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,660
where Spinoza's God is understood neither

700
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:48,860
determinately as a subject or as an object.

701
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,060
And if that sounds very weird, that's fine.

702
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,820
We'll come back to it.

703
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:58,420
So the important thing about paragraph 73,

704
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,740
the beginning of the introduction,

705
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:04,780
is Hegel is playing off various tropes in modern philosophy.

706
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:07,020
So when you read the beginning of the introduction

707
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,260
of phenomenology, you should think of the beginning

708
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:11,700
of Locke's essay, concerning the understanding,

709
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,860
or the beginning of conscripti capuris.

710
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,900
The characteristic move of modern philosophy

711
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,700
is before we investigate the object,

712
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:21,260
we have to investigate the cognitive powers

713
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,660
of the subject.

714
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,900
So what Hegel does now is then riff on various tropes

715
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,500
in modern philosophy.

716
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,460
So he's presenting this thing that you would normally assume.

717
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,340
It is a natural supposition.

718
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:37,300
Although we'll see that in a certain way,

719
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,940
Hegel doesn't share this supposition.

720
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,700
He's distancing himself from this supposition.

721
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,420
So the natural supposition is, before we

722
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,140
go about the business of knowing objects,

723
00:34:45,140 --> 00:34:49,340
we first have to investigate the power of the knowledge

724
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:49,840
itself.

725
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:51,620
We have to know what knowledge is.

726
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:55,260
So he then riffs on various metaphors

727
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,260
that you find in early modern philosophy.

728
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,660
For one, there might be one rather than another form

729
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,700
of cognition that is better suited to achieving

730
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:05,380
this final end.

731
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,860
So the idea is, well, you have to decide,

732
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:11,740
is it the senses that give us knowledge of what is?

733
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,260
Or is it the intellect?

734
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,860
Or is it reason if there's a difference

735
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,220
between the intellect and reason?

736
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:18,220
Is it faith that gives us knowledge of what is?

737
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,540
So those are the kinds of issues that he's gesturing.

738
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,340
If cognition is a faculty of a determinant kind and scope,

739
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,100
then without a more precise determination

740
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:30,940
of its nature and limits, one ends up grasping clouds of error

741
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:32,500
rather than the heaven of truth.

742
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:35,420
So if knowledge is a particular human ability

743
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,780
among other abilities, then there

744
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,700
are things that that ability can be exercised with respect to

745
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,940
and things that it cannot be exercised with respect to.

746
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,220
So we have to get clarity on that before we

747
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:48,060
try to go about knowing objects.

748
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,980
If cognition is the instrument for seizing hold

749
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,620
of the absolute, then we don't get the absolute

750
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,060
as it is in itself, but we form and change.

751
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:58,860
So the idea of, if cognition is something like a tool,

752
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:02,460
then what it gets us is not the object in itself,

753
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,540
but the object introverse that's shaped by the tool.

754
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,660
So once again, these are not things

755
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,900
I think Hegel needs to put a lot of argumentative weight on.

756
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:14,980
What he's doing is pointing out that these standard moves

757
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:19,380
in modern epistemology bring with them these kinds of thoughts.

758
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:24,460
And he's raising this as a way you could begin in philosophy,

759
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:26,460
but then also distancing himself by them

760
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,940
by pointing out that those kinds of moves in modern philosophy

761
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:35,380
bring with them very familiar concerns about whether we'll

762
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,580
ever be able to know reality as it is in itself.

763
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,620
Most importantly, in 1807, the thing that's

764
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:45,460
always in the back of Hegel's mind is Kant and the idea

765
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:48,620
that Kant's investigation to the powers of human mind

766
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:51,220
in the critique of pure reason winds up

767
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:54,740
proving that we don't know reality as it is in itself.

768
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,220
So he's riffing on all these various thoughts

769
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:01,900
that if you begin by investigating knowledge

770
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:07,660
itself, you'll always wind up being distanced from the object

771
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:10,460
as it is in itself.

772
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:13,180
Likewise, if we think of knowledge as a passive medium,

773
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,740
well, if you really think through the idea of a passive medium,

774
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:19,580
a medium kind of changes what passes through it.

775
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,420
And so then you can kind of remove.

776
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:31,580
So the metaphor is, well, if it's a medium changes,

777
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,380
the light passes into glass.

778
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,140
There's an angle of refraction.

779
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:41,500
So if we know this, maybe we can infer exactly where

780
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,020
the thing came from.

781
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:45,100
But then all we'll know is the direction

782
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:47,140
from which the ray came from.

783
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:52,860
So Hegel is just riffing on standard metaphors

784
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:54,980
about knowledge in modern philosophy

785
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,980
and very familiar reasons for thinking

786
00:37:57,980 --> 00:38:00,780
that if you think of knowledge that way,

787
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,860
you will wind up with a conclusion

788
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,460
that you don't know reality as it is itself,

789
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,300
you know it only as it appears to you,

790
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:10,740
or you know it only in relation to the human mind,

791
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,580
et cetera, et cetera.

792
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,060
Yeah.

793
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:18,940
So how much we have prior knowledge of the world,

794
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:23,140
and how he gets to the absoluteness?

795
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:28,380
Is it relative to us, or is it universal?

796
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:30,860
We're way too early to get there.

797
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,100
We're at super, super preliminary steps here.

798
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,940
So now I'm going to just, because this is not the last time

799
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,060
I'm on 2016 where I only got 370 pages,

800
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,060
I'm not going to go through sentence by sentence.

801
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:43,260
I'm going to jump through to particular passages

802
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:46,060
that I think are eliminated.

803
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:50,660
So then paragraph 74 begins, and he says, well, look,

804
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:59,300
if this we could just as well, so let me just read this passage.

805
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,660
If the common concern about falling into error

806
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:04,660
sets up a mistrust of science, which itself,

807
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,900
untroubled by such scruples, simply sets itself to work

808
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,020
and actually cognizes it, it is still

809
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:12,140
difficult to say why on the contrary,

810
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:15,380
a mistrust of this mistrust should not be set up,

811
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,180
and why one should not be concerned

812
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:21,420
that this fear of erring is already the error itself.

813
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,500
So what he's pointing out is the things that

814
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,580
get us into a mistrust or skepticism

815
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:31,020
about our ability to know are themselves something

816
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:33,020
that we could be skeptical about.

817
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:36,660
In particular, we don't have to assume

818
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:42,140
that knowledge is an instrument or a tool or a passive media

819
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:46,380
or one ability among others, that those themselves,

820
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:50,540
those standard assumptions that structure modern epistemology

821
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,340
and that lead to the conclusion that we don't know realities

822
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:58,980
of itself are themselves something that is questionable.

823
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:03,660
Skipping a little bit, but above all, this picture

824
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,580
that he's been somewhat satirically riffing on

825
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,580
presupposes that the absolute stands on one side

826
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,780
and that cognition stands on the other or itself

827
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,820
and separated from the absolute, though cognition is

828
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:18,660
nevertheless something real.

829
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,980
So what he's saying is the assumption here

830
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:25,940
in all of this stuff, let's just once again, for now,

831
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:30,020
treat the absolute as the object of knowledge.

832
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:37,900
The assumption is I'm over here, the object is a distinct being,

833
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:45,020
and then somehow I have to overcome this distinctness

834
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,740
in order to know.

835
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,620
And the standard early modern thought

836
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,900
is, well, how could I know an object that's distinct for me?

837
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:57,420
Well, it would have to affect me, have to affect my senses.

838
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,180
And I would have to have some capacity

839
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:02,380
to be affected sensorily by it.

840
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:06,020
And then all of these early modern worries

841
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:08,980
from Locke, Hume, Kant, Descartes, everyone else,

842
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:15,220
arise, namely, would that allow us to know the object as it is

843
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,580
or only as it affects us?

844
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,380
Would it allow us to know the way the object really is

845
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,740
or only as it appears to our senses?

846
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:27,860
So he's pointing out that that very standard picture

847
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:32,300
of knowledge as a particular relation of one being

848
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,940
to another, or let's say, a capacity that one being has

849
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:39,860
to know another being or other beings,

850
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,140
is itself something we can question.

851
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,580
We're not stuck with that.

852
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:47,660
OK.

853
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:49,980
I'm going to skip 73.

854
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:50,940
OK.

855
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:54,980
So now he says, look, instead of fussing around with answers

856
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,780
to all of this, that is to say, instead of fussing around

857
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:03,540
with the whole problem space of early modern epistemology,

858
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,300
empiricism, rationalism, sensibility, understanding,

859
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,920
reason, instead of all of that, instead of fussing around

860
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,700
with answers to all of this, it is

861
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,940
possible to reject these outright

862
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:16,420
as contingent and arbitrary representations

863
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:18,540
and to regard the affiliated use of words,

864
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,100
such as absolute cognition, and also objective and subjective,

865
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,020
and countless others, whose meaning is assumed

866
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:27,020
to be generally known as even a kind of deceit.

867
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,060
So one thing we can do is step back and say,

868
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,900
the meaning of subject, object, cognition, absolutely,

869
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:35,660
they themselves are things that have to be determined.

870
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,860
It's not self-evident what these things mean,

871
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:41,980
and it's not self-evident that we have to begin philosophy

872
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,220
by assuming a particular meaning of them

873
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,660
or a particular set up for epistemology, namely,

874
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,620
that one, skipping a little bit.

875
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:53,060
They constitute only an empty appearance

876
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,340
of a knowing, which immediately vanishes

877
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,860
in the face of the science, which comes onto the scene.

878
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,380
OK.

879
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,820
So just a little note about language.

880
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:04,220
Bissen is to know.

881
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:11,860
Bissenschaft is science.

882
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:14,980
But that means just etymologically in German,

883
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:19,020
there's a very close connection between Bissen and Bissenschaft.

884
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:24,740
So for now, Hegel has a very distinctive notion

885
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:26,740
of what a Bissenschaft is.

886
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:28,020
He hasn't developed it yet.

887
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:30,580
So let's just take on board the idea

888
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:35,820
that if the aim of philosophy is to know, to have Bissen,

889
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:38,500
the aim of philosophy is to be a Bissenschaft,

890
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:42,460
that is to say, to be a science, a body of knowing.

891
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:44,660
Now, this is unnatural in English

892
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,340
because we have two different words.

893
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,660
And because we have this, frankly,

894
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,100
stupid tendency in English to assume that the word science

895
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:55,340
only applies to the natural sciences.

896
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,260
That just doesn't make sense in German.

897
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,060
In German, the study of literature

898
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:01,020
is the Tsozwe Bissenschaft, the study of politics

899
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:03,100
is Politische Bissenschaft.

900
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:07,940
Any systematically ordered body of knowledge is Bissenschaft.

901
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:10,460
So the introduction of science at this point

902
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,980
is not as arbitrary as it seems, although over the course

903
00:44:13,980 --> 00:44:17,140
of the system, we'll get a much, much richer notion of science.

904
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:20,700
So all that Hegel is doing is saying, look,

905
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,380
it's standard to begin by assuming

906
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:26,140
that we want in philosophy is knowledge,

907
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,740
that is to say, scientific knowing, science,

908
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:30,380
of what actually is.

909
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:33,340
And the standard way we begin is by assuming this.

910
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,980
But this leads very quickly by arguments

911
00:44:36,020 --> 00:44:38,420
that are familiar from early modern philosophy

912
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:41,140
to the conclusion that we don't know objects

913
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,260
as they are in themselves.

914
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:46,380
We only know their appearances or other structural features.

915
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:48,700
Or even more radically, in Hume, in some way,

916
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:51,020
we don't really know anything other than our own impressions

917
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:53,300
of objects.

918
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,660
But we don't have to assume that because it's not obvious

919
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:59,340
what any of these terms mean.

920
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,660
OK.

921
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:03,540
But then he says, all of this vanishes

922
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,860
when science comes on the scene.

923
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:09,340
So when someone who has scientific knowing,

924
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:12,300
who knows what, in actuality, is the case,

925
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:15,020
and does so scientifically, when they show up,

926
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,860
all of the rest of this is revealed to be deceit.

927
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:22,660
But science, insofar as it comes on the scene,

928
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,660
is itself an appearance.

929
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:28,140
Science is coming onto the scene is not yet science

930
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:31,260
as it is carried out and unfolded in its truth.

931
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:36,740
So if I don't have knowledge, I just

932
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:41,220
have various beliefs involving these concepts.

933
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:44,540
I'm just a standard early modern epistemology person.

934
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:47,780
And someone comes on the scene who does have knowing,

935
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,700
that's just one more claim to knowledge among others.

936
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,700
We don't yet know who has knowledge.

937
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,900
Merely, the first appearance of knowing,

938
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,180
the first person who knows, doesn't necessarily

939
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,100
know that they know.

940
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,820
So Hegel goes on to say, for with regard

941
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:05,980
to a knowing that is not truthful,

942
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:09,700
science cannot simply reject it as just a common view of things

943
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:12,420
while giving out the assurance that it is itself

944
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,620
a completely different kind of cognition

945
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:17,060
and that the other knowing counts as absolutely nothing

946
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:19,260
for science.

947
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,620
Skip the rest of the sentence, through such an assurance,

948
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,420
science declares its being to be its power.

949
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:28,540
But untrue knowing, just as much appeals to the fact

950
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:33,100
that it is, and it gives out the assurance that science counts

951
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:36,820
as nothing to it, but one bear assurance

952
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:38,500
is just as valid as another.

953
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:40,300
So bear assurance is the old translation.

954
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,540
It just sounds better.

955
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:43,820
It's perfectly fine.

956
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:44,780
So what does that mean?

957
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:49,620
What it means is, if you don't know but have mere opinion,

958
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:56,380
and I come on the scene and I know,

959
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:01,220
my assertion that I know is worth just as much

960
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:06,260
as your assertion that you know, even if I know.

961
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:10,860
So the issue here is how we know what knowledge is,

962
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:15,180
or how we justify our epistemic standard.

963
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:19,740
So the issue is not knowledge of objects.

964
00:47:19,740 --> 00:47:22,580
It's knowledge of what knowledge is.

965
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:26,780
So the idea is, it's not enough simply to know,

966
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:30,380
because your claim to know is just a mere assertion,

967
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,980
a bear assurance, just as valid and just as invalid

968
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,980
as the person who doesn't actually know their claim to know.

969
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,020
So we need to find somewhere to adjudicate

970
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:46,660
between the mere claim to knowledge, mere opinion,

971
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:48,420
and knowledge.

972
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,940
So knowing is agreement?

973
00:47:51,940 --> 00:47:53,260
Argument?

974
00:47:53,260 --> 00:47:54,180
Agreement.

975
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,740
Agreement, no.

976
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,500
OK.

977
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,260
Skipping a bit, 77.

978
00:47:59,260 --> 00:48:03,100
Because this exposition has for its object only

979
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:05,780
knowing as it appears.

980
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:07,420
So what we're going to do is we're

981
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:09,620
going to look at appearances of knowledge.

982
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,460
That is to say, claims to know.

983
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,660
But once again, we're not interested in particular.

984
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:19,020
I claim to know that Bismarck is the capital of South Dakota.

985
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,780
I claim to know that Fargo is not the capital of South Dakota.

986
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:26,420
Maybe someone, some poor, benated, Canadian,

987
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:30,900
ignorant of the geography of the Upper Midwest, my homeland,

988
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:34,980
might claim to know falsely that Fargo is the capital of South

989
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:35,660
Dakota.

990
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:38,300
It is not.

991
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,140
We're not interested in that.

992
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:45,420
We're interested in the sort of one level more general

993
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:50,060
about what you think knowledge is.

994
00:48:50,060 --> 00:48:54,340
So the exposition has for its object only knowing as it appears.

995
00:48:54,340 --> 00:49:00,260
That is to say, appearances of conceptions of knowledge.

996
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:02,340
So you have a conception of what knowledge is.

997
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,300
I have a conception of what knowledge is.

998
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:10,580
Even if my conception is right, let's just assume yours is right.

999
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,860
My claim about what knowledge is is just as valid as yours.

1000
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:16,740
One is just to bear assurance just as much as the other.

1001
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:19,180
It does not itself seem to be the science, which

1002
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:23,100
is free and self-moving within its own proper shape.

1003
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:27,620
So this exposition does not itself seem to be the science.

1004
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:32,100
So when Hegel says something doesn't appear or merely appears,

1005
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:33,620
that's really important.

1006
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:37,340
So he's saying you would think at the beginning

1007
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:39,820
this exposition is not going to be science

1008
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,660
because we don't know what science is yet.

1009
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:43,660
We don't know what knowledge is.

1010
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:46,820
It will actually turn out to be more complicated than that later on.

1011
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:49,500
But let's just take the appearance at face value for now.

1012
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:54,420
So this exposition where there's an appearance of knowing

1013
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,940
is just someone's claim to knowing backed up

1014
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,540
by some conception of knowledge.

1015
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:02,700
That doesn't look to be knowing yet because they

1016
00:50:02,700 --> 00:50:04,940
don't know that they know.

1017
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:06,700
But from this standpoint can instead

1018
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:10,540
be taken to be the path of natural consciousness,

1019
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:13,300
pressing forward towards true knowing.

1020
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,420
It can be taken to be the path of the soul wandering

1021
00:50:17,420 --> 00:50:19,900
through this series of ways it takes shape,

1022
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:23,340
as if these were stations put forward in advance to it

1023
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:27,900
by its own nature so that it purifies itself into spirit

1024
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:31,980
by arriving at a cognition of what it is in itself

1025
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,420
through the complete experience of its own self.

1026
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:39,940
So that description, 77 is a description of this book.

1027
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:44,660
It's an exposition, which appears not to be science

1028
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,780
itself yet, and let's stick with the appearance.

1029
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:50,220
Let's assume that this is from the first page not yet science,

1030
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:52,740
but merely the appearance of science.

1031
00:50:52,740 --> 00:50:56,180
But what it really is is it's the path of natural consciousness.

1032
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:57,700
So what is natural consciousness?

1033
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,860
It's something like the conception of knowledge

1034
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,860
we begin with pre-philosophically.

1035
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,660
Very roughly, it's this.

1036
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:08,900
It's the idea that there's a distinction

1037
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:13,380
between consciousness, the subject,

1038
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:16,500
and its other, the object, and that consciousness

1039
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:19,060
has to somehow overcome that, maybe

1040
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:22,300
by the object affecting its senses, et cetera, et cetera.

1041
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:25,340
This is natural consciousness.

1042
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,780
So the exposition, this book is going

1043
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:37,820
to be an exposition of the path of natural consciousness

1044
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:42,140
pressing forwards towards true known, towards science.

1045
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,980
Or it can be taken to be the path of the soul wandering

1046
00:51:44,980 --> 00:51:47,460
through the series of ways it takes shape.

1047
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:49,660
So the phenomenology of this will

1048
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:52,940
be an exposition of different shapes or forms

1049
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:56,940
of consciousness, which means different conceptions

1050
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:59,740
of what knowledge is, different conceptions

1051
00:51:59,740 --> 00:52:04,540
of the relationship between consciousness and its object.

1052
00:52:04,540 --> 00:52:07,780
As if these were stations put forward in advance to it

1053
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,340
by its own nature.

1054
00:52:09,340 --> 00:52:12,420
So these stations, these different forms of consciousness,

1055
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:14,380
are not given to it from outside,

1056
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:18,460
but they develop out of it itself,

1057
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:21,780
so that it purifies itself into spirit

1058
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:25,140
by arriving at a cognition of what it is in itself

1059
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:28,140
through the complete experience of its own self.

1060
00:52:28,140 --> 00:52:31,140
So this is going to be the exposition

1061
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:34,980
of how natural consciousness becomes spirit,

1062
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:40,300
and therefore truly knows itself and has scientific knowledge.

1063
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:42,340
Now, what is this exposition?

1064
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:46,820
What is the character of the exposition of the phenomenology?

1065
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:50,060
So one very standard way of reading the phenomenology

1066
00:52:50,060 --> 00:52:53,780
that I think is totally wrong is to think of it

1067
00:52:53,780 --> 00:53:01,740
as an historical description of various shapes of human

1068
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:03,100
consciousness over time.

1069
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,220
So on this reading, some of the beginning of the book

1070
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:07,740
is like Stone Age consciousness, and by the end

1071
00:53:07,740 --> 00:53:10,380
we have like early 19th century German consciousness.

1072
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:13,820
This has various problems, one of which

1073
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:16,900
is it gets the chronology as out of order.

1074
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,980
So somehow like Newtonian science comes before the Greeks.

1075
00:53:22,180 --> 00:53:23,940
There are other problems with it, namely,

1076
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:26,020
it makes the whole book completely incoherent.

1077
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:32,540
It turns it into the world's most incoherently written

1078
00:53:32,540 --> 00:53:34,100
piece of intellectual history.

1079
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:38,380
It's like Will Durant, as written by Hegel.

1080
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,100
And it also completely undermines

1081
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:43,460
the philosophical account, because what happened does not

1082
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:46,020
in and of itself have any necessity.

1083
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:47,660
So I don't think that it's historical.

1084
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,700
I think that this exposition is a purely

1085
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,300
philosophical or logical.

1086
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,180
So what we do is we start with natural consciousness, which

1087
00:53:56,180 --> 00:53:58,220
is a conception of what knowing is.

1088
00:53:58,220 --> 00:54:00,380
It's roughly this.

1089
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:02,540
As we'll see, it's going to start even more minimally

1090
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,020
than this.

1091
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:15,500
We're going to start with this, and then we're

1092
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:19,500
going to develop out of this other shapes of consciousness,

1093
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:22,540
other conceptions of what knowledge is,

1094
00:54:22,540 --> 00:54:27,940
till we get to what Hegel identifies as science, what

1095
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,980
he identifies as the knowing of the absolute,

1096
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:36,540
and what he here identifies as consciousness becoming spirit.

1097
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:40,620
Now, all of those things are going to be the same.

1098
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:43,020
They're all going to be identical.

1099
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,140
But let me just say something about the latter.

1100
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:47,740
What does it mean that consciousness becomes spirit?

1101
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,460
As Hegel says at the end of 77, it's

1102
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:54,620
not that consciousness wasn't spirit and then becomes spirit.

1103
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:58,660
It's that consciousness becomes aware of itself as spirit.

1104
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,420
So one way of thinking about the phenomenology, the one

1105
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:05,180
that I'm going to emphasize, is its consciousness developing

1106
00:55:05,180 --> 00:55:07,660
out of itself a series of shapes of consciousness,

1107
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:10,140
conceptions of knowing, until it gets to one

1108
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,660
that is knowing, full stop.

1109
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,940
True scientific knowing of what in actuality is.

1110
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:20,860
That will turn out also to be knowledge of the absolute.

1111
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:24,780
For the preview of incredibly weird Hegel stuff to come,

1112
00:55:24,780 --> 00:55:28,020
it will turn out that that is the absolute.

1113
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,580
The absolute is the absolute knowing itself.

1114
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:31,860
And you can be part of it too.

1115
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:39,020
But the thing I just want to mention now

1116
00:55:39,020 --> 00:55:41,220
is it will also be consciousness coming

1117
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:44,980
to know what it itself is, namely, spirit.

1118
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,620
Now we're going to talk a lot more about spirit in this class

1119
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,660
because it's one of the three parts of the system.

1120
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:59,060
And we'll spend roughly half this whole semester on spirit.

1121
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:06,660
What exactly spirit is in Hegel is if you gave me a pop quiz

1122
00:56:06,660 --> 00:56:08,980
and gave me a blue book and said you have three hours to say

1123
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:11,100
what spirit is for Hegel, I think

1124
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,660
I would throw myself out of a window.

1125
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:14,740
I don't really know how I would do that.

1126
00:56:14,740 --> 00:56:20,340
But let me just say very briefly something about the word.

1127
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:24,660
The word in German is geist.

1128
00:56:24,660 --> 00:56:25,500
OK.

1129
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,460
Now, sometimes that gets translated in English

1130
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:32,900
as spirit, sometimes it gets translated as mind.

1131
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:34,460
So in particular, the translation

1132
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,960
of the philosophy of spirit that we're

1133
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:39,300
going to read, the only one ever published in English

1134
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,660
because Cambridge underpaid the editorial board,

1135
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,700
translated as the philosophy of mind.

1136
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:50,540
Now, what is the relationship between spirit and mind?

1137
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:53,060
They're the same word in German.

1138
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:55,580
If you want to say that someone lost his mind in German,

1139
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:58,060
you say, he hasein geistfel.

1140
00:56:58,060 --> 00:57:02,260
So we have two words where the Germans have won.

1141
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:06,540
Now, Hegel is exploiting a feature of German, which

1142
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:12,220
is that the word that you would use for my individual mind,

1143
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,740
is also the word that you would use

1144
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:19,260
for collective mental phenomena, like the spirit of the age.

1145
00:57:19,260 --> 00:57:24,660
If you say in English, the mind of the 19th century,

1146
00:57:24,660 --> 00:57:26,340
people will be like, what?

1147
00:57:26,340 --> 00:57:27,020
What's that like?

1148
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:28,220
That sounds like the board.

1149
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:29,940
Everyone in the 19th century was hooked up

1150
00:57:29,940 --> 00:57:32,420
into some big telepathic worldwide web.

1151
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:37,100
Now, if you say zeitgeist, the spirit of the age in German,

1152
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,300
that sounds totally normal.

1153
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:40,460
So what Hegel is playing on the fact

1154
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:44,660
that there's one word for individual mental phenomena

1155
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:46,380
and collective mental phenomena.

1156
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:49,340
Because what he wants us to see is

1157
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:52,140
that those aren't really separate things.

1158
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:55,660
Not that there's only one mind and we're all parts of it,

1159
00:57:55,660 --> 00:58:00,060
or that the collective mind is just the combination

1160
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:02,220
of the little minds, as Margaret Thatcher famously said,

1161
00:58:02,220 --> 00:58:03,860
there's no such thing as society.

1162
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,860
But neither of those views.

1163
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:09,860
As always in Hegel, a third weirder thing.

1164
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:13,300
But just very briefly, what matters

1165
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:16,180
in the phenomenology of spirit is

1166
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:19,100
that over the course of the phenomenology,

1167
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:23,540
consciousness comes to realize that it's spirit.

1168
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:25,780
Consciousness comes to realize that it's a mind.

1169
00:58:25,780 --> 00:58:26,740
No, no, no.

1170
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:30,380
He means spirit in a more technical sense.

1171
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,540
Consciousness will come to realize

1172
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:36,740
that there is no difference between it and its author.

1173
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:41,700
Spirit is mind in so far as it understands

1174
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,780
that it has no other.

1175
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:46,780
Now that is not going to mean that everything is spirit.

1176
00:58:46,780 --> 00:58:50,500
So Hegel's view is not like this is spirit.

1177
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:54,660
Hegel's fully aware that there is no spirit on the moon.

1178
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:57,740
The view that the phenomenology is building up towards

1179
00:58:57,740 --> 00:59:03,820
is that the other of spirit, nature, things that have reality

1180
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:07,260
but aren't minds, are not fundamentally

1181
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,940
different from spirit.

1182
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:12,420
So that although spirit has another,

1183
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,860
its other isn't fundamentally other to it.

1184
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:18,780
Or it's the same structurally as spirit.

1185
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:20,060
Now this is all provisional.

1186
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,060
All of this is going to be worked out

1187
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:23,220
in the rest of the system.

1188
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:27,740
But the basic idea is that spirit is consciousness

1189
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:30,660
raised to the point where it understands

1190
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:35,460
that the basic structure in which consciousness thinks

1191
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:38,620
is the same structure as what it thinks about.

1192
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:41,660
So although there's a difference between myself and the object,

1193
00:59:41,660 --> 00:59:43,180
it's not an ultimate difference.

1194
00:59:43,180 --> 00:59:47,900
The way I think about things is fundamentally the way they are.

1195
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,660
And what's important for Hegel is

1196
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:51,620
that we're going to prove that.

1197
00:59:51,620 --> 00:59:53,740
We're not going to presuppose it.

1198
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:56,900
Hegel's way of thinking about this, preconti and rationalism

1199
00:59:56,900 --> 01:00:00,700
just presupposes that the categories of thought,

1200
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,500
basically subject, predicate, and logic,

1201
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:05,860
are the metaphysical structure of being.

1202
01:00:05,860 --> 01:00:07,620
Or they assume something even worse,

1203
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:10,500
which is that God just decided, because he's

1204
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,980
nice, to set things up that way.

1205
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,500
Because what God really cares about

1206
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:17,340
is that we do metaphysics properly.

1207
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:20,100
The murder of innocence and the complete slaughter field

1208
01:00:20,100 --> 01:00:22,740
that is history was relatively different to him.

1209
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:24,580
He was figuring out how to create the world.

1210
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:26,980
But he was like, wait, if I do it this way,

1211
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:29,540
there's going to be all these genocides and all this slavery

1212
01:00:29,540 --> 01:00:30,620
and all this horrible shit.

1213
01:00:30,620 --> 01:00:32,740
But they'll be able to do metaphysics.

1214
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:33,660
Yes, I'll do that.

1215
01:00:33,660 --> 01:00:35,980
So Hegel thinks that's even worse.

1216
01:00:35,980 --> 01:00:40,100
So what we need to do over the course of the system

1217
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,740
is show that consciousness has to be spirit.

1218
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:46,540
That is to say, there can't be a fundamental difference

1219
01:00:46,540 --> 01:00:51,980
between the categories in which thought thinks and the beings

1220
01:00:51,980 --> 01:00:52,980
that it thinks about.

1221
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:54,860
And so that's going to mean that there's

1222
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,900
a structural identity between spirit and nature.

1223
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,180
Yes?

1224
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:00,940
The individual mental phenomena,

1225
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:03,740
collective mental phenomena, are key names

1226
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:07,580
or is it too much experience?

1227
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:09,740
You're getting ahead of us.

1228
01:01:09,740 --> 01:01:10,980
We're not there yet.

1229
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:11,940
Yeah, Isaac, right.

1230
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:12,740
Yeah.

1231
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,140
So is there any comparable traits

1232
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:16,980
between the non-monetary atmosphere

1233
01:01:16,980 --> 01:01:20,180
and the non-monology of this technology in 20th century?

1234
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:22,740
Is there any connection at all?

1235
01:01:22,820 --> 01:01:24,340
I will answer that question when we

1236
01:01:24,340 --> 01:01:26,980
get to a particular passage.

1237
01:01:26,980 --> 01:01:30,900
Notice the word phenomenology has not been used yet.

1238
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:34,140
Maybe a bit naive, but why start with natural consciousness?

1239
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,660
We will get there.

1240
01:01:35,660 --> 01:01:36,140
Yeah?

1241
01:01:36,140 --> 01:01:38,620
What is the concept of what is the notion?

1242
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:42,620
Oh, it's the bad old English translation of the concept.

1243
01:01:42,620 --> 01:01:44,740
To the next question, what is the concept?

1244
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:48,460
That's, we will, it's going to take us a couple weeks.

1245
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,460
But it doesn't use it here.

1246
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:52,060
He uses it here, but he uses it in a non-technical sense

1247
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,460
here to mean something like one's conception.

1248
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:55,460
OK.

1249
01:01:55,460 --> 01:01:56,460
Yeah.

1250
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,700
I know you said consciousness realizes that it's spirit.

1251
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:04,420
Maybe it's a silly question, but what's the difference

1252
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:07,260
before we know, before I as a consciousness realize

1253
01:02:07,260 --> 01:02:08,740
that I am spirit?

1254
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:11,780
What is the difference between spirit and consciousness?

1255
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:15,220
It's the difference between being something

1256
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:17,940
and being aware of yourself as being that.

1257
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,500
So your spirit all along.

1258
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,660
Where consciousness is always spirit,

1259
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,300
but it doesn't grasp itself as spirit.

1260
01:02:25,300 --> 01:02:28,060
Or I mean, once again, it's important not

1261
01:02:28,060 --> 01:02:29,980
to think of this temporally.

1262
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:32,620
This is not about a guy named consciousness

1263
01:02:32,620 --> 01:02:35,020
who realizes at the end that he's spirit.

1264
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:36,780
It's about consciousness.

1265
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:40,380
And consciousness is spirit, but at the level

1266
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:44,180
at which we describe consciousness at the beginning,

1267
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:47,220
that is not a description of consciousness as spirit.

1268
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:49,820
What we're going to do is unfold from that description

1269
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:52,100
of consciousness, just from what consciousness is so

1270
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,460
described that it must be spirit.

1271
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:56,140
OK.

1272
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:56,900
Moving on.

1273
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:58,660
Natural consciousness will prove

1274
01:02:58,660 --> 01:03:00,860
to be only the concept of knowing,

1275
01:03:00,860 --> 01:03:02,580
or it will prove to be not real knowing.

1276
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:03,100
OK, good.

1277
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,340
So this is a non-technical use of concept.

1278
01:03:05,340 --> 01:03:06,740
This is something like what we mean

1279
01:03:06,740 --> 01:03:08,220
by concept in the ordinary sense.

1280
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:09,500
It's a conception of knowing.

1281
01:03:09,500 --> 01:03:12,500
So natural consciousness thinks of itself as knowing,

1282
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:15,100
and it has a conception of knowing, namely this one.

1283
01:03:15,100 --> 01:03:17,780
But it will prove to be not real knowing.

1284
01:03:17,780 --> 01:03:19,580
He also said already for that.

1285
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:22,940
While it immediately regards itself rather as real knowing,

1286
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:25,380
this path has negative meaning for it.

1287
01:03:25,380 --> 01:03:27,380
And what is the realization of the concept

1288
01:03:27,380 --> 01:03:30,500
will count instead to it as the loss of itself,

1289
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:34,460
for on this path, it loses its truth.

1290
01:03:34,460 --> 01:03:36,900
In this exposition, consciousness

1291
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,860
is going to realize that what it thinks knowing is is not

1292
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:41,740
knowing.

1293
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:45,420
So the truth that it thinks it knows, it doesn't know.

1294
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,380
This path could accordingly be regarded

1295
01:03:47,380 --> 01:03:50,220
as the path of doubt, or more properly,

1296
01:03:50,220 --> 01:03:52,500
as the path of despair.

1297
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,140
On this path, what happens is not

1298
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:57,620
what is customarily understood as doubt,

1299
01:03:57,620 --> 01:04:00,180
a shaking of this or that supposed truth,

1300
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:02,500
followed by the disappearance again of the doubt,

1301
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:05,300
and then a return to the former, so that in the end,

1302
01:04:05,300 --> 01:04:07,940
the thing at issue is taken as it was before.

1303
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:10,780
Rather, this path is the conscious insight

1304
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:13,540
into the untruth of knowing as it appears.

1305
01:04:13,540 --> 01:04:16,860
A knowing for which that which is the most real

1306
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:21,540
is rather in truth only the unrealized concept.

1307
01:04:21,540 --> 01:04:24,660
So what that means is consciousness

1308
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,620
is going to realize, not that it's wrong about it

1309
01:04:27,620 --> 01:04:29,980
thought it knew something, but it didn't know that thing.

1310
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,620
It thought it knew that Fargo is the capital of North Dakota,

1311
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:33,140
but it isn't.

1312
01:04:36,020 --> 01:04:39,900
Or it's nor is it going to doubt, it's

1313
01:04:39,900 --> 01:04:42,860
going to say, well, there's a bunch of stuff I don't know.

1314
01:04:42,860 --> 01:04:45,300
I don't know anything about how things are in themselves.

1315
01:04:45,380 --> 01:04:47,060
I didn't know the external world.

1316
01:04:47,060 --> 01:04:50,860
What it's going to doubt is its conception of knowledge.

1317
01:04:50,860 --> 01:04:54,900
And that is the loss of itself, because a conception

1318
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:57,340
of knowledge is a conception by consciousness

1319
01:04:57,340 --> 01:04:59,180
of what consciousness is.

1320
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:02,420
So in losing that, it loses itself.

1321
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:05,180
So there's this kind of existential dimension.

1322
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:08,780
These are losses of self-conceptions.

1323
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:13,140
So the phenomenology is also an exposition

1324
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:15,100
of a sequence of self-conceptions

1325
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:18,740
that consciousness might have of itself.

1326
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,940
I'm going to skip a bunch.

1327
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:23,300
So we know where we start, natural consciousness.

1328
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:25,740
Although we don't really know what natural consciousness is,

1329
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:27,900
this is my preliminary sketch of it.

1330
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,540
He hasn't really told us what natural consciousness is.

1331
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:33,500
We know roughly where things are going to end.

1332
01:05:33,500 --> 01:05:38,100
They're going to end with scientific knowledge,

1333
01:05:38,100 --> 01:05:41,500
where whatever doubt is generated

1334
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:43,580
about these models of knowledge,

1335
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:45,900
that will not be able to be generated anymore.

1336
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:48,540
We don't really know why.

1337
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:52,140
The completeness of the forms of non-real consciousness

1338
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:54,380
will emerge through the very necessity

1339
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:56,860
of their progression and their interrelations.

1340
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:59,700
The progression of one form of consciousness,

1341
01:05:59,700 --> 01:06:01,780
one conception of knowledge to another,

1342
01:06:01,780 --> 01:06:04,700
is going to be necessary, not contingent.

1343
01:06:04,700 --> 01:06:06,340
To make this comprehensible, it can

1344
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:08,620
be noted in general at the outset

1345
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:11,540
that the exposition of non-truthful consciousness

1346
01:06:11,540 --> 01:06:15,220
in its untruth is not merely a negative movement.

1347
01:06:15,220 --> 01:06:19,020
So Hegel now needs to explain why we transition

1348
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,660
from one shape of consciousness to the next.

1349
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:26,100
Now, rereading the introduction today,

1350
01:06:26,100 --> 01:06:29,740
I think this is, I came to the conclusion

1351
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,300
this text is not actually in the best order

1352
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:35,740
that it could be in, because only a little bit later

1353
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:39,180
will he explain exactly how consciousness

1354
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:41,220
undermines a shape of consciousness.

1355
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:42,660
But let's set that aside.

1356
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,620
Let's assume there's some notion of consciousness

1357
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:48,420
realizing that its conception of knowledge is wrong.

1358
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:52,700
Now we need to understand how it moves to the next one.

1359
01:06:52,700 --> 01:06:55,340
Now, I just want to emphasize one thing,

1360
01:06:55,340 --> 01:07:00,180
that this is a process, or this development,

1361
01:07:00,180 --> 01:07:02,500
is not about particular knowledge claims.

1362
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,700
We're not interested in particular knowledge

1363
01:07:04,740 --> 01:07:06,740
claims about particular objects.

1364
01:07:06,740 --> 01:07:09,220
It's at the level of a whole epistemology,

1365
01:07:09,220 --> 01:07:11,540
a whole conception of what knowledge is.

1366
01:07:11,540 --> 01:07:13,380
That's what's getting under it.

1367
01:07:13,380 --> 01:07:16,260
That's why doubt about that is the loss

1368
01:07:16,260 --> 01:07:18,340
of consciousness itself.

1369
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,620
If you find out that you thought you knew

1370
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:22,860
that South Dakota was the capital of,

1371
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:25,260
sorry, that Fargo was the capital of South Dakota,

1372
01:07:25,260 --> 01:07:27,180
and then you find out you're wrong,

1373
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,300
you don't lose yourself in that,

1374
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:29,700
unless you have way more invested

1375
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:32,900
in the geography of the Upper Midwest than you should.

1376
01:07:32,900 --> 01:07:34,740
Assuming that we're counting as the Dakotas

1377
01:07:34,740 --> 01:07:36,420
as part of the Midwest, which, okay,

1378
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:37,620
we can debate about that.

1379
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:41,500
You guys are probably not as invested

1380
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,860
in inter-Midwest rivalry as I am.

1381
01:07:45,820 --> 01:07:49,540
But that's how we learn from each other.

1382
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:53,260
Okay, so it's not merely a negative movement.

1383
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:56,300
So when consciousness realizes

1384
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:59,500
that its conception of knowledge is false,

1385
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,660
that isn't, it doesn't merely reject it.

1386
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:05,100
It's not just like not that.

1387
01:08:05,100 --> 01:08:07,980
However, only when taken as the nothing

1388
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:12,340
of that from which it is, from which it emerges,

1389
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:14,940
is the nothing, in fact, the true result.

1390
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:17,580
Thus, it is itself a determinate nothing,

1391
01:08:17,580 --> 01:08:19,420
and it has a content.

1392
01:08:19,420 --> 01:08:22,460
So when consciousness undermines

1393
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:25,220
some shape of consciousness, some conception of knowledge,

1394
01:08:25,220 --> 01:08:27,900
the result is not just pure,

1395
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,860
just the abandonment of knowing.

1396
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:31,660
Not just pure nothing.

1397
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:34,700
It's a specific or determinate negative nothing.

1398
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:37,980
It's the rejection of that previous shape,

1399
01:08:37,980 --> 01:08:40,580
which is itself its own shape.

1400
01:08:40,580 --> 01:08:44,820
So what Hegel needs to do is give us a principled reason

1401
01:08:44,820 --> 01:08:48,860
or a function for why one shape of consciousness

1402
01:08:48,860 --> 01:08:51,860
undermines itself and gives rise to the next.

1403
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:54,420
So there has to be, so to speak, a law of the series.

1404
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:56,260
So we have an account of where we start,

1405
01:08:56,260 --> 01:08:57,340
we have a kind of preliminary account

1406
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:58,500
of where we're gonna end,

1407
01:08:58,500 --> 01:09:02,260
but we also have an account of why we move

1408
01:09:02,260 --> 01:09:04,020
to the next one that we do move to.

1409
01:09:05,580 --> 01:09:07,580
By contrast, while the result is graphed,

1410
01:09:07,580 --> 01:09:10,820
as it is in its truth, as determinate negation,

1411
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,460
a new form has thereby immediately arisen.

1412
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:16,340
And in the negation, the transition is made

1413
01:09:16,340 --> 01:09:19,140
whereby the progression through the complete series

1414
01:09:19,140 --> 01:09:22,300
of shapes comes about on its own accord.

1415
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:24,540
So to say that a shape of consciousness

1416
01:09:24,540 --> 01:09:28,140
is a determinate negation is to say that it isn't something,

1417
01:09:28,140 --> 01:09:30,460
but it's not nothing in general.

1418
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:31,740
It's not just nothing.

1419
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:33,620
There's a specific thing it isn't,

1420
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:35,900
namely the previous shape of consciousness.

1421
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:38,420
In particular, it's a shape of consciousness

1422
01:09:38,420 --> 01:09:42,340
that arises in a principled way out of the failure

1423
01:09:42,340 --> 01:09:44,180
of the previous shape of consciousness.

1424
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,460
And Hegel is now going to give us an account

1425
01:09:46,460 --> 01:09:49,700
of exactly what that function is

1426
01:09:49,700 --> 01:09:52,060
that gets you from one shape of consciousness

1427
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:53,620
that fails to the next.

1428
01:09:54,860 --> 01:09:56,660
But again, rather than doing that,

1429
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:00,220
he then skips to the next topic, which is where it ends.

1430
01:10:00,220 --> 01:10:04,540
So what we need is an account of where we start,

1431
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:06,140
how we move, and where we end.

1432
01:10:06,140 --> 01:10:07,700
We've seen a little about where we start,

1433
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,620
a little about how we move,

1434
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:12,060
and now Hegel's gonna tell us more about how we end.

1435
01:10:12,060 --> 01:10:17,060
However, to knowing the goal is necessarily fixed

1436
01:10:17,260 --> 01:10:19,500
as the series of the progression

1437
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,020
is as necessarily fixed as the series of the progression,

1438
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,620
although you haven't really told us exactly

1439
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,380
what the series of the progression is, Hegel.

1440
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:26,420
The goal is the point.

1441
01:10:26,420 --> 01:10:28,780
The goal is the point at which knowing

1442
01:10:28,780 --> 01:10:32,340
no longer needs to go beyond its own self.

1443
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:35,540
Where knowing itself finds itself,

1444
01:10:35,540 --> 01:10:38,500
and where the concept corresponds to the object,

1445
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,780
and the object to the concept.

1446
01:10:40,780 --> 01:10:43,100
The progression towards this goal

1447
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:45,460
is thus also unrelenting,

1448
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:50,460
and at no earlier stage dissatisfaction to be felt.

1449
01:10:51,820 --> 01:10:54,420
So this process will end

1450
01:10:54,420 --> 01:10:57,700
when there's so little distinction

1451
01:10:57,700 --> 01:10:59,820
between subject and object,

1452
01:10:59,820 --> 01:11:02,820
between knowing and the object of knowing,

1453
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:06,580
that no skepticism about that shape of consciousness

1454
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:07,420
is possible.

1455
01:11:08,420 --> 01:11:12,140
So it's going to end only with such a complete coincidence

1456
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:14,180
of knowing at its object

1457
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:16,540
that the skeptical problem

1458
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:21,540
about these conceptions of knowledge cannot arise.

1459
01:11:22,540 --> 01:11:24,460
Now what exactly that is,

1460
01:11:24,460 --> 01:11:27,460
is only described at the end of the book.

1461
01:11:27,460 --> 01:11:29,700
It's very, very hard to understand.

1462
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:31,900
But that's where we're supposed to go.

1463
01:11:31,900 --> 01:11:35,700
Okay, now why can consciousness not stop

1464
01:11:35,700 --> 01:11:37,860
anywhere short of the entity?

1465
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:40,180
Consciousness therefore suffers this violence

1466
01:11:40,180 --> 01:11:41,780
at its own hands,

1467
01:11:41,780 --> 01:11:45,820
and brings to ruin its own restricted satisfaction.

1468
01:11:45,820 --> 01:11:49,460
So the failure of these forms of consciousness,

1469
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:50,500
these shapes of consciousness,

1470
01:11:50,660 --> 01:11:51,980
these conceptions of knowledge,

1471
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:53,540
is not something external.

1472
01:11:54,380 --> 01:11:57,180
Consciousness itself realizes

1473
01:11:57,180 --> 01:11:59,420
that its conception of knowledge is wrong.

1474
01:11:59,420 --> 01:12:00,860
It does it to itself.

1475
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:03,860
With the feeling of this violence,

1476
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:07,020
anxiety over the truth might well withdraw

1477
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:10,540
and strive to hold onto what it is in danger of losing.

1478
01:12:10,540 --> 01:12:13,260
But this anxiety can find no rest.

1479
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:16,260
Even if it wants to remain in thoughtless indolence,

1480
01:12:16,260 --> 01:12:18,780
thought spoils the thoughtlessness,

1481
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:21,740
and its unrest disturbs the indolence.

1482
01:12:21,740 --> 01:12:24,860
So as Hegel says on the next page,

1483
01:12:27,700 --> 01:12:29,140
where can I never find this?

1484
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:40,300
I know I have this underlined.

1485
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,420
Okay, as he says in the next couple of pages,

1486
01:12:42,420 --> 01:12:43,620
which we will come to,

1487
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:48,620
it is an issue for consciousness

1488
01:12:50,220 --> 01:12:51,980
whether or not its knowing of the object

1489
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:53,860
corresponds to the object, that's 56.

1490
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:56,540
So consciousness, it cannot be indifferent

1491
01:12:56,540 --> 01:12:59,220
to consciousness whether it knows.

1492
01:12:59,220 --> 01:13:03,940
So consciousness purports to no objects.

1493
01:13:03,940 --> 01:13:07,220
It has a conception of what knowledge is.

1494
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:12,220
And Hegel says it is not indifferent to consciousness.

1495
01:13:12,380 --> 01:13:15,060
Consciousness can't just not care

1496
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:18,340
about whether what it thinks knowing is, is knowing.

1497
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:23,940
Now, you might think, well,

1498
01:13:23,940 --> 01:13:27,180
knowledge is just one thing in life.

1499
01:13:27,180 --> 01:13:29,100
Like I have a lot of family members

1500
01:13:29,100 --> 01:13:31,860
who don't care that much about what knowledge is.

1501
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:35,500
They do, only philosophers are so,

1502
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:39,900
only a philosopher could say consciousness

1503
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,260
with feeling of this violence,

1504
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:43,340
anxiety over the truth might well withdraw

1505
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:45,260
and strive to hold on to what is in danger of losing.

1506
01:13:45,260 --> 01:13:47,220
This anxiety can find no rest.

1507
01:13:47,220 --> 01:13:48,980
Even if it wants to remain in thoughtless indolence,

1508
01:13:48,980 --> 01:13:50,420
thought spoils the thoughtlessness

1509
01:13:50,420 --> 01:13:52,820
that its unrest disturbs the indolence.

1510
01:13:52,820 --> 01:13:56,780
A lot of people, their anxiety does find a rest.

1511
01:13:56,780 --> 01:13:59,780
They don't, they wanna remain in thoughtless indolence

1512
01:13:59,780 --> 01:14:02,860
and thought doesn't spoil their thoughtlessness

1513
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:05,060
and unrest does not disturb their indolence.

1514
01:14:05,060 --> 01:14:07,940
They're very happy to not think or not know.

1515
01:14:07,940 --> 01:14:12,300
So this is not supposed to be a psychological claim

1516
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:15,020
about particular conscious subjects.

1517
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:17,620
So whatever Hegel's claim is here,

1518
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:20,740
is not supposed to be contrary to

1519
01:14:20,740 --> 01:14:22,980
and therefore not refutable to psychological claims

1520
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:24,500
about particular human beings.

1521
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:28,180
As we'll see over the course of the phenomenology

1522
01:14:28,180 --> 01:14:29,940
or if we were to read the whole phenomenology

1523
01:14:29,940 --> 01:14:31,860
as we would see, knowledge,

1524
01:14:31,860 --> 01:14:35,140
Hegel thinks of as a very, very general phenomenon.

1525
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:37,860
It's sort of ubiquitous or structural

1526
01:14:38,660 --> 01:14:39,500
in human life.

1527
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:44,100
So doing something, action is also a kind of knowledge.

1528
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:47,740
It's a representation of the object

1529
01:14:47,740 --> 01:14:50,460
as being in conformity with your representation of it,

1530
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,700
as being choice worthy.

1531
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:55,820
So there's no way of being indifferent to knowledge.

1532
01:14:55,820 --> 01:15:00,820
Any acting, any willing, any belief about the world

1533
01:15:03,380 --> 01:15:06,820
is making a claim to knowledge.

1534
01:15:06,820 --> 01:15:10,500
So notice I haven't said that knowledge here

1535
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,380
is this thing that analytic philosophers

1536
01:15:12,380 --> 01:15:14,620
are kind of pointlessly obsessed with.

1537
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:15,660
S knows that P.

1538
01:15:21,660 --> 01:15:25,460
This is a much more general structure.

1539
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:28,340
This is the structure of your relationship with the world.

1540
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:31,060
This you might not care about.

1541
01:15:31,060 --> 01:15:32,460
You probably shouldn't care about it.

1542
01:15:32,460 --> 01:15:34,340
Stop caring about it.

1543
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:38,700
This you walk around life

1544
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:41,220
carrying with you a conception of this.

1545
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:43,340
It cannot be indifferent to you

1546
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:45,660
whether the world does actually relate to you

1547
01:15:45,660 --> 01:15:48,340
the way you conceive it as related to you.

1548
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:51,940
Okay, a little bit further and then we'll take a break.

1549
01:15:51,940 --> 01:15:55,180
Just as these preliminary and general remarks

1550
01:15:55,180 --> 01:15:57,700
about the manner and the necessity of the progression

1551
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:02,060
have been made, so too it might be useful to recall something

1552
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:04,740
about the method of the way it is carried out.

1553
01:16:04,740 --> 01:16:07,380
So Hegel is now gonna tell us more about

1554
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:10,140
how consciousness undermines

1555
01:16:10,140 --> 01:16:15,140
its own conception of knowledge or the law of the series.

1556
01:16:16,620 --> 01:16:17,900
Sorry, not the law of the series.

1557
01:16:17,900 --> 01:16:19,740
The law of the series is how we go from

1558
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:21,660
shape of consciousness and the shape of consciousness

1559
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:24,740
and plus one, but why we have to move on.

1560
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:26,980
Why one shape of consciousness fails.

1561
01:16:28,380 --> 01:16:30,380
Just as these preliminary and general remarks

1562
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:31,500
about the manner and the necessity

1563
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,740
of the progression have been made,

1564
01:16:32,740 --> 01:16:34,220
so too it might be useful to recall something

1565
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,900
about the method of the way it is carried out.

1566
01:16:35,900 --> 01:16:39,340
This exposition represented as the conduct of science

1567
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:41,700
in relation to knowing as it appears

1568
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:44,220
and represented as the investigation and testing

1569
01:16:44,220 --> 01:16:47,140
of the reality of cognition seems incapable

1570
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:50,140
of taking place without some kind of presupposition

1571
01:16:50,140 --> 01:16:52,780
with underlies it as a stem.

1572
01:16:52,780 --> 01:16:56,420
So it looks like, once again, it appears.

1573
01:16:56,420 --> 01:16:59,500
That means he's suggesting this is something you might think

1574
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:00,980
he's ultimately gonna undermine it.

1575
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:02,500
You might think that what we need to do

1576
01:17:02,500 --> 01:17:04,820
is have a standard of what knowing is

1577
01:17:04,820 --> 01:17:06,780
and then investigate each shape of consciousness

1578
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:08,700
and say, that doesn't meet the standard.

1579
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:10,500
That's not what knowing is.

1580
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:13,220
For the testing consists in the application

1581
01:17:13,220 --> 01:17:17,140
of an accepted standard and in the resulting equality

1582
01:17:17,140 --> 01:17:22,020
or inequality between the standard and what is tested

1583
01:17:22,020 --> 01:17:25,220
lays the decision as to what is tested

1584
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:27,540
is correct or incorrect.

1585
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:30,500
The standard, likewise, science itself,

1586
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,660
if science were to be the standard,

1587
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:35,220
is thereby accepted as the essence or as the in itself.

1588
01:17:35,220 --> 01:17:37,860
Ignore, we'll come back to essence and in itself.

1589
01:17:37,860 --> 01:17:39,340
But here, at the point where science

1590
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:40,900
first comes on the scene,

1591
01:17:40,900 --> 01:17:43,540
where someone makes a claim to scientific knowledge,

1592
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:45,620
neither science itself nor anything else

1593
01:17:45,620 --> 01:17:48,980
has justified itself as the essence or as the in itself.

1594
01:17:48,980 --> 01:17:51,340
And without something like that taking place,

1595
01:17:51,340 --> 01:17:54,940
it seems that no examination could take place at all.

1596
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:57,360
So there's this problem.

1597
01:17:57,480 --> 01:18:00,000
It looks like we need to apply a standard.

1598
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:01,840
Where does the standard come from?

1599
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:04,240
One can have a more determinant grasp of this contradiction

1600
01:18:04,240 --> 01:18:06,000
and the removal of the contradiction.

1601
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,280
If, first of all, one is reminded

1602
01:18:07,280 --> 01:18:09,800
of the abstract determinations of knowing and truth

1603
01:18:09,800 --> 01:18:12,840
as they come before consciousness.

1604
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:16,600
Okay, so what Hegel is doing in 81

1605
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:20,280
is he's making a reference

1606
01:18:20,280 --> 01:18:24,040
to something called the dilemma of the criterion.

1607
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:26,200
I'm going to erase Hegel's system.

1608
01:18:28,360 --> 01:18:29,960
It's actually very Hegelian.

1609
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:34,120
When we get into Hegel's logic,

1610
01:18:34,120 --> 01:18:35,840
there's going to be a lot of erasure.

1611
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:38,000
That's going to be like a main metaphor.

1612
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,560
Hegel's a great philosopher to teach on the blackboard.

1613
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,400
Okay.

1614
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:46,520
The dilemma of the criterion

1615
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:53,040
comes from a work of ancient philosophy

1616
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,040
by Sextus empiricus.

1617
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,920
Called outlines of purism.

1618
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:06,280
Here's the basic idea.

1619
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:12,000
Or this is how Hegel is thinking of the idea in Sextus.

1620
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,840
That's what matters for our purposes.

1621
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,880
Someone makes a claim to knowledge.

1622
01:19:17,880 --> 01:19:20,100
We have to have a standard

1623
01:19:20,100 --> 01:19:22,480
for whether that counts as knowledge or not.

1624
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,760
Whether that's a valid knowledge group.

1625
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:26,440
Whether that person in fact knows what they claim to know.

1626
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,160
Now either that standard

1627
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:31,920
is that person's own conception of knowledge.

1628
01:19:32,780 --> 01:19:34,080
In which case it's circular.

1629
01:19:35,800 --> 01:19:36,640
Very easy.

1630
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:38,440
Now, totally useless.

1631
01:19:38,440 --> 01:19:41,280
Everyone's conception of knowledge agrees with itself,

1632
01:19:41,280 --> 01:19:44,160
so everyone meets their own standard.

1633
01:19:44,160 --> 01:19:47,040
Or the standard has to be external

1634
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:48,140
to their conception of knowledge.

1635
01:19:48,140 --> 01:19:49,640
But then it's question-making.

1636
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:53,520
So, what Hegel is doing

1637
01:19:53,960 --> 01:19:56,640
is raising this as a problem for his own project.

1638
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,120
What we don't want to do

1639
01:19:59,120 --> 01:20:02,560
is apply external standards or criterions.

1640
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:03,400
Criteria.

1641
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,280
We'll also call it the dilemma of the standard.

1642
01:20:09,280 --> 01:20:10,120
Maschab.

1643
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:17,040
So, what he's going to do is develop a way

1644
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,680
of how consciousness can undermine

1645
01:20:19,680 --> 01:20:21,440
its own conception of knowledge

1646
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:24,120
that doesn't run into the dilemma of the criteria.

1647
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,360
One can have a more determinate grasp of this contradiction

1648
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:32,400
and the removal of the contradiction

1649
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,640
if first of all, one is reminded

1650
01:20:34,640 --> 01:20:37,600
of the abstract determinations of knowing their truth

1651
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,520
as they come before consciousness.

1652
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,040
Okay, abstract determinations means

1653
01:20:42,040 --> 01:20:44,000
these are sort of,

1654
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,080
Hegel's now going to give us a very abstract model

1655
01:20:47,080 --> 01:20:49,300
of what consciousness acknowledges.

1656
01:20:49,300 --> 01:20:51,620
Now, if we were reading the whole phenomenology,

1657
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:53,780
one question would be whether this model

1658
01:20:53,780 --> 01:20:56,260
in the introduction actually applies to the whole book.

1659
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:57,940
I don't think it does,

1660
01:20:57,940 --> 01:21:00,300
but I think it's fine for our purposes

1661
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:01,660
because it applies to the parts of the book

1662
01:21:01,660 --> 01:21:02,820
that we're going to read.

1663
01:21:02,820 --> 01:21:06,940
So, consciousness distinguishes something from itself

1664
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:09,660
while at the same time it relates itself to it.

1665
01:21:09,660 --> 01:21:14,140
Okay, so I'm going to remove the term subject and object

1666
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:17,360
because those are not yet Hegel's terms.

1667
01:21:19,300 --> 01:21:23,540
So we have consciousness.

1668
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:30,980
It has a relation to something distinct from itself

1669
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:34,580
and it also distinguishes itself from it.

1670
01:21:34,580 --> 01:21:36,500
Or, as it is expressed,

1671
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:39,660
the something is something for consciousness.

1672
01:21:43,540 --> 01:21:46,940
This is for consciousness.

1673
01:21:47,020 --> 01:21:49,860
Something consciousness is of.

1674
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:53,380
This something is something for consciousness

1675
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:55,900
and the determinate aspect of this relating

1676
01:21:55,900 --> 01:21:59,040
or of the being of something for a consciousness is known.

1677
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:05,300
So knowing is a relation of consciousness to the object.

1678
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:09,620
In this direction, this object is for consciousness.

1679
01:22:09,620 --> 01:22:12,820
In this direction, consciousness knows this object.

1680
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:15,740
However, we distinguish the being for another

1681
01:22:15,740 --> 01:22:17,380
from being in itself.

1682
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:28,820
That which is related to knowing

1683
01:22:28,820 --> 01:22:31,180
is just as much distinguished from knowing

1684
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:35,340
and is positive as being also external to this relation.

1685
01:22:35,340 --> 01:22:40,100
The aspect of this in itself is called truth.

1686
01:22:40,100 --> 01:22:43,280
So the aspect of being in itself

1687
01:22:43,280 --> 01:22:48,280
that it can be if outstanding in this relationship is truth.

1688
01:22:48,480 --> 01:22:49,320
Now what does that mean?

1689
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:52,640
What it means is this is a super abstract structural

1690
01:22:52,640 --> 01:22:55,000
description of consciousness and knowledge.

1691
01:22:55,000 --> 01:22:58,580
Consciousness distinguishes itself from something,

1692
01:22:58,580 --> 01:23:00,240
the object of consciousness,

1693
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:03,240
but also relates itself to knowing.

1694
01:23:03,240 --> 01:23:04,320
And remember, knowing here

1695
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,400
is not necessarily propositional knowledge.

1696
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:07,400
Don't worry about that.

1697
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,080
It could be acquaintance, perceiving something.

1698
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:13,080
That's a kind of note, willing something.

1699
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:17,060
But what it knows has some kind of independence

1700
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:18,920
of its relationship to it.

1701
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:22,040
That is to say that being,

1702
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:25,600
what it knows is not identical to its knowledge.

1703
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:27,120
Now that doesn't mean

1704
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,320
that this thing is completely independent of this.

1705
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:35,160
It means that it isn't simply identical to this.

1706
01:23:35,160 --> 01:23:38,020
It means that if we got rid of this entirely,

1707
01:23:38,020 --> 01:23:40,600
we would have a completely different model.

1708
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,960
Okay, that's all Hegel is assuming.

1709
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:45,540
Now, Rota's truth here does not mean P.

1710
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:53,280
analytic philosophy is very into P's and Q's and R's.

1711
01:23:53,280 --> 01:23:56,060
It is, as I like to call it, philosophy in the key of P.

1712
01:23:57,840 --> 01:24:00,520
Hegel is not a philosopher in the key of P.

1713
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:03,600
As we'll see over the course of this semester,

1714
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:06,640
I think it's actually super crucial to understanding Hegel

1715
01:24:06,640 --> 01:24:09,440
that Hegel cannot be put in the form of P.

1716
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,480
There is no P, there's no value of P,

1717
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:13,480
especially Hegel's view is P.

1718
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:14,880
Yes.

1719
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,640
Knowing determines consciousness

1720
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:21,080
or consciousness determines knowing.

1721
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,600
Consciousness, for now we're assuming

1722
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:26,020
that knowing is the relationship

1723
01:24:26,020 --> 01:24:28,080
of consciousness to the object.

1724
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:31,240
Knowing is a relation that consciousness has to the object.

1725
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,960
We only call something consciousness right now

1726
01:24:33,960 --> 01:24:36,200
insofar as it stands in a knowing relation

1727
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:38,800
to the object, to the in itself.

1728
01:24:38,840 --> 01:24:43,640
Okay, skip a paragraph, but the nature of the object

1729
01:24:43,640 --> 01:24:47,960
which we are investigating goes beyond this division

1730
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:51,640
or to this semblance of division and presupposition.

1731
01:24:51,640 --> 01:24:54,320
So it looks like we have a distinction

1732
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:58,600
between consciousness and our conception of consciousness.

1733
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,240
This thing on the blackboard is a conception of consciousness.

1734
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:07,800
But the nature of this object is that distinction

1735
01:25:08,880 --> 01:25:13,880
between this and the whole thing is overcome.

1736
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:20,800
Consciousness in its own self provides its own standard

1737
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:24,320
and the investigation will therefore be a comparison

1738
01:25:24,320 --> 01:25:28,520
of itself, of it with itself, for the difference

1739
01:25:28,520 --> 01:25:33,000
which has just been made falls within consciousness.

1740
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:36,320
That is to say, consciousness itself

1741
01:25:37,320 --> 01:25:38,880
has a conception of this.

1742
01:25:44,820 --> 01:25:48,280
So this difference between consciousness

1743
01:25:48,280 --> 01:25:51,640
and being in itself falls within consciousness

1744
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:54,360
because consciousness is consciousness.

1745
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,380
We can also know if I was a better drawer,

1746
01:25:56,380 --> 01:25:59,320
I could have put this thought bubble inside consciousness.

1747
01:25:59,320 --> 01:26:00,520
Hard to draw with chalk.

1748
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:06,200
Consciousness is its own self, provides its own standard.

1749
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,560
So consciousness brings with it a standard

1750
01:26:08,560 --> 01:26:09,720
of what knowledge is.

1751
01:26:11,800 --> 01:26:15,160
Therefore, skipping again a few sentences,

1752
01:26:15,160 --> 01:26:19,120
therefore in what consciousness declares within itself

1753
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:23,120
to be the in itself or the true, we have the standard

1754
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:26,920
which consciousness itself sets up to measure its known.

1755
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:31,060
So consciousness has a standard, it has to know this.

1756
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,400
That sets a standard.

1757
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:37,600
If we designate knowing as the concept,

1758
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:42,140
but designate the essence or the true over here

1759
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:45,900
as what is or the object, then the examining consists

1760
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:48,860
in whether the concept corresponds to the object.

1761
01:26:48,860 --> 01:26:52,840
Does this correspond to that?

1762
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:56,500
Is this a way of knowingly relating to that?

1763
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,920
Well remember, what relation knowing is also,

1764
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:01,680
it's up to consciousness to say.

1765
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:03,560
So don't assume that it's true justified belief

1766
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:04,600
or whatever.

1767
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:06,160
Let me just go a little bit further.

1768
01:27:06,160 --> 01:27:08,540
Oh, 84.

1769
01:27:10,280 --> 01:27:11,560
End of 84.

1770
01:27:16,120 --> 01:27:19,640
What is essential throughout the whole investigation

1771
01:27:19,640 --> 01:27:22,440
is to hold fast to this, that both of these moments,

1772
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:25,720
concept and object, being for another,

1773
01:27:25,720 --> 01:27:27,800
being for consciousness and being in itself,

1774
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:31,320
themselves fall within the knowing that we are investigating.

1775
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,400
They fall within consciousness.

1776
01:27:33,400 --> 01:27:35,280
They fall within consciousness's conception

1777
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:36,760
of itself as known.

1778
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:39,960
And that we thus do not need to bring standards with us

1779
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:43,220
and in the investigation to apply our ideas and thoughts.

1780
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:45,120
But now you might think, okay,

1781
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:47,660
isn't Hegel running into one horn

1782
01:27:47,660 --> 01:27:49,480
of the dilemma of the criterion?

1783
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,780
Every conception of knowing is just going to agree

1784
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:53,580
with its own standard.

1785
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:55,680
No, Hegel's about target.

1786
01:27:55,680 --> 01:27:57,920
That actually shapes of consciousness in general

1787
01:27:57,920 --> 01:28:00,120
do not agree with their own standard.

1788
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:02,200
However, from this aspect,

1789
01:28:02,200 --> 01:28:05,620
not only will it be superfluous for us to add anything,

1790
01:28:05,620 --> 01:28:07,460
and not only because concept and object,

1791
01:28:07,460 --> 01:28:08,920
the standard and what is to be examined

1792
01:28:08,920 --> 01:28:11,580
are present in consciousness itself,

1793
01:28:11,580 --> 01:28:16,580
the only thing that remains is for us to purely look on.

1794
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:19,360
So now this is a super important aspect

1795
01:28:19,360 --> 01:28:21,000
of the way Hegel does philosophy.

1796
01:28:21,000 --> 01:28:22,440
And this is the first instance of it

1797
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:24,360
that we've seen in the phenomenology.

1798
01:28:24,360 --> 01:28:27,780
Hegel's philosophy is supposed to always be imminent.

1799
01:28:28,780 --> 01:28:33,780
That means there's some subject matter

1800
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,620
and the further development of the claims

1801
01:28:38,620 --> 01:28:41,300
about that subject matter in Hegel's philosophy

1802
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:43,540
arise from the subject matter itself.

1803
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:48,160
That means at no point in the phenomenology

1804
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:52,000
can Hegel say, look, it's plausible that this,

1805
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:55,320
or I think that, or in my view this,

1806
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:58,520
everything has to come out of consciousness itself.

1807
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:00,080
And since the beginning of the phenomenology

1808
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,280
is natural consciousness,

1809
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:03,720
it has to arise from natural consciousness itself.

1810
01:29:03,720 --> 01:29:05,400
So what we do in the phenomenology

1811
01:29:05,400 --> 01:29:08,440
is we just observe natural consciousness

1812
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:12,180
developing itself through these shapes of consciousness

1813
01:29:12,180 --> 01:29:13,480
to absolute knowing.

1814
01:29:15,560 --> 01:29:19,880
It is consciousness of what to it is the true.

1815
01:29:19,880 --> 01:29:21,960
So it's consciousness of this

1816
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:26,220
as well as consciousness of its knowing of the truth.

1817
01:29:26,220 --> 01:29:28,540
So it's conscious not only of this,

1818
01:29:28,540 --> 01:29:30,360
but of this whole thing.

1819
01:29:30,360 --> 01:29:32,140
So it's object consciousness,

1820
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:35,720
but also consciousness of itself as knowing

1821
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:38,320
under a particular description of what knowing is.

1822
01:29:39,920 --> 01:29:41,880
It is an issue for that consciousness

1823
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,760
whether or not it's knowing of the object

1824
01:29:43,760 --> 01:29:45,760
corresponds to the object.

1825
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,160
So consciousness cannot be indifferent

1826
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:50,420
to whether this agrees with that.

1827
01:29:51,420 --> 01:29:53,940
Because it itself has supplied the criteria.

1828
01:29:55,540 --> 01:30:00,100
Okay, so we're gonna somehow argue

1829
01:30:00,100 --> 01:30:02,820
that various shapes of consciousness

1830
01:30:02,820 --> 01:30:05,020
fail their own criteria.

1831
01:30:05,020 --> 01:30:08,460
That they think this is a knowing of that,

1832
01:30:08,460 --> 01:30:10,700
but this as they themselves conceive it

1833
01:30:10,700 --> 01:30:12,820
is not a knowing of that.

1834
01:30:12,820 --> 01:30:15,740
Okay, we'll take one a little bit

1835
01:30:15,740 --> 01:30:16,840
and then we'll take a break

1836
01:30:16,840 --> 01:30:18,940
and then we'll read the last three paragraphs

1837
01:30:18,940 --> 01:30:19,780
really carefully.

1838
01:30:21,140 --> 01:30:23,380
This dialectical movement.

1839
01:30:23,380 --> 01:30:25,900
Ah, okay, so you've been wondering,

1840
01:30:25,900 --> 01:30:26,860
you're taking a Hegel class

1841
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:28,100
and he's been doing it for two hours.

1842
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:29,500
He hasn't said the word dialectic yet.

1843
01:30:29,500 --> 01:30:30,340
Okay.

1844
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:33,540
Dialectic.

1845
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:38,700
Hegel.

1846
01:30:41,660 --> 01:30:45,940
In some sense, all of Hegel's philosophy

1847
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:48,460
works by something called the dialectic

1848
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:50,100
or dialectical progression.

1849
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:53,540
I think the structure of the dialectic

1850
01:30:53,540 --> 01:30:55,860
in phenomenology is different

1851
01:30:55,860 --> 01:30:58,980
than the structure of the dialectic in the larger.

1852
01:30:58,980 --> 01:31:00,760
I don't understand the dialectic

1853
01:31:00,760 --> 01:31:01,740
of the philosophy of nature

1854
01:31:01,740 --> 01:31:03,220
or really the philosophy of spirit either,

1855
01:31:03,220 --> 01:31:04,140
but I really don't understand

1856
01:31:04,140 --> 01:31:05,420
the dialectic philosophy of nature.

1857
01:31:05,420 --> 01:31:07,620
No one really understands the dialectic philosophy of nature.

1858
01:31:07,620 --> 01:31:10,340
But what does Hegel mean by the word dialectic?

1859
01:31:11,860 --> 01:31:14,260
There's two historical sources that are relevant.

1860
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:16,980
One, in ancient philosophy,

1861
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:19,740
dialectic, very simply put,

1862
01:31:19,740 --> 01:31:23,480
is the science of refuting what other people say.

1863
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:26,740
So it's a negative logical art

1864
01:31:26,740 --> 01:31:27,900
where you say something

1865
01:31:27,900 --> 01:31:29,460
and I reduce you to absurdity.

1866
01:31:30,900 --> 01:31:35,500
In Kant, there's something called the transcendental dialect.

1867
01:31:37,180 --> 01:31:40,260
Now the transcendental dialectic actually has three parts,

1868
01:31:40,260 --> 01:31:44,380
but Hegel always associates the dialectic with the antinomies.

1869
01:31:44,380 --> 01:31:47,860
The idea of the antinomies of pure reason

1870
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:51,740
in the first critique is that reason itself

1871
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,580
is subject to a dialectic.

1872
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:57,020
So it's not that someone comes along and refutes reason,

1873
01:31:57,020 --> 01:31:59,180
reason refutes itself.

1874
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:03,560
It refutes itself and so far as it assumes

1875
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:06,460
that objects in space and time are things in themselves

1876
01:32:07,420 --> 01:32:09,860
because it forms this conception

1877
01:32:09,860 --> 01:32:12,300
of something called the unconditioned.

1878
01:32:12,340 --> 01:32:14,860
So you take something, you take its conditions

1879
01:32:14,860 --> 01:32:17,900
and then you take the complete sequence of its conditions.

1880
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:22,660
And it has a proof that that sequence of conditions

1881
01:32:22,660 --> 01:32:25,300
terminates in an unconditioned first condition

1882
01:32:25,300 --> 01:32:27,640
and it has a proof that it cannot terminate,

1883
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,020
that it goes on infinitely.

1884
01:32:29,020 --> 01:32:30,340
That's a contradiction.

1885
01:32:30,340 --> 01:32:33,020
And so the resolution to that contradiction, Kant thinks,

1886
01:32:33,020 --> 01:32:34,780
is to recognize that objects in space and time

1887
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:37,220
are appearances and so there is no such thing

1888
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:39,740
as the unconditioned totality of their conditions.

1889
01:32:39,740 --> 01:32:40,940
If you haven't taken 3.14,

1890
01:32:40,940 --> 01:32:42,980
that wouldn't really make a lot of sense to you,

1891
01:32:42,980 --> 01:32:44,580
but you should all just take 3.14.

1892
01:32:44,580 --> 01:32:46,840
Okay, who's taking 3.14?

1893
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:49,780
Good, the rest of you should model yourselves

1894
01:32:49,780 --> 01:32:51,300
on those who are taking 3.14.

1895
01:32:53,300 --> 01:32:56,540
So what Hegel means by a dialectic

1896
01:32:56,540 --> 01:32:59,000
is as in ancient philosophy,

1897
01:33:00,160 --> 01:33:04,880
refutation is a negative, it's negative.

1898
01:33:05,940 --> 01:33:10,260
But as with Kant, it's not refutation by some other person.

1899
01:33:11,940 --> 01:33:15,220
It's not external refutation, it's self-refutation.

1900
01:33:15,220 --> 01:33:18,140
It's the self-refutation here in the phenomenology

1901
01:33:18,140 --> 01:33:19,940
of shapes of consciousness,

1902
01:33:19,940 --> 01:33:22,380
of conceptions of what knowledge is.

1903
01:33:22,380 --> 01:33:27,340
The difference between both ancient dialectic,

1904
01:33:27,340 --> 01:33:29,580
Kantian dialectic and Hegelian dialectic

1905
01:33:29,580 --> 01:33:33,020
is as we saw earlier, Hegel thinks that dialectic

1906
01:33:33,020 --> 01:33:35,180
is not purely negative.

1907
01:33:35,180 --> 01:33:37,500
It's productive or positive.

1908
01:33:37,620 --> 01:33:39,820
So when we dialectically undermine

1909
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:41,260
the shape of consciousness,

1910
01:33:41,260 --> 01:33:44,460
we don't go, oh fuck, we have a contradiction.

1911
01:33:44,460 --> 01:33:47,180
That generates positive content.

1912
01:33:48,580 --> 01:33:50,940
What Hegel calls the determinant negation

1913
01:33:50,940 --> 01:33:52,500
of the refuted shape of consciousness,

1914
01:33:52,500 --> 01:33:55,660
which is the successor shape of consciousness,

1915
01:33:55,660 --> 01:33:59,540
which in a principled fashion, non-orbitarily,

1916
01:33:59,540 --> 01:34:02,360
attempts to resolve the contradiction

1917
01:34:02,360 --> 01:34:04,620
in the earlier shape of consciousness.

1918
01:34:04,620 --> 01:34:05,660
So no, that's why.

1919
01:34:05,660 --> 01:34:08,620
So that means the phenomenology of spirit

1920
01:34:08,620 --> 01:34:11,520
is the inner dialectic of knowing.

1921
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,660
But it's not just refutation, it's also position.

1922
01:34:14,660 --> 01:34:16,120
It's also positive.

1923
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:18,660
The self-refutation of one shape of consciousness

1924
01:34:18,660 --> 01:34:21,180
generates the next shape of consciousness.

1925
01:34:21,180 --> 01:34:23,500
And that's why it's important

1926
01:34:23,500 --> 01:34:26,260
that Hegel give us a principled function

1927
01:34:26,260 --> 01:34:28,140
from shape of consciousness n

1928
01:34:28,140 --> 01:34:30,340
to shape of consciousness n plus one.

1929
01:34:30,340 --> 01:34:33,020
Because otherwise, the imminence

1930
01:34:33,020 --> 01:34:36,460
of the phenomenology of spirit would be wrecked.

1931
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:39,460
That is to say, we would have to supply it.

1932
01:34:39,460 --> 01:34:40,980
We'd be like, what's a reasonable

1933
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:42,220
next shape of consciousness?

1934
01:34:42,220 --> 01:34:44,180
Well, this seems good.

1935
01:34:44,180 --> 01:34:47,940
And it would no longer be consciousness developing itself.

1936
01:34:47,940 --> 01:34:50,860
And so in a certain way, it would fall a foul

1937
01:34:50,860 --> 01:34:52,980
of the problem of the criterion.

1938
01:34:52,980 --> 01:34:56,060
Something external to consciousness

1939
01:34:56,060 --> 01:34:59,060
would be telling it what its next standard should be.

1940
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:01,420
And consciousness would not be rationally obliged

1941
01:35:01,420 --> 01:35:02,260
to accept that.

1942
01:35:03,220 --> 01:35:08,220
So we require an in-principle account

1943
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,220
of how one shape of consciousness

1944
01:35:11,220 --> 01:35:14,260
gives rise to the next shape of consciousness.

1945
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:19,260
Okay, why don't we take a 10-minute break

1946
01:35:20,620 --> 01:35:22,940
and come back at 54 past?

1947
01:35:22,940 --> 01:35:24,900
If you are auditing this class

1948
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:27,620
and you have not yet been added to Quirkus,

1949
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:28,860
please come speak to me

1950
01:35:28,860 --> 01:35:31,100
and I will add you to Quirkus right now.

1951
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:38,620
Hello.

1952
01:35:38,620 --> 01:35:39,460
Can I add it?

1953
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:40,620
Yes, you just.

1954
01:35:44,060 --> 01:35:45,980
It makes me so warm.

1955
01:35:45,980 --> 01:35:46,820
Dial in.
