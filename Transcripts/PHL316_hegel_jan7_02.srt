1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
to figure out whether you know that.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,760
What criterion of knowledge should we apply?

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,720
Well, one thing we could do is apply

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,840
your own criteria of knowledge.

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,340
Maybe your criteria of knowledge is faith.

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,880
Let's say it's specifically Christian faith.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,240
Okay, your knowledge claim meets that criterion.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,040
But that was a little easy.

9
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:27,040
Anyone's knowledge claim is gonna meet their own criterion,

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,560
you would normally think.

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,920
So that surely can't be sufficient for knowledge.

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,180
Here's another possibility.

13
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,280
I'll apply another criterion, an external criterion.

14
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,760
Knowledge is the deliverance of natural science.

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,760
Natural science doesn't say anything about God,

16
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,020
says Richard Dawkins.

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,800
So therefore you don't know that God exists.

18
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,680
That was also a little easy.

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,880
It seemed totally questionable.

20
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,960
So that's the glum of the criteria.

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,720
Hegel's idea is that the first horn of the dilemma

22
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,760
isn't actually so easy.

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,800
Because in fact, these criteria,

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,440
these conceptions of knowledge

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,600
that natural consciousness generates

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,180
are typically incoherence of their object.

27
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,840
Now, you might ask, so one question you might have is,

28
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,760
well, okay, but I can think of some conception of knowledge

29
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,880
that isn't in the phenomenology of spirit that's coherent.

30
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,120
But that isn't, so to speak,

31
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,800
that isn't sort of argumentatively relevant

32
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,560
to the phenomenology of spirit.

33
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,840
The argument of phenomenology of spirit is if you just

34
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,880
start out with the most primitive thing from itself,

35
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:36,240
that will develop into knowledge that's so certain

36
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,840
that no skeptical doubt about it can be raised.

37
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,680
Okay, yeah, just one, and then we'll come on.

38
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:47,680
So, if consciousness alters the standard of knowing,

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,200
and then when the standard of knowing changes,

40
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,360
it seems that so does the object that it knows.

41
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,240
So that, how is there ever a one-on-one mapping

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,160
of the object and the standard of knowing?

43
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,360
How do they ever meet?

44
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,640
When you change the object of knowing,

45
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,120
you also change the knowledge

46
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,000
that you need to know the object.

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
And that's exactly what we're about to talk about.

48
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,200
Paragraph 87, page 57.

49
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,400
Okay, so for some reason that I actually don't really know,

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,120
the phenomenology is always cited by paragraph numbers.

51
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:25,120
So, in your papers, please cite it by paragraph number.

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
And just because I want to drill into your mind,

53
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,120
the fact that we are reading this at secondhand,

54
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,240
you're reading it through translation,

55
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,480
cite the marginal page numbers always,

56
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,160
whenever they're given any of our translations.

57
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,440
Because that's the sort of speak real thing.

58
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:48,040
The page in Pinkert's translation is just,

59
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,800
the page in what Terry Pinkert is telling you,

60
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,640
they will say.

61
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
In this exposition of the course of experience,

62
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,800
there is a moment through which the exposition

63
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,120
seems not to correspond

64
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,040
with what is ordinarily understood by experience.

65
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,160
Okay, let me just back up.

66
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,280
I skipped something.

67
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,760
This dialectical movement,

68
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:13,320
which consciousness practices in its own self,

69
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,120
this is 86,

70
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,000
insofar as for consciousness,

71
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,200
the new true object arises out of this movement

72
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,800
is properly what is called experience.

73
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,480
So Hegel's technical notion of experience

74
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:28,840
is not when you took a gap year

75
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,560
and traveled through Southeast Asia,

76
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:36,040
nor is it the Kantian notion of a synthesis of perceptions,

77
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,360
nor is it whatever Locke and Hume think about experience.

78
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,880
It's precisely that.

79
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:43,160
It's the dialectical movement

80
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,280
by which consciousness realizes

81
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,760
that its conception of knowledge is incoherent,

82
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,840
that it's not a way of knowing the object

83
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,440
that it takes itself to know

84
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,160
and generates a new conception of knowledge

85
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,880
and thereby generates a new conception

86
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,360
of the object of knowledge.

87
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,760
That's what experience is.

88
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,960
Okay.

89
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,480
Sorry, what?

90
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,960
Can you say it's true or there?

91
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,040
No, sorry.

92
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,880
Okay, in this exposition,

93
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,720
in this exposition of the course of experience,

94
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:21,440
there is a moment through which the exposition

95
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,000
seems not to correspond

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,120
with what is ordinarily understood by experience.

97
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,680
The transition, namely from the first object

98
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,520
and the knowing of it to the other object

99
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,400
about which one says that it is learned from experience

100
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,560
was specified in such a way

101
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,800
that the knowing of the first object

102
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,200
or the being for consciousness of the first in itself

103
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,640
is itself supposed to become the second object.

104
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,240
So Hegel's referring back to some stuff that I skipped,

105
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,960
so I'll just summarize it.

106
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,680
So Hegel's idea is if this is the first,

107
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,000
I'll just erase the thought bubble.

108
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,880
I'll erase the thought bubble

109
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,200
because the thought bubble is now just implied

110
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,360
in everything I said.

111
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,080
Everything that I, everything on the blackboard

112
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,880
until further notice is the name of the thought bubble

113
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,400
because the phenomenology is imminent to consciousness.

114
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,920
We're not talking about objects themselves.

115
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,240
We're talking about consciousness's conception of the object.

116
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,840
What consciousness says is the object of knowledge.

117
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:28,760
Not what we think the object is or what objects are.

118
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,560
Okay.

119
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:36,560
So Hegel has said, which he's now referring back to,

120
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,680
is that if this is the first shape of consciousness,

121
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,200
the new shape of consciousness

122
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,400
is that what consciousness knows,

123
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:04,160
the second object is the relationship

124
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,160
of the consciousness to the object in the first shape.

125
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,680
This relationship is what the object is.

126
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,280
I should actually probably know.

127
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,960
Okay.

128
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,040
Now why isn't it?

129
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,520
So let me give you an example.

130
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,120
Here's an example.

131
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:40,880
In Kant, the critique of theory is it begins

132
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,800
with what Kant thinks of as the natural presupposition.

133
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,680
I know things in themselves.

134
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,520
And I do throw through sensing.

135
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,280
That is, we're intuiting them.

136
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,560
The argument of the transcendental aesthetic

137
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,720
is that this does not relate you to things in themselves.

138
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
You don't know things in themselves.

139
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
You know their appearances to you.

140
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,040
So what you know is not this,

141
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,040
but how this relates to you

142
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,360
and how it relates to you in this way.

143
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,840
You know not this,

144
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,120
but how this appears to you in intuition.

145
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,880
So Hegel thinks when you find out that you don't know this,

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,040
that this is not a way of knowing this,

147
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,680
the next shape of consciousness is that what you know

148
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,520
is that things relating to you in this way.

149
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,240
So in the Kantian example,

150
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,240
this would be the appearance of things in themselves.

151
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,920
So you start out by claiming to know a certain object.

152
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,360
Your knowing isn't a way of knowing that object.

153
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,640
What it's a way of knowing

154
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,840
is how that object relates to you in that relation.

155
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:09,760
So that the second object is the relation

156
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,440
of the first object to consciousness in the first form.

157
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,880
Or it's the first relation of consciousness to the object.

158
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,400
By contrast, it ordinarily seems that we learn

159
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,720
from experience of the untruth of our first concept

160
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,400
in another object that we perhaps come across

161
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,720
serendipitously and extrinsically,

162
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,720
that the only thing that is left to us

163
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,320
is the pure grasping of what is in and for itself.

164
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,320
Ordinarily we assume that we think we know stuff

165
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,680
and then we come upon some other objects.

166
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,320
We go explore and we're like oh,

167
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,960
that's not what knowledge was,

168
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,920
but that's a merely empirical case

169
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,400
of undermining knowledge.

170
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,280
We're interested in a sort of categorical collapse

171
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,640
of an entire conception of knowledge,

172
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,600
not some particular things of knowledge.

173
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,480
That's like finding out that Fargo

174
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,200
is not the capital of North Dakota.

175
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,920
This observation of the matter is our addition,

176
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,440
whereby this series of, sorry,

177
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,000
however, based on the point of view given above,

178
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,360
the new object shows itself to have come to be

179
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,220
through a reversal of consciousness itself.

180
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,740
So this new object is, it comes to be

181
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,140
through the undermining of this shape of consciousness.

182
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,900
Then there's a kicker.

183
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,980
This observation of the matter,

184
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,420
namely that the object of the second shape of consciousness

185
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:42,060
is the first relation to the first object.

186
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,980
It's the appearing of things of themselves,

187
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,220
not things of themselves.

188
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,780
This observation of the matter is our addition,

189
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:54,140
whereby the series of experiences traversed

190
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,540
by consciousness is elevated into a scientific progression

191
00:09:57,540 --> 00:10:00,400
and which is not there for the consciousness

192
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,020
that we are observing.

193
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,020
So this transition and the fact that the second object

194
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,540
is the first relation to the first object

195
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,840
is not, Hegel says, for consciousness.

196
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,460
It is for us.

197
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,140
What does that mean?

198
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:32,520
What that means is that if we draw the thought bubble,

199
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:38,020
this shape of consciousness conceives of itself

200
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,100
as knowing this object in this way,

201
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,580
but the fact that this object

202
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:48,580
is the first relation to the first object

203
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,980
is not something that it is in self-consciousness.

204
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,260
That is to say, the shape of consciousness

205
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,300
does not know that it arose from this.

206
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,300
It's not constitutive of this shape of consciousness

207
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,920
that it is aware of itself as the successor of this.

208
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,900
Because why would it be?

209
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:16,940
It's not constitutive to knowing this in this way

210
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,940
that you know that you arose from that.

211
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,720
This is our addition.

212
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,660
So there's a distinction in the phenomenology,

213
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,540
in every scene of the phenomenology,

214
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,380
between what is for us and what is for consciousness.

215
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,140
That is to say, there's a distinction between

216
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,500
what we say about consciousness

217
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,860
and what consciousness says about itself.

218
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,920
And what consciousness says about itself

219
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,760
has to always be imminently developed

220
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,720
from consciousness itself.

221
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:49,720
So the for us remarks can be preliminary

222
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,640
or they can indicate the shape of the science,

223
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,960
but they can't themselves be,

224
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,080
they can't include the undermining.

225
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,640
Otherwise, the imminence of the exposition would be.

226
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:09,960
So what we do scientifically is order these things

227
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,320
in this way.

228
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,440
But that, this thing undermines itself

229
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,200
is not something we do to it.

230
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,320
It does it to itself.

231
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:20,480
But we, what's sometimes referred to

232
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,240
as the phenomenological observer,

233
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,880
the reader and the author of the phenomenology,

234
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,960
we order these shapes of consciousness in this way.

235
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,160
And that generates a scientific development.

236
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,040
So now we have a principled reason

237
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,400
for the beginning, the order, and the end.

238
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,420
And in any Hegelian science,

239
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:43,320
you always have to ask yourself where it begins,

240
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,320
what the principle of movement of it is,

241
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,480
and where it ends.

242
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,660
Okay, reading a little bit further.

243
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:55,360
However, this is in fact also the same situation

244
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,600
already discussed above concerning the relation

245
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,680
of the exposition to skepticism.

246
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,240
Namely, that each and every result which emerges

247
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,040
from a non-truthful knowing should not coalesce

248
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,600
into an empty nothing,

249
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,520
but rather must necessarily be grasped

250
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,760
as a nothing of that of which it is the result.

251
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,680
A result which contains the truth

252
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,760
that the previous knowing has within itself.

253
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:21,120
So this result is not an abstract nothing.

254
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,100
It's not just the giving up on knowledge.

255
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,560
It's this determinant negation of this.

256
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,600
It's, there's something it isn't.

257
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,520
It isn't that.

258
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,480
It's for us specifically not that shape of consciousness

259
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,280
because that shape of consciousness undermined itself.

260
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:44,560
And this relation is what Hegel calls being the truth of.

261
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,520
So what that means is this,

262
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,880
when it thinks itself fully undermines itself,

263
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,920
and this is what resolves the problem in a principled way.

264
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:11,600
So this contains whatever was true in this.

265
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Now that means truth is not on or off.

266
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,720
Things are not true or not.

267
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,680
Truth here is a relational notion,

268
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,040
being the truth of something else.

269
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,700
And so things can be more or less true.

270
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,920
This is the truth of that.

271
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,080
The third shape is the truth of the second shape.

272
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,840
As we do this, we get truer and truer.

273
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,760
Now truth for Hegel is gonna turn out to be

274
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,060
the agreement of something with its concept.

275
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,940
So what this is is,

276
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,040
knowledge becoming more and more

277
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,920
in agreement with its concept.

278
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,000
Now what is the concept of knowledge?

279
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,640
We don't know yet.

280
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,600
It's up to consciousness to say.

281
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,880
It's up to the exposition of the phenomenology

282
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,120
to unfold from consciousness what the concept

283
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,400
of knowledge is.

284
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,000
If we just said what the concept of knowledge is

285
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,400
from the beginning, we would be begging the question.

286
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
We would be falling into the second form

287
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,960
of the dilemma of the criteria.

288
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,160
Yeah.

289
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,520
Can you explain what it means for something

290
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,580
to contain the truth of something else?

291
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,420
In what sense does the thing on the left

292
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,260
contain the truth of it?

293
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,580
I mean in a certain way, this schematic diagram

294
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:41,060
is all that can be said about that.

295
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,960
What for something to contain the truth of something else

296
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:49,960
is for it to be the principled successor to that.

297
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:56,400
So X is the truth of Y if X is the principled successor

298
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:00,460
of Y in virtue of Y negating itself.

299
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,380
Yes.

300
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,780
Yes, I have a question.

301
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,620
You've been making a distinction between

302
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,060
what we say about consciousness

303
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,140
and what consciousness says for itself.

304
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:15,140
But anything we assert as consciousness says for itself,

305
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,700
we're saying it equals something.

306
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,540
Sorry, say that again?

307
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,540
Okay.

308
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:24,780
So there's the distinction between what we say

309
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:29,620
about consciousness, namely we order the past consciousness

310
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,700
and what consciousness says for itself.

311
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,860
But how can making this at all means

312
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:42,540
whatever the wire gets cut by others?

313
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:43,380
Yeah, okay.

314
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,740
So by consciousness, Hegel doesn't mean

315
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,300
like consciousness in general.

316
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,660
He means by a particular shape of consciousness.

317
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,300
Of course, we're conscious.

318
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,900
But when Hegel refers to something as consciousness,

319
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,660
he means it's consciousness and nothing more.

320
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:03,500
Not, and this goes back to a point from earlier,

321
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:07,460
not that it isn't in any way that further thing,

322
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:10,260
but it hasn't yet grasped itself as that further thing.

323
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,660
So Hegel won't call us consciousness,

324
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,220
although of course we're conscious,

325
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,180
because we are something more.

326
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:21,540
In particular, insofar as you are reading

327
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,860
the phenomenology of spirit,

328
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,080
you're always one step ahead of a shape of consciousness.

329
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,660
You always know something more than it about itself.

330
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,040
So you are not merely identical

331
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,780
with that shape of consciousness.

332
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:35,560
So one way of distinguishing this

333
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,520
is thinking about what a shape of consciousness

334
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:41,040
is implicitly and what it is explicitly.

335
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,560
All of these shapes of consciousness

336
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,500
are implicitly spirit.

337
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,180
They're implicitly absolute no.

338
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:52,180
Because they contain in themselves the imminent criteria,

339
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,880
which when thought through by themselves

340
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,220
will lead to absolute no.

341
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,840
But they are not explicitly absolute no.

342
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:06,080
So we are, I'm more than just implicitly consciousness.

343
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,280
I'm explicitly something more than consciousness.

344
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,720
And so Hegel won't refer to me

345
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,920
or himself as mere consciousness.

346
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,360
Yeah.

347
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,680
So choosing the successor of truth,

348
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,760
it's like, for example,

349
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,960
is there a absurd stage of consciousness?

350
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,560
That's the truth of the first stage of consciousness,

351
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,960
also preserved and disturbed in the system.

352
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:31,800
Yes, yes.

353
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,680
So the truth of is transitive.

354
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,920
So we're going to try to figure that out.

355
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,200
So you guys speak up.

356
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,320
Oh, we're going to be trying to figure that distinction

357
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:44,600
between consciousness as we felt a number more

358
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,480
and consciousness, what we can claim about it,

359
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,920
could be similar to how we can claim thought and object.

360
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,400
So we are making claims about consciousness

361
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,880
as it appears to us,

362
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:58,880
just to speak between us making a claim about consciousness

363
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,280
and consciousness as it's also looking more important.

364
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,440
Yes, except that our claims about consciousness

365
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:10,680
are not supposed to be one of the shapes of consciousness

366
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,240
in this sequence.

367
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,080
Thank you.

368
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,760
Okay, let me just, let me just,

369
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,720
let's just read a little bit further.

370
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,560
However, this is in fact also the same situation

371
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,600
already discussed above concerning the relation

372
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,520
of this exposition to skepticism,

373
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,800
namely that each and every result

374
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,480
which emerges from a non-truthful known

375
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,360
should not coalesce into an empty nothing.

376
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:31,000
So not just the rejection of knowledge,

377
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,840
but rather must be necessarily grasped

378
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,120
as the nothing of that of which it is the result,

379
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,720
or result which contains the truth

380
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,040
that the previous knowing has within itself.

381
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,120
Here it presents itself as follows.

382
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,880
Well, what at first appeared as the object

383
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,400
generating for consciousness into a knowing of the object,

384
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,960
and in itself becomes a being for consciousness

385
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,920
of the in itself, the latter is the new object,

386
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,320
the being of consciousness for the in itself.

387
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,280
That's this point.

388
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,880
The being of consciousness for the object is the new object.

389
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,240
The previous being of object,

390
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,000
being of the object for consciousness,

391
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
that's what this is, is the new object.

392
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,320
As a result, a new shape of consciousness comes on the scene

393
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,000
for which the essence is something different

394
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,960
from what was the essence for the preceding shape.

395
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,560
Okay, so let me just say something about the word essence.

396
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,760
Hegel has this, the word here is vesen.

397
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,960
So now vesen in German is more general

398
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,120
than essence in English.

399
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,520
It can be a being, like an entity can also be a vesen.

400
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:42,520
So what Hegel means by vesen is whatever the standard

401
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,480
of whatever it is that knowledge has to correspond to

402
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,200
in order to count as knowledge.

403
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,640
So you might think, well, isn't that just

404
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,760
what the object is?

405
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,240
Yes, at the beginning, but over the course

406
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,080
of the phenomenology, something other than the object

407
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,560
is going to come to count as the vesen.

408
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:04,360
So the progress of the phenomenology is that consciousness,

409
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,480
knowing something that's an object will turn out

410
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,880
to be incoherent.

411
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,800
And then the vesen will turn out to be the subject.

412
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:14,880
It will turn out to be that what the subject has to do

413
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,080
in order to know objects is come into an agreement

414
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,520
with itself.

415
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,360
But we're not going to actually read those sections

416
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,880
of phenomenology.

417
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,000
So just understand, vesen is like a functional term.

418
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,800
It means whatever is that which knowledge has to correspond

419
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,440
to or agree with in order to be knowledge.

420
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,160
But for now, the object is playing the vesen term.

421
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:44,160
And in fact, consciousness is more or less identified,

422
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,160
or identical for Hegel, with a conception of knowledge

423
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,120
with the object plays the role of vesen.

424
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,680
Okay, this is what's so great about only teaching

425
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,880
the easy parts of Hegel.

426
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,280
In case you're wondering, this is like the easiest

427
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,360
ten pages of Hegel.

428
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,360
Okay, as a result of, if you guys go,

429
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,600
oh, I don't know how I'm getting through this,

430
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:11,720
like you have no idea, like it won't get that bad

431
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,240
in this class, but it gets infinitely worse than this.

432
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,840
As a result, a new shape of consciousness comes on the scene,

433
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,200
you can already read that, is this circumstance

434
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,280
which guides the whole series of shapes of consciousness

435
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,680
in their necessity.

436
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,280
So that's super crucial.

437
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:31,280
The progression of the shapes of consciousness

438
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,360
has to be necessary.

439
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,560
There has to be no arbitrariness or contingency

440
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,400
in one shape of consciousness being the successor

441
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,560
to the previous one.

442
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,720
That's why the merely historical reading

443
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,880
of the phenomenology has to be wrong.

444
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,480
The fact that one shape of consciousness

445
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,120
historically succeeds another,

446
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,120
it does not by itself demonstrate any necessity.

447
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,320
So if all this were, were a super high level

448
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,800
philosophical account of intellectual history,

449
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,000
it would demonstrate nothing about necessity.

450
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:08,880
What it could be, so there's like the pure historical reading,

451
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,560
this is literally just a catalog of what happens in history

452
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,040
but described in terms of historical period

453
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:19,160
self conceptions, that can't be right.

454
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:23,320
What it could be right is it's a description, it's that,

455
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,000
plus each of those historically extant conceptions

456
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,040
of knowledge incoherently undermines itself

457
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,960
and necessitates the next one.

458
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,800
So that's a little bit better, still wrong because A,

459
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,360
Hegel explicitly says that it's false,

460
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,080
the book ends, Hegel says something that's completely

461
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,440
in the battle with that, which we will read.

462
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,520
And furthermore, the chronology is wrong.

463
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:49,280
In fact, Newtonian science occurred after the ancient Greeks.

464
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,360
So, sorry guys, okay.

465
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,320
There's very few pure historical readers

466
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,040
of the phenomenology of the spirit left

467
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,160
but I have like a bad reaction to this

468
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:02,800
because I survived my first Hegel class partly

469
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,200
by just ingesting Michael Forster's book

470
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:07,960
about the phenomenology of the spirit.

471
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,240
The first half of which is very good,

472
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,000
it's all about Hegel's response to skepticism

473
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,760
but the rest of which is just the pure intellectual

474
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,480
distribution of phenomenology, which is very,

475
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,560
which is bad in pernicious.

476
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,320
However, it is just this necessity itself

477
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,480
or the emergence of the new object

478
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,040
which presents itself to consciousness

479
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:28,880
without consciousness knowing how this happens to it.

480
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:33,880
So this consciousness is unaware of its own history.

481
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,920
Now at a certain point in the phenomenology,

482
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,000
that will change and a shape of consciousness

483
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,400
will become explicitly self-conscious

484
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,120
of its development out of logically prior

485
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,400
to self-consciousness.

486
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,920
But we're not there yet.

487
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:55,200
Through this, there enters into the movement

488
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,160
of consciousness a moment of the in itself

489
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,080
or of being for us.

490
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,640
So this is a different use of in itself.

491
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,420
So sometimes Hegel uses in itself to mean this.

492
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,640
Sometimes what Hegel means but in itself

493
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:15,640
is a contrast between what is in itself and for itself.

494
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,240
And that approximately means what something

495
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:30,240
implicitly is without grasping it.

496
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,200
And for itself, what explicitly it is

497
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,800
what it grasps itself as such.

498
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,520
So let me give you an example.

499
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:57,240
Let's use the standard bad movie, The Hero.

500
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:03,960
Luke Skywalker is the savior of the galaxy

501
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:09,960
and the savior of the Jedi in himself from the beginning.

502
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:15,640
But only in Return of the Jedi is he that form himself.

503
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:18,900
I shy away from Star Wars examples

504
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,560
because I find that they're one of the few pieces

505
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:26,000
of pop culture that I share, that I know,

506
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,680
that my students also know.

507
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:31,000
And so then I tend to use them too much.

508
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,800
And then people think that I'm way more into Star Wars.

509
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,200
So then I will try, I will try to use the Star Wars

510
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,320
reference experiment.

511
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:46,160
Theologically, Jesus is the son of God in himself

512
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,580
before he takes on or accepts that identity.

513
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:52,280
Then he is the son of God for himself.

514
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:58,680
It is this circumstance, however it is just this necessity.

515
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,480
So these shapes of consciousness are in themselves

516
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,560
gauges on the path to absolute nothing.

517
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:09,640
But they are not those for themselves

518
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,800
because consciousness is not aware of that.

519
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,720
And in the phenomenology, the in itself,

520
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,400
but not for itself, can be identified with what is for us

521
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,120
and not for consciousness.

522
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,860
So in the phenomenology we can identify these risks,

523
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:29,860
what is for us, and what is for consciousness.

524
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,640
Okay.

525
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,600
So just a note on Hegelian tactical terminology.

526
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,560
People, I've had this experience multiple times

527
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,400
that students would be like,

528
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,880
I've been reading the phenomenology on my own

529
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,800
and I totally get it.

530
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,760
Could you just tell me though what the in itself

531
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,360
and the for itself are?

532
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:52,320
And the reason that question is very hard to answer

533
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,520
and slightly frustrating to be asked

534
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:58,640
is the meaning of Hegel's tactical terminology,

535
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,240
like everything else, has to be developed

536
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,480
imminently over the course of the science.

537
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,520
So these are to some extent like my external remarks

538
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,740
because I've read this book many times helping you along.

539
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,240
But properly speaking, the meaning of the in itself

540
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,400
or the for itself is going to change

541
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,320
over the course of the phenomenology.

542
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,000
So the only thing that we can say

543
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,960
that's like genuinely true illuminating

544
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,360
is some kind of like general structural features

545
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,120
of how these terms are used.

546
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,960
And in particular, when we get to the logic,

547
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,000
I'll actually, the in itself is actually in the part

548
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,320
of the logic we want to talk about.

549
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:37,720
The logic develops in principle and purely imminently

550
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,520
the pure technical meaning of these terms.

551
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,000
Which does not present itself for the consciousness

552
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,680
which is itself comprehended in the experience itself.

553
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,420
However, the content of what emerges to us

554
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,160
is for consciousness.

555
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,800
And we comprehend only what is formal in it

556
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,460
or its pure emergence.

557
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,300
For consciousness, what is emerged is only as object.

558
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,780
That is to say, what's emerged is an object

559
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:07,140
that it claims to know.

560
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,900
For us, what is emerged is that the same time emerges

561
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,460
as movement and coming to be.

562
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,380
But we understand this as having come to be from that.

563
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,700
Well remember, movement is just the name

564
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,260
for this purely conceptual process

565
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,020
of one conception of knowledge undermining itself

566
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,940
and giving rise purely logically to another.

567
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,780
And this process and this movement

568
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,180
is not happening in time.

569
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,340
Okay, through this necessity, this path to science

570
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:41,260
is itself already science.

571
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:45,280
Earlier he said, this doesn't appear to be science,

572
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:48,780
but now he's telling you, this is actually science.

573
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,900
But we don't know what science is.

574
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:54,660
So that is a provisional remark for something

575
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,540
that will have to be proven by the end of the book.

576
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,520
In fact, in doing the science of logic,

577
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,140
sorry, the phonology of spirit,

578
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,940
we are actually doing science.

579
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,540
This is actually scientific now.

580
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,860
And according to its content, it is thereby the science

581
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,140
of the experience of consciousness.

582
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:14,420
Okay, now those of you who pay very close attention,

583
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:16,140
actually this may not have been in the reading,

584
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,060
but if you have a copy of the book,

585
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:21,380
you'll notice that the title page of this book

586
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:24,180
is Science of the Experience of Consciousness.

587
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,040
So if you look at this book, it has one title page

588
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:32,340
that says, Phenomenology of Spirit,

589
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,600
and then it has a preface and an introduction.

590
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,860
And then there's another title page saying,

591
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:40,020
Science of the Experience of Consciousness.

592
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,260
Why does this book have two titles?

593
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,260
The reason is that the original title of this book

594
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:48,160
was the Science of the Experience of Consciousness.

595
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,680
Halfway through the book, Hegel decided

596
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,740
that it needed a second half

597
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,060
and that it should bear the title,

598
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:57,020
Phenomenology of Spirit.

599
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:00,060
The problem is the first half of the book had been printed.

600
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:03,220
And in the early 19th century,

601
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,580
paper is very, very valuable.

602
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:10,580
So the printer was not gonna pulp half of a book.

603
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:16,540
So instead, they printed the rest of the book

604
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,160
with the original title page

605
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,340
and then just added another title page.

606
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,180
And you can in fact,

607
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:23,300
that card first has proven this

608
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:28,020
by examining the very most original first editions

609
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,620
of the Phenomenology of Spirit.

610
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,500
So here at the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library,

611
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,420
we have one of the very early editions,

612
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,300
but there were even earlier ones.

613
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,140
This is maybe boring, but it's extremely interesting

614
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,580
to me, so I'm gonna bore you with it.

615
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,540
There was a practice.

616
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:45,940
So book publishers were also booksellers in,

617
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,860
sorry, printers were also booksellers

618
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,260
in the early 19th century.

619
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:55,780
So a publisher or a printer that was publishing a book,

620
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,140
you could subscribe to that book

621
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:01,780
and they would send you the parts of the book

622
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,620
as they were getting printed.

623
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,900
So an 18th century book is printed

624
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,380
on these gigantic pieces of paper

625
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:11,860
that are folded together and then they print off them.

626
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,340
You could subscribe and as those got printed,

627
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,860
they would send them to you.

628
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,180
And then when the whole thing was done,

629
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:20,860
you would send it back, they would bind it together

630
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,460
and then you'd have your book.

631
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:25,420
And so Eckhart first found one of these

632
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,100
of the Phenomenology of Spirit

633
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,100
and he proved on the basis of the folds of the page

634
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:36,100
that the original first fold of the Phenomenology of Spirit

635
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:40,540
has the title, Science of the Experience of Consciousness

636
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:44,300
and then when they asked for everybody's folds back,

637
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,400
they cut off a couple of pages

638
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,200
and then added the rest of it.

639
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,560
And he has a claim about these various pages

640
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:54,000
in Hegel's not lost the papers that were left

641
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,160
over his death about what those missing pages are.

642
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,280
This unfortunately is not something

643
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,840
we're gonna be able to cover in this class.

644
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,920
Now I realize that this may be very sad.

645
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:06,920
Okay, so why did he go from calling it

646
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,680
a science of the experience of consciousness

647
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,280
to the Phenomenology of Spirit?

648
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,200
Because the original plan of the book

649
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,360
is that it ends, so the book was originally supposed

650
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,720
to contain consciousness, self-consciousness,

651
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,160
and reason.

652
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:42,640
Spirit is where the, this is the original plan.

653
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,200
This is the original plan.

654
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:46,520
This is something called the Four Phenomenology.

655
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,840
This is where the second half of the book starts.

656
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,720
So the original plan of the book

657
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,760
didn't have the spirit section.

658
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,960
So then for some reason, Hegel decided

659
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,960
the book needed a second half

660
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:03,840
that includes spirit, religion, and absolute damage.

661
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,560
Yeah, spirit, religion, and absolute damage.

662
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:13,560
And he decided that what the whole thing is

663
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,640
is not just the science of the experience of consciousness

664
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,440
but the Phenomenology of Spirit.

665
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:32,480
So really, this is what was originally

666
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,880
the science of the experience of consciousness.

667
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:38,000
So now it's possible, and this is the kind of thing

668
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,360
that we would have to deal with

669
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,440
if we were doing a class of the whole Phenomenology,

670
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,680
that this description of the project of the Phenomenology

671
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,640
applies only to this.

672
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,760
And then, imminently, within the reason section,

673
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,960
we transition to a different project.

674
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:56,600
I don't think that's quite right, but regardless,

675
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,800
what does it mean that the whole thing

676
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,240
is a Phenomenology of Spirit?

677
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,840
Okay, so now this goes back to a question

678
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,040
that was asked earlier.

679
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,400
Who asked this question?

680
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,280
The meeting of Phenomenology.

681
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,520
Yes, Isaac, okay.

682
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,400
So Phenomenology, right, just linguistically,

683
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:17,080
means the logos of Phenomena.

684
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,360
Oh, this board is really messy, I apologize for that.

685
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,880
But it might just, you know, they do not need to,

686
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,280
they do not need to add weight for this.

687
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,640
Okay, Phenomenology.

688
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,280
This is the logos, or the rational account of Phenomena,

689
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,080
of Appearance.

690
00:35:55,320 --> 00:36:00,320
So this is the science of the Appearance of Spirit.

691
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,320
So it's the scientific account of how Spirit appears

692
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:15,440
up until, or up and until, Spirit is fully

693
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,880
in and for itself.

694
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,000
It's fully explicit for itself that it's Spirit.

695
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,000
Now, what is the appearance of Spirit?

696
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,520
It's not like Spirit is, it's the appearance

697
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,160
of Spirit to Spirit.

698
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,640
It's the appearance of Spirit to consciousness.

699
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:34,560
Consciousness is ever more adequate conception

700
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,760
of itself as Spirit.

701
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,960
So this is what I was talking about before.

702
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:42,720
That means consciousness is ever more truthful,

703
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,560
ever more adequate conception of it not being

704
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,880
fundamentally different from anything else.

705
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:51,200
Of there not being anything that's radically distinct

706
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,040
from Spirit.

707
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,440
There's no outside to Spirit.

708
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,320
There are things that are distinct from Spirit,

709
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,800
but their fundamental structure is the same

710
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,040
as the structure of Spirit.

711
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,560
And so all of being, all of reality is in principle

712
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,760
transparent to Spirit.

713
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,040
It's in principle transparent to knowing.

714
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:08,840
Okay, so that means that this introduction

715
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,720
is not an introduction to the Phenomenology of Spirit.

716
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,680
It's an introduction to the science of the Experience

717
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,120
of Consciousness.

718
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,960
That's why there's no explanation of why it's called

719
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,360
a Phenomenology of Spirit.

720
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Although there is an explanation of why it's the science

721
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,160
of the Experience of Consciousness.

722
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:26,480
And it means that something really important happened

723
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,600
because Hegel decided that the book could not end here.

724
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,680
So once again, in a complete account of the Phenomenology

725
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,920
of Spirit, we would have to,

726
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,520
this transition is really crucial.

727
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,560
Why does the book not end with reason?

728
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:42,160
Why does it move to Spirit?

729
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,360
And what is the particular nature of Spirit?

730
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,320
Okay, so let's just do the last paragraph.

731
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,800
The experience through which consciousness learns

732
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:55,800
about itself can, according to its concept,

733
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,560
comprehend within itself nothing less

734
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:01,040
than the whole system of consciousness.

735
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,440
Okay, so this is an obsession of German philosophy

736
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:08,200
between Kant and Hegel, the systematicity of science.

737
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:09,840
So we don't wanna just have science.

738
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,360
Science has to be a system.

739
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,520
However, Hegel hasn't imminently justified

740
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,000
the notion of system.

741
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,160
That he's gonna have to do.

742
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,520
So this is a provisional remark

743
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,840
for something that's gonna come.

744
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,760
And we'll talk about when we get to Hegel's system,

745
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,160
in what way it's systematic.

746
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,840
Nothing less than the whole system of consciousness

747
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,880
or the whole realm of the truth of spirit.

748
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:33,040
So the moments of truth present themselves

749
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:35,200
in this, their proper determinateness,

750
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,440
not as being abstract pure moments,

751
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,080
but rather in the way that they are for consciousness

752
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,160
or in the way that consciousness itself comes

753
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,040
on the scene in relation to that.

754
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,520
In this way, the moments of the whole

755
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,120
are shapes of consciousness.

756
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,240
So the moments of the whole are the individual aspects

757
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,160
or parts of this development

758
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:56,040
from natural consciousness to absolute known.

759
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,120
By consciousness carrying a word

760
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,960
on towards its true existence,

761
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,800
it will reach a point where it sets aside

762
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,400
its semblance of being burdened with what is alien.

763
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,240
So the end point of the phenomenology is willing to be

764
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,680
in part giving up what Hegel here describes

765
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,480
as a semblance, the idea that consciousness is burdened

766
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,320
with an object distinct from itself that it has to know.

767
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,320
Absolute knowing, as I said before,

768
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,960
is gonna involve some kind of getting rid

769
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,480
of the distinctness of the object

770
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,280
or a collapse of the subject and the object together

771
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,400
so that no possible distinction

772
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,400
between subject and object can arise

773
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,240
that would generate the skeptical problems

774
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,480
that undermine previous shapes of consciousness.

775
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,080
A point where the appearance becomes equal to the essence,

776
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,800
the essence being that which has to be known,

777
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,360
the appearance being its relationship to consciousness,

778
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,160
so that its own exposition coincides at this very point

779
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,640
with the genuine science of spirit

780
00:39:55,640 --> 00:40:00,440
so that this exposition will itself also have been,

781
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:04,440
will turn out to be a scientific knowing of what spirit is.

782
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:07,480
Finally, while itself grasping this, its own essence,

783
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,560
consciousness will signify the nature

784
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,220
of absolute knowing itself.

785
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,920
So just to anticipate slightly spoiler alert,

786
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,360
this joke that people like to make on Twitter,

787
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,000
the real journey, the real destination

788
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,840
was the friends we made along the way.

789
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,440
This is in a certain way the key idea of Hegel.

790
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,480
Or the slightly less jokey version,

791
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,240
the journey is the destination.

792
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,960
That in a certain way, I'll try to justify this philosophically

793
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,080
over the course of this semester

794
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,720
and make this not sound so silly.

795
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,320
That in a certain way is the key idea of Hegel.

796
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:46,320
That actually, what absolute knowing is going to be,

797
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,680
is going to turn out to be what we've been doing all along.

798
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,920
So the end of the phenomenology of spirit,

799
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,760
the end of all of Hegel's books

800
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,720
have this weird, dissatisfying character.

801
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:00,600
You're like, wait, I wanted to know what absolute knowing was.

802
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,040
Why can't you tell me?

803
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,640
And the answer is, you've been owning absolutely all along.

804
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,400
But you've been absolutely knowing in itself.

805
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,160
At the end, you have absolute knowledge for itself.

806
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,840
You absolutely, you explicitly grasp

807
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:17,440
what you've been doing all along as absolute knowing.

808
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,240
And that is one of the reasons,

809
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,080
if the journey is the destination,

810
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:29,080
then the content of Hegel's philosophy,

811
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:33,000
the P in Hegel, is the way you get to the P.

812
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,640
They're inseparable.

813
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:39,160
Which means Hegel cannot cut to the chase.

814
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,480
That means there's no way for Hegel to communicate

815
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,640
the so-called content of Hegel's thought,

816
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,760
other than by you doing it yourself.

817
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,520
That is why the books are so hard to read.

818
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,440
You have to rethink every of Hegel's ideas

819
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,880
in order to understand every one of the claims.

820
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,800
There's no choice in reading Hegel,

821
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,320
but to recapitulate the thought of Hegel

822
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:12,720
in grasping the thought of Hegel.

823
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,360
If there was a distinction between form and content,

824
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,440
there could be P, and there could be my argument that P,

825
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,240
and those would be different things.

826
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,320
But for Hegel, they're one and the same.

827
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,520
Which means that they aren't a value of P.

828
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,680
Because P cannot be identical to an argument that P.

829
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,520
I mean, it's a very bad argument that P.

830
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,120
I mean, it's a value, right?

831
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:40,200
And for many values of P, it is sound as well.

832
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,680
But still, a very valid argument.

833
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:46,280
So in some sense, where the phenomenology of spirit

834
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:51,280
is going to end is that this has been absolute knowing

835
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,400
all along.

836
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,800
Sounds super weird, sounds kind of oaky,

837
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,240
sounds slightly new-agey.

838
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,600
But I hope that I will be able to false off and justify it

839
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,840
as not totally stupid over the course of this much.

840
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,800
Okay, we have some time.

841
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,120
I just want to say, those who have taken classes

842
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,320
with me before know that I tend not to keep to the syllabus,

843
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,960
I tend to slow down.

844
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,400
I think in my entire life,

845
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:16,400
I have never actually kept to a syllabus.

846
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:20,360
I think one time, I only was like one week behind,

847
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,960
or even like half a week behind.

848
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,960
It's possible that I will slow down from the syllabus.

849
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,920
But there is, I have in my mind,

850
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,020
a kind of condensed version where we can speed

851
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,260
through certain things,

852
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,740
and we'll still start at the beginning and get to the end.

853
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:40,380
So we'll see the big structure of Hegel's system,

854
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:41,940
even if we speed through certain things

855
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,780
or slow down on other things.

856
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:44,820
Questions?

857
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:45,660
Yes.

858
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:49,180
So when they say P is the right to get to the P,

859
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,220
so what's the meaning of experience?

860
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:57,540
Experience is, as Hegel says,

861
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:02,020
consciousness undermining one's conception of knowledge,

862
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:04,580
which gives rise to another conception of knowledge.

863
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,100
That's what experience is.

864
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:10,460
In a certain way, absolute knowing

865
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:13,020
is not the experience of consciousness,

866
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,460
but the science of the experience of consciousness.

867
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:19,400
It's that experience in its systematic totalitarian,

868
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,620
a principled beginning, a principled law of the series,

869
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,060
and a principled end.

870
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:25,900
Yeah.

871
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:29,060
So is consciousness here a proper noun,

872
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:31,140
like as you're referring to an entity,

873
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,860
or is it just a functional world,

874
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:38,860
like in point to that you're conscious of something

875
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,380
that's like a function, not like an entity by itself?

876
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,260
I mean, my inclination is to respond to you

877
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:49,500
by saying that that's a false dichotomy,

878
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,700
because functions are entities,

879
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:55,100
and consciousness is definitely a noun, just grammatically.

880
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,380
But I feel like there's something

881
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,180
that's more behind your question.

882
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:01,700
So what lies behind this question?

883
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,380
So what lies behind the question is that if consciousness

884
00:45:06,380 --> 00:45:10,380
is just a functional world and just a status that I just,

885
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,300
that something is always cognizing,

886
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:14,380
or like conscious of something,

887
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:18,620
and that process is like constantly rebooting itself,

888
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:21,220
and it's not aware that it's even clear of itself,

889
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,460
so it's always for itself.

890
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,620
If consciousness is a proper noun,

891
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:29,060
as like you're referring to an entity,

892
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:32,740
then it can sort of like have passed and recognize

893
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:36,260
the always immediately present in the world.

894
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:37,700
Okay, so what I would say is,

895
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:40,060
we're talking about consciousness,

896
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,660
we're not talking about particular conscious subject.

897
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:43,900
Why are we doing that?

898
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:46,180
Because we're not interested in this conscious subject

899
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:47,540
or that conscious subject,

900
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,140
we're interested in what consciousness is.

901
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:53,140
Okay, now, so we're at one level

902
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:54,780
above individual conscious subject.

903
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:00,300
Furthermore, consciousness is relational.

904
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:03,580
Consciousness is consciousness of something else.

905
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:07,620
In fact, even consciousness will turn into self-consciousness,

906
00:46:08,540 --> 00:46:11,420
which does not mean that consciousness is not self-conscious

907
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,780
in the ordinary sense from the beginning,

908
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:15,220
because as you see, consciousness has a conception

909
00:46:15,220 --> 00:46:16,900
of itself as consciousness.

910
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:19,500
That is to say, in the ordinary sense, it's self-conscious.

911
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:21,220
So we're not gonna read in this class

912
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,500
the transition from consciousness to self-consciousness.

913
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:25,780
But there's this thing that people,

914
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,500
there's this reading that you sometimes hear

915
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,180
where somehow, human beings were not conscious

916
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,580
until they started fighting each other

917
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:34,500
and then they became self-conscious,

918
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,820
which is always very strict,

919
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:38,700
because animals manage to fight each other.

920
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,860
You look at them without being self,

921
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:43,020
put two babies together, they won't fight each other,

922
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,100
like wrestle with each other,

923
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,340
but that's not turned them into self,

924
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:47,820
makes them self-conscious.

925
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:51,140
Of self-consciousness as the second part

926
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,500
of the phenomenal energy of spirit

927
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:55,180
does not refer to self-consciousness

928
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:56,460
in the ordinary sense,

929
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:00,100
but the idea that what consciousness is of,

930
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,420
what knowledge is of,

931
00:47:02,860 --> 00:47:05,340
the essence that makes knowledge knowledge

932
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:07,300
is consciousness is knowledge of itself.

933
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:10,620
So that consciousness,

934
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,900
it sort of speaks self-conscious knowledge of objects.

935
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:14,980
What it needs to know,

936
00:47:14,980 --> 00:47:17,420
what it needs to match its representation to

937
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:18,940
is the object.

938
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,740
Self-consciousness is self-conscious knowledge of itself.

939
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,820
What it needs to match its representation to is itself,

940
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:29,340
including its representations of objects.

941
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,940
So consciousness for Hegel,

942
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,180
even self-consciousness is always relational,

943
00:47:35,100 --> 00:47:36,900
even if it's a relation to itself.

944
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:39,700
So in that sense, maybe that's what you mean by functional.

945
00:47:41,020 --> 00:47:44,540
Consciousness is not, so to speak, an intrinsic property.

946
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:48,260
Does your ever-subscribing impact on Hegel's ideal

947
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:49,940
implicit and explicit?

948
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:50,780
Yes.

949
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,500
Hegel says at the beginning of the philosophy of spirit

950
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,980
that the only thing worth reading about mind,

951
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:58,860
aside from, of course, him, is Aristotle's Diana.

952
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,700
Maybe not the only thing,

953
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:03,900
the best thing ever given by the mind is Diana.

954
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,620
So Hegel thinks of himself,

955
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:07,180
Hegel's attitude towards true philosophy,

956
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:09,540
which we will get to at the end of the course,

957
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,660
is that the history of philosophy is,

958
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:16,700
all of these things that we're gonna describe in Hegel,

959
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:20,460
so there is a, one of the many distorted ways

960
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:22,260
in which Hegel has been received

961
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:23,940
is to think of Hegel as fundamentally

962
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:25,140
a philosopher of history.

963
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:27,860
Hegel is a philosopher of history.

964
00:48:27,860 --> 00:48:29,740
Maybe, probably the best,

965
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:32,340
deepest philosopher of history ever.

966
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:35,460
But the stuff that we're talking about is not historical.

967
00:48:35,460 --> 00:48:38,300
The fundamental stuff in Hegel is not historical.

968
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:41,340
So the logic is not about history.

969
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:43,620
The logic is not about historical categories,

970
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,620
the development of the logic is not historical or temple.

971
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:49,260
It's eternal outside of time.

972
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:53,980
But Hegel thinks those eternal metaphysical logical

973
00:48:53,980 --> 00:48:58,420
structures are realized over time

974
00:48:58,420 --> 00:49:00,860
in human history in philosophy.

975
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,580
So what the history of philosophy is,

976
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:08,740
is the history of philosophers grasping

977
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:13,420
incompletely mutilated non-systematic parts

978
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:16,540
of the complete systematic self-development

979
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:18,380
of non-physical categories.

980
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:21,740
So once you have Hegel's logic on board,

981
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:24,420
you can then look back through the history of philosophy

982
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:27,820
and see aspects of it manifest themselves

983
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:31,500
in Parmenides, Heraclitus, Plato, Aristotle, et cetera.

984
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,340
Hegel is very dismissive of the medieval

985
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:35,180
in his lecture of the history of philosophy.

986
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,780
And then there were some medieval.

987
00:49:36,780 --> 00:49:38,540
Let's ignore that.

988
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,820
Let's start up with Descartes, okay?

989
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:43,620
And really just get to the Germans as quickly as possible.

990
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:49,700
And so Hegel's, we're gonna end the class

991
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,260
by reading a little bit of Hegel's lectures

992
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:52,380
on the history of philosophy.

993
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:55,220
Hegel thinks to confirm this theory,

994
00:49:55,220 --> 00:49:57,780
you have to go back through the history of philosophy

995
00:49:57,780 --> 00:50:01,020
and see this self-developing system

996
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:04,100
of metaphysical structures, which is called the idea.

997
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,540
You have to see it present in the history of philosophy,

998
00:50:07,540 --> 00:50:10,700
just as you have to see in the history of art,

999
00:50:10,700 --> 00:50:12,420
you have to find in the history of art

1000
00:50:12,420 --> 00:50:14,620
the artistic presentation of the idea,

1001
00:50:14,620 --> 00:50:17,740
the presentation of the idea in pictures

1002
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,620
and sculptures and music, et cetera.

1003
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:22,820
And you have to find in the history of religion

1004
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:25,020
the religious presentation of the idea,

1005
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,860
the presentation of the idea in mythology,

1006
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:33,860
in spiritual practice, in holy scriptures, et cetera.

1007
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,180
Yeah?

1008
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:37,980
What would be the tell-off of history?

1009
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:38,820
Of what?

1010
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:40,660
Of history?

1011
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:45,860
No, of his system, like the ultimate.

1012
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,700
The short answer is-

1013
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,660
The historian says the ultimate form,

1014
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:50,100
like the perfect open form.

1015
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:52,460
Reason fully and entirely grasping,

1016
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:53,900
that's all the best reason.

1017
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:56,220
Yeah?

1018
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:58,300
So when history uses phenomenology-

1019
00:50:58,300 --> 00:50:59,340
Oh, excellent, yeah, I didn't answer

1020
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:00,980
the original question, yeah, thank you.

1021
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,260
So yeah, so the phenomenology in Hegel

1022
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:09,260
is just the science of how science appears,

1023
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:16,820
that is to say, shapes of apparent claims

1024
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,020
to knowledge that are not knowledge.

1025
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:20,820
So the science of the experience of consciousness

1026
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,700
could also be called the phenomenology of knowledge.

1027
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:26,780
And the phenomenology of spirit is the logos,

1028
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,820
the science of how spirit appears to itself

1029
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:31,940
as things that are not yet spirit.

1030
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:36,820
It's spirit in itself but not yet for itself.

1031
00:51:36,820 --> 00:51:41,620
It's the scientific exposition of the stages of spirit

1032
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,380
in itself but not yet for itself

1033
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,780
up to and including spirit in and for itself.

1034
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:51,380
Phenomenology in Husserl is this idea

1035
00:51:51,380 --> 00:51:53,620
that what first philosophy should be,

1036
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:58,500
the replacement for metaphysics should be a science

1037
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:02,020
where you just bracket the question

1038
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,860
of whether the objects of consciousness

1039
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:06,340
have any being outside of consciousness,

1040
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:09,140
and you study the pure structure of consciousness.

1041
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:14,020
Now, Hegel just thinks, okay, that's cool,

1042
00:52:14,020 --> 00:52:18,780
but we've already, we've seen that movie before.

1043
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,580
It was called early modern histology.

1044
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:26,380
My general view on, so one of the things

1045
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,220
that's frustrating about the Hegel reception

1046
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,100
is a lot of people think, oh, you know,

1047
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,020
Hegel's a dead dog, let's reject Hegel,

1048
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:36,180
but the objections to Hegel are largely terrible.

1049
00:52:36,180 --> 00:52:37,740
And then what's really frustrating

1050
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,380
is people think they're gonna do this other thing.

1051
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:42,460
And it's like, okay, that view is already a sub-model

1052
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,940
of the phenomenology of spirit.

1053
00:52:43,940 --> 00:52:46,660
Like, Hegel is fully aware of that as a possibility.

1054
00:52:46,660 --> 00:52:48,580
He foresaw it and he refuted it.

1055
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,940
So what are we doing here, guys?

1056
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,180
What are we doing here?

1057
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,580
Yeah, someone else, yes.

1058
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:57,100
I was gonna say, how would Hegel explain

1059
00:52:57,100 --> 00:52:59,420
the kind of experience that, like,

1060
00:53:01,020 --> 00:53:03,500
you just go, like, more and more wrong,

1061
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:06,620
for example, like, if I choose the wrong path

1062
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,780
of argument in an essay, well, I believe that's true.

1063
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,740
And I just go, like, more and more wrong,

1064
00:53:11,740 --> 00:53:13,180
like, just the wrong, and.

1065
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:18,380
It's logically independent or orthogonal

1066
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:20,300
to what Hegel is doing in the phenomenology of spirit.

1067
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,580
The phenomenology of spirit is not psychology.

1068
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:24,940
This is not a claim of a human psychology

1069
00:53:24,940 --> 00:53:28,180
or what human psychology does in respect,

1070
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:30,220
in the face of error.

1071
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:34,620
It's a logical claim about the nature of consciousness.

1072
00:53:34,620 --> 00:53:37,420
So you might not care that you're wrong,

1073
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,540
but consciousness has such ducts.

1074
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:43,040
And that's why, in general, consciousness,

1075
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,060
when it discovers an incoherence

1076
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:49,180
in its own self-conception alters it.

1077
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:50,620
And one way of seeing that,

1078
00:53:50,660 --> 00:53:52,980
although this is not the theme of the phenomenology,

1079
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:56,220
is this story is played out in history,

1080
00:53:56,220 --> 00:53:58,540
but it's not the topic of the phenomenology.

1081
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,540
The key thing is that in absolute knowing

1082
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,500
at the end of the book,

1083
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:06,000
Hegel says spirit releases itself into history,

1084
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,080
which means that all of this does happen in history,

1085
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,900
but it doesn't happen in this order.

1086
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:12,860
And that is not the topic of this book.

1087
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,180
So these shapes of consciousness

1088
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:15,900
are historically real.

1089
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,840
And historically, when human societies recognize

1090
00:54:19,880 --> 00:54:21,720
that their conception of their relationship

1091
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,320
to the world is incoherent,

1092
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:26,560
they change, not immediately.

1093
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:29,360
Sometimes they persist in the contradiction.

1094
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:33,960
And then the undoing of that contradiction

1095
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:37,020
can involve massive historical change.

1096
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,180
For instance, my country is founded on the idea

1097
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,120
that all men are created equal.

1098
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,680
It was also founded on economic side

1099
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,400
and the exploitation of enslaved people.

1100
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,560
That's a contradiction.

1101
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,720
You can either think of that contradiction

1102
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,240
as having worked out in the Civil War

1103
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:53,480
as we're still not being worked out.

1104
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:56,040
But that's a perfect example of a Hegelian contradiction

1105
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:57,480
worked out historically.

1106
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,360
Yeah.

1107
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,200
Does consciousness know a symbol

1108
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,600
of becoming spirit in its beginning?

1109
00:55:02,600 --> 00:55:03,440
No.

1110
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:06,640
Or like, so it only goes to my guess.

1111
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,640
It gets some anticipation later on.

1112
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:13,200
Later on, it's like you can see in the distance this thing

1113
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,280
and it's like, that would be really awesome.

1114
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:17,480
Early on, consciousness, as we'll see next week

1115
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,240
when we talk about the first shape of consciousness,

1116
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:22,040
the first shape of consciousness knows one thing.

1117
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:22,880
This.

1118
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,880
What's the grounds of the movement itself?

1119
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,440
The grounds of the movement itself is the

1120
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:37,680
the self-reputation of consciousness.

1121
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:38,520
Yeah.

1122
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:41,120
What limits consciousness from knowing the being?

1123
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:44,520
Nothing.

1124
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:47,560
What limits consciousness from knowing the in itself

1125
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:51,640
is all of its conceptions of the in itself and knowing

1126
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,480
short of absolute no.

1127
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:59,320
So one way of thinking about the relationship

1128
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:02,160
between Hegel and Kant is Kant thinks

1129
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,600
that at least theoretically things themselves

1130
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,720
are unavailable to us.

1131
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:09,660
Hegel thinks nothing is unavailable to us.

1132
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:12,060
There might be facts that are unknowable to us,

1133
00:56:12,060 --> 00:56:14,300
there might be details of my particular objects,

1134
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:16,260
but there's nothing that is structurally

1135
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:18,740
or logically unknowable to us.

1136
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:21,060
Everything is in principle available

1137
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,300
or transparent to spirit.

1138
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,700
Consciousness and science of consciousness

1139
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,580
both are events?

1140
00:56:29,580 --> 00:56:32,180
No, because events happen in time.

1141
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:35,100
None of these, the phenomenology of spirit

1142
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,860
is not about any events, it's not about any times.

1143
00:56:37,860 --> 00:56:40,660
Hegel illustrates various shapes of consciousness

1144
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,580
with historical references.

1145
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,180
But people who focus on those things

1146
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:48,060
and take the phenomenology to be about them

1147
00:56:48,060 --> 00:56:50,060
in the words of my friend Marcus Gabriel

1148
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,180
are expositing Hegel's examples, not Hegel.

1149
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:55,300
They are scholars of Hegel's metaphors,

1150
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:56,900
not of the phenomenology of spirit.

1151
00:56:56,900 --> 00:56:57,740
Yeah, in the back.

1152
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:01,300
Yes, last section, paragraph 26.

1153
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:05,620
There's two instances I, well, we were talking about that

1154
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:07,820
in the book, but I'm not going to emphasize

1155
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:10,100
how different from a point of decision between science

1156
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:12,380
or the knowledge, apparent knowledge,

1157
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:14,300
what true knowledge that we declare,

1158
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,020
because it's like both and I guess not.

1159
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:20,060
But like in time, science declares-

1160
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:21,700
Just could you just tell me where in some instances?

1161
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:23,740
Yeah, science declares its beam to me its power,

1162
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:25,900
but I'm sure knowing this as much as fuel

1163
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:29,380
to the fact that it is, and it gives out the assurance

1164
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:31,740
that science counts as nothing,

1165
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,500
so what does it mean, the science declares its beam

1166
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:36,420
on the standard and-

1167
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:40,340
Oh, so the idea is science says I am science.

1168
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:42,460
So I know stuff.

1169
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,420
But the person who doesn't have science,

1170
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:46,100
but thinks they have science, can say the same thing.

1171
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,500
They can give the same little speech,

1172
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,660
because they both are.

1173
00:57:50,700 --> 00:57:51,540
Yes.

1174
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,180
This is for the study of study of the last question,

1175
00:57:54,180 --> 00:57:56,940
but does Hegel ever provide an explicit justification

1176
00:57:56,940 --> 00:57:59,700
of how we can be certain that the conditions

1177
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,860
for this whole progression are all identical to success?

1178
00:58:02,860 --> 00:58:06,020
How does he know that nature sort of never intervenes

1179
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,340
in the progression of consciousness,

1180
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,340
and that can all just sort of contain

1181
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,620
within consciousness itself?

1182
00:58:10,620 --> 00:58:14,260
Okay, so that would be a problem if this were a description

1183
00:58:14,260 --> 00:58:17,300
of a concrete process happening in reality.

1184
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:21,260
This is a purely logical or conceptual account.

1185
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:23,980
So the word about nature intervening

1186
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:27,980
or nature not cooperating is no more a problem

1187
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:30,380
than this for a logic textbook.

1188
00:58:30,380 --> 00:58:32,620
If you said, how do you know that if P

1189
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,580
then Q, then Q, nature might intervene.

1190
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:39,020
Nature might, just at the moment you're concluding

1191
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:42,540
that Q of earth, queen, or meteor might happen.

1192
00:58:42,540 --> 00:58:43,500
That's not a problem here.

1193
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:46,820
That might be a problem for Hegel's theory of history.

1194
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:48,060
When you get to Hegel's history,

1195
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:50,220
Hegel's theory of history might have the problem

1196
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,780
that well a meteor could come and not wipe out humanity.

1197
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,460
I don't think it does have that problem,

1198
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:58,580
but it is standardly read as having that problem.

1199
00:58:58,580 --> 00:58:59,420
Yeah.

1200
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:02,900
Just from that hour or on science stuff,

1201
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,220
a word is mentioned in the time that I don't understand,

1202
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,540
it's the word imitation.

1203
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,380
What's that?

1204
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,340
Is that something like a reference to your way

1205
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:11,460
of understanding the world?

1206
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:14,340
Imitation is just something that pretends

1207
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:16,180
to be something that it isn't.

1208
00:59:16,180 --> 00:59:20,340
So, you know, there's imitation cheese,

1209
00:59:20,340 --> 00:59:22,260
which is not cheese.

1210
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:24,220
It's like made out of non-dairy products.

1211
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:27,100
There's imitation crab, which is not crab.

1212
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:28,900
It's all of the most repulsive,

1213
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:32,820
inedible parts of some fish that's been reformed

1214
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:35,180
to make it look like crab and die.

1215
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,100
What is intimation?

1216
00:59:36,100 --> 00:59:37,500
Oh, intimation, sorry.

1217
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,380
Oh, intimation.

1218
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:44,360
Yeah, so an intimation is like when you kind of vaguely

1219
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,620
sense that something is gonna happen,

1220
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:51,300
but you can't really say exactly what.

1221
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,620
So many of you have an intimation

1222
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:54,940
that this class is gonna become

1223
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:56,700
completely incomprehensible.

1224
00:59:57,060 --> 01:00:00,220
That's more than an intimation,

1225
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:03,580
because I've more or less told you that that's gonna happen.

1226
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:04,420
Yeah?

1227
01:00:04,420 --> 01:00:05,260
I'll ask you a question.

1228
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:08,540
What is the word natural at to natural?

1229
01:00:08,540 --> 01:00:10,140
Good question.

1230
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:12,220
I think what it means,

1231
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:17,220
I think it's supposed to justify

1232
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:20,860
why we start with the shape of consciousness

1233
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:21,860
that we've given.

1234
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:24,240
Namely, it's the most immediate

1235
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:27,040
or least sophisticated possible shape of consciousness.

1236
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,320
On the other hand, I mean, sorry,

1237
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,760
I didn't ignore that, that's wrong.

1238
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,080
What it means by calling that natural consciousness

1239
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,940
is that that is the position

1240
01:00:36,940 --> 01:00:39,720
of philosophically untrue to common sense.

1241
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:42,580
That's the natural starting point to think about knowledge.

1242
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,840
I have a being, there's some other beings,

1243
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:48,120
they're distinct from me.

1244
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:49,280
I've gotta know about them.

1245
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:50,200
How do I do that?

1246
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:52,000
That leads you into the whole problem.

1247
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:53,840
Yeah?

1248
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:58,840
So, sorry, I'm trying to find a way to frame the phone.

1249
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,600
So is there a sort of an original point of,

1250
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:07,240
so the being for, the being in itself,

1251
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,600
it seems to me it's for Hegel.

1252
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:13,400
It's already at any rate sort of being schematized

1253
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,400
already by the consciousness

1254
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,760
so that it can make its presence into,

1255
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,680
you know, a relationship in knowing.

1256
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:23,800
So, which it's sort of,

1257
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:28,000
a schematization is already a sort of,

1258
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:33,000
a sort of derivation from the original being in itself.

1259
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:39,320
So what you're right about is being in itself here

1260
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:42,560
is the in itself of the object of knowledge,

1261
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:43,840
or the object of consciousness,

1262
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,320
which means that the in itself,

1263
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,440
insofar as we cannot be conscious of it,

1264
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,920
is not on the table.

1265
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:52,800
But remember, the topic here is, what can we know?

1266
01:01:52,800 --> 01:01:55,440
So the in itself, insofar as we can't be conscious of it,

1267
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:58,040
is definitely not a topic for epistemology.

1268
01:01:58,040 --> 01:02:01,320
Secondly, knowledge here, I just, I keep trying to,

1269
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,480
knowledge is extremely general.

1270
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,000
It's what, it is the relationship of consciousness

1271
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:06,840
to a topic.

1272
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,840
So if we can't be conscious of it,

1273
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,120
this in itself that isn't even,

1274
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,840
isn't the in itself of the object of consciousness.

1275
01:02:15,840 --> 01:02:16,680
If the in itself,

1276
01:02:16,680 --> 01:02:18,440
that can't even be an object of consciousness,

1277
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,160
how do we even talk about it?

1278
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:21,800
So it's just not relevant.

1279
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:25,000
So the starting point, the original point of,

1280
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,000
of dialect is when you take a little movement,

1281
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,640
it's already in a mode of knowing, sort of.

1282
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:32,560
Exactly, it's all of this is within a thought.

1283
01:02:32,560 --> 01:02:33,920
We're not talking,

1284
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,560
the phenomena does not start with beings.

1285
01:02:37,560 --> 01:02:41,040
It starts with the relationship of consciousness to beings.

1286
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,400
In particular, it starts with the relationship

1287
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:46,040
of consciousness to beings as conceived by consciousness.

1288
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:48,400
Everything is within a thought.

1289
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:49,800
I'll see you next week.
