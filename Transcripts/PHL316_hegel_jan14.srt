1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,000
So the project of the phenomenology of spirit

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,560
is to determine what knowledge is or what knowing is.

3
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,800
And the reason that we want to do that

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,720
is to determine whether knowledge of the absolute

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:20,840
is possible or whether, as Kant argued in the first critique,

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,680
the absolute lies beyond the limits, at least,

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,200
of theoretical knowledge we're going to be in.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,760
Now, what the absolute is for Hegel

9
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,280
is something that it's going to take us a while to see.

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,640
And there's kind of no, I don't think

11
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:40,080
it's probably helpful to say the Hegelian formula of what

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,840
the absolute idea is before we get there.

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,720
So the short version is it's what

14
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:48,680
Hegel will call the absolute idea at the end of the logic.

15
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,800
Before we get there, you can think of it as God.

16
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,120
A little bit better, you can think of it as Spinoza's God.

17
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,720
A little bit better, you can think of it

18
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,920
as the unconditioned in Kant.

19
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,560
And even better than that would be

20
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,080
if you thought of it as neither subjective, so neither

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,120
a mind nor nature, but something that's both.

22
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:15,200
What the hell that means, you'll see.

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,280
So Hegel then discusses what I call

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,960
the meta-epistemological problem, a problem about how

25
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,640
we determine what the correct epistemology is,

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,800
what the correct account of what knowing is.

27
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:33,480
And the problem is, how do we decide,

28
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,840
not just between different knowledge claims,

29
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,240
but between different epistemologies?

30
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,920
So if I claim to know that Fargo is

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,520
the capital of North Dakota, and you claim that I don't know

32
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:47,640
that because it's false, but we share the same epistemology,

33
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:53,240
namely looking at an atlas, then that's not a big problem.

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,040
But if you and I have different epistemologies,

35
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,560
and I claim I know that God exists

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,840
on the basis of immediate religious state,

37
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:03,920
then you say, well, you couldn't know whether God exists,

38
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,520
because the proposition God exists appears nowhere

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,760
in natural science.

40
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,440
Well, first of all, we both have really shitty epistemologies.

41
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,480
But secondly, and arguably the second one

42
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,200
is worse than the first, there's no way

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:22,360
to adjudicate which of us has the correct conception

44
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,640
of knowledge on the basis of which we could then

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,040
adjudicate who knows what they claim to be.

46
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:39,400
So Hegel relates this to the problem of the criterion,

47
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,760
which was originally formulated by sextus empiricus

48
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,400
in the outlines of purinism.

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,600
And the problem of the criterion takes the form of a dilemma.

50
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,080
Either we have some can someone makes a knowledge claim,

51
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,080
and they have a certain conception of knowledge.

52
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,840
They claim to know that God exists

53
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,360
on the basis of immediate religious faith.

54
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,040
We either apply their own conception of knowledge,

55
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,280
in which case trivially, their knowledge claim

56
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,840
is going to be vindicated.

57
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,620
So if we either, for each person's

58
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:18,360
conception of knowledge, we simply apply it to itself,

59
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,000
everyone's going to pass that task.

60
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,240
The other possibility is that we apply

61
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,160
a different conception of knowledge.

62
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,480
The problem with that is that looks question made.

63
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,880
Someone says, I know that God exists

64
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,000
on the basis of immediate religious faith.

65
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,840
And then I say, well, that epistemology

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,960
doesn't justify that knowledge claim,

67
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,680
because that epistemology fails the criterion

68
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,040
of my epistemology.

69
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,920
Namely, you know those and only those things

70
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:48,520
that appear as propositions in empirical natural science.

71
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,580
I've banked the question against the person

72
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,920
who has a different criterion of knowledge

73
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,600
or a different conception of what knowledge is.

74
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,760
So Hegel's solution is a version of the first one,

75
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,360
where we apply some conception of knowledge to itself.

76
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,160
But the difference is he thinks that these conceptions

77
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,360
of knowledge, or concepts, as he calls them

78
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,680
in the phenomenology, typically do not agree with themselves.

79
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,960
When you look at them, what you see

80
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,880
is their conception of knowledge and their conception

81
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:25,980
of the object of knowledge don't agree.

82
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,380
And now you might think that's very artificial.

83
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,020
But actually, if you look at a lot of epistemology,

84
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:34,380
certainly in the history of philosophy,

85
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,500
you'll find it is very often these problems do arise.

86
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:41,500
If you read Locke, it's very unclear how Locke

87
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,540
thinks he knows all of the things he thinks he knows,

88
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,380
because he thinks he knows everything

89
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:49,660
he knows through sensation, ultimately.

90
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,200
But that he claims to know that God exists,

91
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,800
that there are substances with powers that are extended,

92
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,400
or at least have primary qualities that

93
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,600
resemble our ideas of them.

94
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,640
And it's very unclear from Locke how he could know any

95
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,280
of the things he claims to know.

96
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,160
Likewise, the My Little Toy epistemology,

97
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,480
the person who knows only the propositions enumerated

98
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,400
in the empirical natural sciences, which

99
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,880
here's one of the propositions.

100
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,560
Here's a proposition that occurs nowhere

101
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,200
in empirical natural science.

102
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,780
You know all and only those things

103
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:24,300
that are stated in the empirical natural science.

104
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,460
But their own epistemology, they don't

105
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,580
know what they claim to know.

106
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:33,000
So Hegel's solution, which is to examine

107
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,140
the internal coherence of these concepts of knowledge,

108
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:42,220
is more productive than it might at first appear.

109
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,900
So what Hegel is going to then engage in

110
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,400
is an imminent or internal critique

111
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,400
of various conceptions of knowledge,

112
00:05:51,400 --> 00:06:00,680
or as he calls them, forms or shapes of consciousness.

113
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,760
Gestadens bÃ¼liskes.

114
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,600
Now they're imminent because we are not

115
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,720
going to impose our own criteria of knowledge

116
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,440
on these shapes of consciousness.

117
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,100
We're going to examine them purely internally

118
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,840
and see whether their conception of knowledge

119
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,720
matches their conception of the object of knowledge.

120
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,460
That is to say, whether you could

121
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:25,060
know, according to their conception of what knowledge

122
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,940
is, the object of knowledge according to their conception

123
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,580
of the object of knowledge.

124
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:36,740
Now Hegel adopts for expository or analytic purposes

125
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,060
a kind of abstract model of what consciousness is.

126
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,860
And that is we have consciousness,

127
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:54,620
we have an object, which we call the in itself,

128
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:59,540
because it isn't reducible to its being for consciousness,

129
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,140
and we have the relationship of that object for consciousness,

130
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,300
how it is for consciousness, which

131
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,620
is another way of describing it.

132
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,980
Now a few comments about this.

133
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,060
One, you might say, but wait, aren't there

134
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,900
conceptions of knowledge on which consciousness knows itself?

135
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,140
Absolutely.

136
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:25,700
But we're going to unfold those in the course

137
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,940
of the phenomenon.

138
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,820
So we start with what Hegel thinks

139
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:35,100
of as the most immediate natural conception of knowledge, one

140
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,380
in which you know something that is distinct from

141
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,420
and irreducible to your knowledge of it.

142
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:42,460
That's what Hegel characterizes as consciousness.

143
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:53,900
Now the question is going to be, does this relation,

144
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:58,340
as consciousness conceive of it, constitute knowledge

145
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,380
of this object as consciousness conceives it?

146
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:04,660
Another question is, where are these conceptions coming from?

147
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:09,260
They're coming from consciousness itself.

148
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,580
Or as Hegel will say, consciousness

149
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:14,180
is the concept of itself.

150
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,900
Consciousness has a conception of it.

151
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,860
That means in the ordinary sense of self-consciousness,

152
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:23,380
consciousness is self-conscious from the beginning

153
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,420
of the phenomenon.

154
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:28,620
In the ordinary sense of not only knowing objects,

155
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,980
but also having some conception of what you're

156
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,140
doing in knowing objects, who you are,

157
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,020
what knowledge is, what the object is,

158
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,740
self-consciousness is present from the very beginning.

159
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,220
Self-consciousness in Hegel's conception,

160
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,300
in the technical sense in which it emerges in the phenomenology,

161
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,540
refers to review on which what knowledge fundamentally

162
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,620
is, is self-consciousness, so that consciousness doesn't

163
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,140
fundamentally know an object.

164
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:56,940
It knows itself knowing an object.

165
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,820
So that we're not going to get to in this case.

166
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,460
You don't think that somehow consciousness

167
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,180
has no conception of itself.

168
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:06,900
Because if it did from the first page of the phenomenology,

169
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,820
the project would fail.

170
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:19,940
If this doesn't match this as consciousness conceives of it,

171
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,940
then this is not a way of knowing this

172
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,660
as consciousness conceives of it,

173
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:29,420
and this shape of consciousness contradicts it.

174
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:33,900
But now if this shape of consciousness contradicts itself,

175
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:39,140
the result is not what Hegel calls an abstract negation.

176
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:42,060
That is to say, we just give up on knowledge.

177
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:47,580
The result is what Hegel calls a determinate negation.

178
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,900
Or that is to say, a new shape of consciousness, which

179
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:57,340
is determinately, specifically, not this shape of consciousness.

180
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,700
And the new shape of consciousness,

181
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,060
if this is object one, object two

182
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,700
is the being of object one for consciousness.

183
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,740
So the idea is we have some conception of knowing.

184
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,780
We have some conception of the object of knowledge.

185
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,020
That turns out not to be a way of knowing that object.

186
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,700
So then what results from that is not, well,

187
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,380
let's just give up on knowing.

188
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,300
But oh, what we can know is objects

189
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:33,500
insofar as they can be for consciousness in this way.

190
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:39,060
And a very good example of this is,

191
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,300
in the beginning of the Transcendent of Critique of Pure

192
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:43,580
Reason, Kant's first view, this is

193
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,740
a kind of slightly hokey, big alien reading

194
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,940
of the beginning of the Critique of Pure Reason,

195
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,900
you could think of the first shape of consciousness

196
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,860
in the Critique of Pure Reason as transcendental realism.

197
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,220
What we know is things in themselves,

198
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,180
totally mind-dependent objects, and we

199
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,420
know them in their mind-dependent nature.

200
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,940
And we know them through their effects upon our sensibility.

201
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:06,580
And then the argument of the first critique

202
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,500
very early on in the Transcendental Aesthetic

203
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,300
is that that way of knowing, sensible cognition,

204
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,540
is not a way of knowing things in themselves.

205
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,080
So then the second shape of consciousness,

206
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,620
Kant's own view, Transcendental Idealism,

207
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,500
is we know the being of consciousness

208
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,500
of the first object for consciousness.

209
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,580
What we know is not things in themselves

210
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,700
via sensory cognition.

211
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,060
We know the being of them for sensory cognition.

212
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:35,100
That is to say, their appearance is sensory cognition.

213
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,900
So the second object is the being of the first object

214
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,900
for consciousness.

215
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,740
In this case, the appearing of things in themselves

216
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:43,420
to sensory cognition.

217
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,300
That's just an illustration.

218
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:50,540
So now we have a conception of how the phenomenology moves.

219
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,900
That is to say, how we go from one shape of consciousness

220
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,780
to the next.

221
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,940
A complete account would have to also include

222
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,260
an account of where we start.

223
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:01,780
But we're going to spend a lot of today talking about that.

224
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,340
So I'm going to bracket that for now.

225
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,740
Where does the phenomenology end?

226
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,460
The phenomenology will end.

227
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,580
Oh, we have some math.

228
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,620
All right.

229
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:29,860
The phenomenology will end when the relation of, let's say,

230
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,620
consciousness, although it won't be called consciousness

231
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,660
anymore, for reasons I'll go into,

232
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:47,980
or the relation of consciousness to the in itself,

233
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:52,780
where these things are so tightly identified

234
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,780
that no possible gap between being for itself

235
00:12:56,780 --> 00:13:00,180
and being for consciousness could possibly arise.

236
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,580
That is to say, where being in itself

237
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,740
is being for consciousness, and being for consciousness

238
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:08,380
is being for being in itself.

239
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:11,220
Now, there's various names for that that Hegel has.

240
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:17,180
One is, where truth becomes identical to certainty.

241
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:21,340
One of the names for the in itself is truth.

242
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,300
Another name for it is, another name

243
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:26,220
for being for consciousness is certainty.

244
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,300
So where truth and certainty are so closely identified

245
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,820
that none of the skeptical problems

246
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
that undermine forms of consciousness

247
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,660
could possibly arise.

248
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,580
The official name for this is absolute knowing.

249
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,740
That's where the book ends.

250
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,780
OK.

251
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:48,180
So the book ends with section absolute knowing,

252
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,420
or absolute knowledge, absolute citizen.

253
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,620
I've put it on the reading next week,

254
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,740
because although the idea of this class

255
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,660
is let's read all the parts of Hegel you can read,

256
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,740
I want you to also have a sense of what I'm sparing you.

257
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,340
So try to read absolute knowing.

258
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,300
You won't really succeed.

259
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:11,140
It's kind of unreadable.

260
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:15,300
Just a word further about reading in this class,

261
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:21,700
if I were you, I would expect to read every text,

262
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:25,820
every one of the readings in this class, three times.

263
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,900
Read it once, and you'll be like, what is going on?

264
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,380
I sort of a vague sense.

265
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,620
Read it a second time, you'll understand much better.

266
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:37,820
So the good news with Hegel is you do actually understand it

267
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,500
the more you read it.

268
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,620
Sometimes it won't feel that way.

269
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,900
Now the phenomenology of getting really into Hegel,

270
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,340
phenomenology in the ordinary sense of what it feels like,

271
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:50,700
is you're constantly understanding it better.

272
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,500
So you're tempted into the fallacy.

273
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,020
Eventually, I'll understand it all.

274
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:59,460
But constant improvement doesn't mean

275
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:02,220
that you'll ever reach any finite value,

276
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,900
because it might plateau.

277
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,180
This is my worry.

278
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,460
This is what keeps me up.

279
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,700
This is time.

280
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,100
This is staying to understanding.

281
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,060
And then actual understanding would be here.

282
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,940
But who knows?

283
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:20,140
But I'm constantly increasing every time I'm going up,

284
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,700
ever less.

285
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:26,340
So let me just say a few more things.

286
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,820
I forgot to say something about course mechanics.

287
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:35,100
My office hours this week are.

288
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:52,100
Wednesday 4.30 to 6, and Friday 3 to 4.

289
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,420
My office hours will vary from week to week,

290
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:58,180
because there's all these different job searches going

291
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,620
on in the philosophy department.

292
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,260
And I have to attend some of them.

293
00:16:02,260 --> 00:16:05,940
Some of you have asked me about secondary literature.

294
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:08,860
My attitude towards secondary literature

295
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,340
is the attitude towards those of you who have cool Gen X

296
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:17,180
parents probably have towards your doing drugs, which

297
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,940
is they tell you, do not do them.

298
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:23,140
But if you were to do drugs, your parents

299
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,220
would give you advice on how to do them safely.

300
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,260
They would tell you, OK, don't do heroin.

301
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,900
But if you could smoke a little weed,

302
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:33,140
we're not going to throw you out of the house.

303
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,580
So my advice is do not do drugs.

304
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,420
Do not read secondary literature.

305
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,980
But if you're going to, I would prefer

306
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,860
you do it in a controlled, safe environment.

307
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,940
And you do the marijuana equivalent of Hegel

308
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,740
secondary literature rather than the fentanyl equivalent.

309
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:51,060
I won't even tell you what the fentanyl equivalent of Hegel

310
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,460
secondary literature is, because I don't

311
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,860
want you to know about it.

312
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,340
So if you come to me and you say,

313
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:00,020
stay, I am going to read secondary literature.

314
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,220
I'll try to talk you out of it.

315
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,940
But if I fail to, I'll give you some advice on what to read.

316
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,700
So another analogy.

317
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,940
Reading the secondary literature,

318
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:13,900
it's the older version of using AI.

319
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,420
So why is it bad to use AI?

320
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,820
Do you learn nothing?

321
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,860
Are all the answers on Claude or Chachupiti wrong?

322
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,780
No, you can learn stuff from that.

323
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:28,460
But if you use AI, you do not develop your own capacities

324
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,580
till now.

325
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:31,260
And that is what an education is about.

326
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,820
An education is not about us telling you stuff

327
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,140
that you didn't know.

328
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,260
You could do that on your own.

329
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:40,420
An education is about developing your own capacities.

330
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,260
And when you use AI, you do not develop your own capacities.

331
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:48,340
The aim of learning is not that it be known the P.

332
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,460
It is for me to know the P. So when

333
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,620
you read secondary literature, what you do not develop

334
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:57,540
is your own capacity to read and engage

335
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,500
in philosophical text.

336
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,460
That was my little speech about why I hate AI

337
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,620
and why I hate secondary literature.

338
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:10,860
So another thing that I want to emphasize,

339
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:15,340
the phenomenology of spirit is a conceptual development.

340
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,900
So we talk about a process or a development

341
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:20,100
in phenomenology of spirit, a sequence

342
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,980
of shapes of consciousness.

343
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:27,180
This is not a historical or temporal sequence.

344
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:32,740
Although these shapes can be and are exhibited historically,

345
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:35,540
they correspond, to varying degrees,

346
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,620
to conceptions of knowing, conceptions

347
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:41,500
of the relation of the subject to the object that

348
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,660
have been present historically in different periods of history.

349
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:49,660
Now there's a distinction in the phenomenology,

350
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,740
which will come up numerous times

351
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:56,740
in this class between what is for consciousness

352
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,380
and what is for us.

353
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,780
I'm looking for a special chalk that I've already lost.

354
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,740
Under the whiteboard.

355
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:10,820
Under the whiteboard.

356
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,700
Is that not it?

357
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,300
No, it is not.

358
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:18,700
So I think I need the glasses to find the chalk.

359
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,380
This will be sorted out later.

360
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,860
So there's a distinction in the phenomenology

361
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,900
between what is for consciousness.

362
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:32,300
And what is for us.

363
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:40,660
Sometimes, Hegel uses the term in itself.

364
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,820
So that marks the distinction between what

365
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:46,940
a given shape of consciousness is aware of.

366
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:47,500
You're counted.

367
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:53,300
What is imminent to a given shape of consciousness?

368
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,900
What a given shape of consciousness

369
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,220
is aware of of itself?

370
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,420
What is for us is something that we

371
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:01,420
understand about that shape of consciousness,

372
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,100
but it doesn't understand about itself.

373
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,620
So we, as the readers of the phenomenology,

374
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:08,420
sometimes called the phenomenological observer,

375
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:12,420
will note certain things about shapes of consciousness.

376
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,780
That's not going to work.

377
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,620
That's kind of stupid.

378
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,740
Hegel never said that.

379
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,140
Or this sort of is like a previous shape of consciousness.

380
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,060
Or you can tell that this is going to be a problem.

381
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,900
Or consciousness will face this problem.

382
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:30,220
Those are not imminent remarks for consciousness.

383
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,540
So one other remark.

384
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,540
I talked about this a little bit last time,

385
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:39,620
and I felt like what I did so really unclearly.

386
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:46,260
Hegel uses, I'll just encompass the questions in a second.

387
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,300
Hegel is very typical of Hegel.

388
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,460
So there's this book called the Hegel dictionary.

389
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,260
If you were to read secondary literature,

390
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:55,260
which you should not do, you might be aware of it.

391
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:58,740
And the joke about the Hegel dictionary is every entry,

392
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,100
ultimately, if you read all the entries,

393
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:03,900
they ultimately just go back to idea or spirit.

394
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,980
Because everything is just another synonym

395
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:07,380
for idea or spirit.

396
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:12,140
So in Hegel, there's this problem of massive,

397
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,780
this multiplication of terms that all

398
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:16,380
refer to the same thing, but they mean different things.

399
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:19,380
Or there are different modes of presentation of one

400
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:20,940
underlying reality.

401
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:35,940
So consciousness, self-consciousness, reason,

402
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:40,060
and spirit in the phenomenology really all

403
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,060
refer to the same thing.

404
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,060
But they refer to that underlay.

405
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:47,420
They refer to spirit.

406
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,900
They refer to different grades or degrees

407
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,660
of that thing's conception of itself.

408
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:59,820
So that means they are all spirit in itself,

409
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,420
but they are not yet spirit for itself.

410
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,180
Spirit is in and for itself fully and totally

411
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,420
only at the end of the book.

412
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,820
Only at the end of the book are we

413
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,620
talking about a shape of consciousness

414
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:18,220
that is fully and completely aware of what it is.

415
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,900
But all along, they're in itself spirit.

416
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:25,860
So in itself sometimes means something like implicitly.

417
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,380
Well, for itself means explicitly.

418
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,060
Sorry, the exact opposite.

419
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,900
Now, that means when Hegel refers to something,

420
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,980
some shape of consciousness as reason,

421
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:49,380
he's referring to it at the highest level of actualization

422
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,780
that it is aware of itself.

423
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:57,980
So reason is spirit in itself that is not yet spirit.

424
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,380
Sorry, spirit in itself that is not yet spirit for itself.

425
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,020
It's only for itself reason.

426
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,820
Now, it's also for itself consciousness

427
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,100
and self-consciousness.

428
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,140
But Hegel doesn't call it that because, or doesn't usually

429
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,980
call it that because he wants to draw attention

430
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,340
that he's talking about this thing at a level where

431
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,700
it's aware of itself as reason.

432
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:23,620
These give rise.

433
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:26,260
And of course, between these is religion.

434
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:29,940
But I'm skipping that because some of you

435
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,440
at some point in this class are going

436
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,300
to have this lingering suspicion that this is just

437
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:37,380
all super poopy religious stuff.

438
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,260
And I'm trying to delay as long as possible

439
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,540
the anti-religious reaction to Hegel.

440
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,300
So I'm just going to skip the religion thing.

441
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,580
So when Hegel talks about reason,

442
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,660
he's talking about, in some sense, the same entity.

443
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:52,740
That's not the right word.

444
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,860
The same thing, also not the right word.

445
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:58,300
The same phenomenon as consciousness, self-consciousness,

446
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:03,220
and spirit, but at a lower level of its conception

447
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:06,140
of itself, of its understanding of itself as what it is.

448
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:08,660
So the process of the phenomenology of spirit

449
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:12,780
is consciousness coming to itself as spirit,

450
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,760
or spirit in itself becoming spirit in and for itself,

451
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:19,420
consciousness becoming fully and completely

452
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:22,300
aware of itself as spirit.

453
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,300
OK.

454
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,580
Questions about this.

455
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,060
Yes.

456
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,660
I'm still stumbling a little bit over the fact

457
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,100
that in the first distinction between what

458
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,900
is for consciousness and what is for us or in itself,

459
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,180
how in itself and for us can mean the same thing.

460
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,860
For me, they mean the opposite.

461
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,180
What is for me, I'm opposing what the object is for me.

462
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,740
I'm opposing to be different from what it is in itself.

463
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,020
Yes.

464
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,740
So OK.

465
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:57,980
So OK, good.

466
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:06,620
So what Hegel means by calling what's for us in itself

467
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,660
is that this is what consciousness is only

468
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,260
implicitly.

469
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,620
What it really is is something that isn't aware of.

470
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,980
Yeah.

471
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:27,460
So let me take a non-Hegelian example.

472
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:39,340
You might say the Renaissance doesn't realize

473
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:44,860
that what it is is the dissolution of Catholic era.

474
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,340
This is a full example.

475
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:49,340
But in itself, that's what it is.

476
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:51,580
It is this thing that's a better example.

477
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,740
Socrates, Hegel actually thinks, the appearance of Socrates

478
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,260
within Athenian society is the destruction

479
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,420
of Athenian society.

480
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,100
Once you have Socrates, the form of life

481
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,740
that is classical Athens can survive.

482
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,340
So Socrates is in himself the end

483
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,900
of the Athenian form of life.

484
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,700
But he's not that for himself.

485
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:16,860
That's why he's so surprised they want to put him to death.

486
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:19,460
He's not like, I'm bringing it all to an end, guys.

487
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,180
Because if he was, then they'd be like,

488
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,420
well, we have to kill you.

489
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,000
So there's a distinction between what

490
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,320
something is in itself implicitly,

491
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,400
but not yet if it's developed and realized for.

492
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:35,240
And what we as the observers can see on who knows what grounds,

493
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,000
it will eventually become and become

494
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,440
aware of itself explicitly as.

495
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
There was another one.

496
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,840
Yes.

497
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:47,080
Can we say consciousness and knowledge or experience?

498
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,280
No.

499
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,200
So experience, the technical meaning of experience in Hegel

500
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,720
is the process.

501
00:26:54,720 --> 00:27:00,480
It's this.

502
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,560
It's one shape of consciousness undermining itself

503
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,840
and being replaced by an object.

504
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,520
That's what experience is.

505
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,960
So this, consciousness of an object,

506
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,120
is not technically what Hegel means by experience.

507
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:13,600
Yeah.

508
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,680
So just back to movie star twist, is that right?

509
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:22,800
So you said initially that knowing is often

510
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:27,560
a conflict with consciousness, perceive of the object.

511
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,440
Can you elaborate on that?

512
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,400
Because that's two kinds of a relation.

513
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,280
And if consciousness perceive of the object,

514
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,080
wouldn't that also be knowing?

515
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,600
Yeah, OK.

516
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,960
So first of all, I just want to note, no,

517
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,760
and this is relevant to the beginning of the book,

518
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,160
self-certainty, your sense of certainty.

519
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,160
So if this chalk is supposed to not get all over,

520
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,720
it means the pot is not succeeding.

521
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,200
It's because you wait for it.

522
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,560
It's probably because I wait.

523
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,600
It's probably my fault.

524
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,840
So knowing here is an incredible,

525
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,280
that's a very, very general term.

526
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:10,360
So we're not assuming at the beginning of the phenomenology

527
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,000
that knowing is anything like you would normally

528
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,800
assume in philosophy.

529
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,480
So it doesn't have a propositional object.

530
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:21,240
It isn't true justified belief.

531
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,560
It isn't opposed to illusion.

532
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,520
It isn't opposed to mere opinion or belief.

533
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,440
In sensuous certainty, just to anticipate,

534
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,160
knowing is just, sensuous certainty can't really

535
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:35,080
say this, but it's just sensuously

536
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,480
apprehending something.

537
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,200
This is knowing.

538
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,440
That's knowing.

539
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:44,440
Now that means that knowing in its most general sense

540
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:47,960
is just the being of an object for consciousness.

541
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,440
And so before we get, Hegel will develop

542
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,600
over the course of phenomenology notions of knowledge

543
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,040
that look more like what we normally

544
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,000
talk about in epistemology.

545
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,960
But at the very beginning, it's just

546
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,120
whether this can be an object of consciousness.

547
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,000
Yeah.

548
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,400
So for consciousness, consciousness

549
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:10,960
cannot see its own developments.

550
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,720
It's only from the standpoint of for us

551
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,120
that I can see the whole program.

552
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,840
At the beginning.

553
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,360
Yes.

554
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:18,440
Eventually, consciousness will become self-conscious

555
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:21,720
or aware of its development in the phenomenology.

556
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,080
We won't get there.

557
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,080
Yeah.

558
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,960
I want to clarify imminence, because, for example,

559
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:33,080
in your example, if Socrates himself is not aware of it

560
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,960
or himself, he's not aware of the fact

561
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,520
that he's a distraction of being in society,

562
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:42,000
then the fact that Socrates is such a distraction

563
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,560
would still be imminent, because it's not?

564
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:49,840
If you said it in the courtroom in which Socrates

565
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,320
is being tried, no.

566
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:56,200
But it would be imminent if you could,

567
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,160
as a Hegelian philosopher, figure out

568
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,360
the underlying structure of Athenian society

569
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:07,840
and then show that it cannot allow someone like Socrates

570
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,960
within it and that once you even have

571
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,800
the possibility of someone like Socrates,

572
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,640
it's no longer stable.

573
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,880
And that, therefore, historically destroys the Greek city

574
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:23,400
state and give rise eventually to the Roman form of life,

575
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,200
then you would have made explicit

576
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,120
and you would have done so purely imminently

577
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,560
within, so to speak, the logic of these different historically

578
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:35,000
determined shapes of life that Socrates

579
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,600
is the end of the Athenian society.

580
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,200
But that was merely an illustration.

581
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:40,960
I know, but in that case, it's not

582
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,160
imminent for Socrates, but it's imminent for the Athenian

583
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,360
society.

584
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:48,200
It can be developed imminently, even

585
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:51,800
if the people in that historical period are not aware of it.

586
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,640
Or in other ways, we're getting way ahead of ourselves.

587
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,840
History for Hegel is the process of contradictions

588
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,360
in themselves being contradictions for themselves.

589
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,320
That is to say, implicit contradictions becoming

590
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,120
explicit contradictions, people being like, oh, wait.

591
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,120
How can it be that all men are created equal in a doubt

592
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
by the creator of certain inalienable rights

593
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,280
if our entire society is founded on the labor of enslave?

594
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,840
There was a question over here.

595
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:21,440
Yes.

596
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,840
It's just a simple question.

597
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:25,520
So for that process, is Hegel actually

598
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:28,960
being prescriptive or descriptive?

599
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,880
Descriptive.

600
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,360
Yes.

601
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,880
Yeah, just a follow-up.

602
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,280
So knowing just become the object of consciousness,

603
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:41,440
how can it be at all with itself or contradict itself?

604
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,440
We'll see.

605
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,400
We'll see.

606
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:43,880
Yes.

607
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,200
Is there some even more meta thing

608
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,880
that's supposed to happen to the observer

609
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,560
as they move through the shapes of consciousness?

610
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,360
Yes.

611
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,520
I'm not going to emphasize that in this class,

612
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:55,440
but I'll talk about this a little bit.

613
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,720
But you, who I've never read the farm culture before,

614
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,400
are supposed to have your consciousness raised

615
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:05,960
to the level of spirit over the course of reading this book.

616
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,240
So that is to say, you are all spirit in itself,

617
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,840
but not yet spirit for itself, because you are not

618
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,880
aware of what you are, namely spirit and what spirit is.

619
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:18,120
So one of the roles the phenomenology of spirit

620
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,520
is supposed to play is to get you off to that level.

621
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,640
Now, the reason it's supposed to get you off to that level

622
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,720
is so that you can then begin Hegelian science.

623
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,240
So the phenomenology of spirit is essentially,

624
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,040
in a certain way, it's the prerequisite

625
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,200
for all of Hegel's classes at the University of Berlin.

626
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,480
And in fact, at the beginning of the encyclopedia,

627
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,880
he says something to the effect of like,

628
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,720
what if you want to take this class without a prerequisite?

629
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,840
And the answer is like, you can do that,

630
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,800
but there are certain objections you're not allowed to raise.

631
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,880
And this book answers all the objections

632
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,720
you're not allowed to raise when you take logic

633
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,800
at the University of Berlin in the 1820s with Professor

634
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,000
Hegel.

635
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,240
Now, I should have said this last time, but I didn't say it.

636
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,560
So the way you should think about this class

637
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,880
is the professor is Hegel.

638
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,680
But in classic German professor style,

639
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,840
he doesn't show up to his own lectures.

640
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:15,360
He sends his assistant, me, to teach his lectures

641
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,360
and to run his office out.

642
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,080
So what we're trying to do is figure out

643
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:22,560
what Professor Hegel thought, but he never shows up.

644
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:26,120
So all we have is his books and the guy

645
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,320
that he's forced to teach his classes for several years.

646
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,600
And also in classic German professor style,

647
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,640
we'll then completely ignore me and never help me professionally.

648
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,080
OK, that's why.

649
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,960
So let's start sense certainty.

650
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:47,760
Before I begin, who found this reading hard?

651
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,000
Who found this reading very hard?

652
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,480
OK, just to give you an idea of the phenomenology,

653
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,360
this is by far the easiest thing in the phenomenology.

654
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,760
This is the thing that everyone kind of

655
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,280
feels comfortable teaching in the phenomenology.

656
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:12,560
So let us begin with the very opening of sense certainty.

657
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,360
Now, in classic style, I have to sit down and read the text.

658
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:29,320
It seems somehow sacrilegious to stand while reading.

659
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,840
I don't feel the need to cover my head when reading Hegel,

660
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,840
but OK.

661
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,400
OK, so let me just dive in.

662
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Knowing which is initially our object or immediately

663
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:54,120
can be nothing but immediate knowing of the immediate

664
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:56,360
or of what is.

665
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,760
Now, knowing is initially our object.

666
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,680
So we have to begin by talking about knowing.

667
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,560
We have to begin by talking about a shape of consciousness.

668
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:08,480
Now, this is the beginning.

669
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,280
That means we can't have arrived at this shape of consciousness

670
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,760
by something else.

671
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,680
So it can't have been mediated by a previous shape

672
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:22,320
of consciousness or anything else in knowing.

673
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,960
Now, mediation, this is a word you're

674
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,600
going to hear a million, million, million times in this class.

675
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,960
Just the simplest meaning of mediation,

676
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,800
I think just like the most general way

677
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:37,400
to think about it in Hegel, the place you should begin

678
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:41,680
is just mediation just means by means of something else

679
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,440
or by means of something else-ness.

680
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,000
But now notice, by means of something else

681
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,920
involves being one thing rather than another.

682
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:20,960
So mediation goes together with determinism.

683
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,760
So let me just give some examples.

684
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:26,360
Mediate knowing is knowing something

685
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,960
by knowing something else.

686
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,960
The classic example is inference.

687
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,880
If I know that Q, because I inferred it from P,

688
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:38,520
and if P then Q, then my knowledge of Q is immediate.

689
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:41,680
But that means if my knowledge is mediated,

690
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,280
there are other items of knowledge it is not.

691
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,800
It is determinantly Q rather than P or if P then Q.

692
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:52,320
For there to be immediate or inferential knowledge,

693
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:56,240
there has to be determinacy among the propositions.

694
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,560
Now, determinacy is being one thing rather than another.

695
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:10,800
Now, why does determinacy require mediation?

696
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,600
Because if I'm this rather than that, if I'm x rather than y,

697
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:22,160
I'm x partly by means of not being y.

698
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:26,840
So mediacy and determinacy go together.

699
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:31,120
Now, we have to start immediately.

700
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,680
Because this is the beginning, the beginning has to be immediate.

701
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,680
It can't be mediated by anything else.

702
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,960
But that means it also has to be indeterminate.

703
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:59,480
Now, what does it mean that we have to have an immediate knowing

704
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,080
which is initially our object, or immediately,

705
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,320
can be nothing but immediate knowing.

706
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,720
So we have to have an immediate conception of knowing,

707
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:11,400
not mediated by anything else.

708
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,000
If it were knowledge of something mediated,

709
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,440
then it wouldn't be an immediate conception of knowing.

710
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,760
Because in order for it to be knowledge of that mediated thing

711
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,760
or conceive of it, it would have to be knowledge of that thing

712
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,320
as opposed to something else.

713
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,640
And therefore, it would be mediated by that something else.

714
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:31,480
So we have to immediately start with immediate knowledge,

715
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:34,520
which is knowledge of the immediate.

716
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,000
Now, what is knowledge of the immediate?

717
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,960
It has to be knowledge of the indeterminate.

718
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,040
That is to say, we don't know this rather than that.

719
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,360
We just know this.

720
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,640
We don't know one object as opposed to another.

721
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:50,320
We just know the object.

722
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:54,600
Now, there's a theme in the sensuous certainty

723
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,320
that's going to be super important to this class

724
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:03,040
that I'm going to delay a little bit for the end of class.

725
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,560
And I'll just say it right now.

726
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,400
So Hegel assumes that what knowledge is

727
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,320
is knowledge of what is.

728
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,000
You know what is.

729
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,200
Just as you think about what is, you judge what is, et cetera.

730
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,480
So you can see this from the very first sentence

731
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,560
of the phenomenology.

732
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:27,480
It is natural supposition that in philosophy,

733
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,680
before one gets down to dealing with what is at issue,

734
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,720
namely, the actual cognition of what in truth is.

735
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,280
So basic assumption of phenomenology, what you know

736
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,360
is what is or what has been.

737
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,320
Now, you might ask, but don't I know things?

738
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:43,240
I can know shadows.

739
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:46,960
Not being is in a certain way a kind of being.

740
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:50,320
It's relevant or determinate with respect to being.

741
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,720
I want to set the being theme aside for now,

742
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,160
because I'll come back to it later,

743
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,760
and it's even more abstract than everything else.

744
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,440
So we start with an immediate form of knowledge.

745
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,840
That knowledge has to be immediate knowledge

746
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,040
or knowledge of the immediate.

747
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,080
Because otherwise, it would be mediated

748
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:11,320
by something else, some conception of its knowledge

749
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,960
as distinct from some other kind of knowledge,

750
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,200
and then it wouldn't be the beginning,

751
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,000
or knowledge of its object as distinct

752
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,800
from some other object, and it wouldn't be immediate.

753
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,560
So we know the first shape of consciousness

754
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,200
is immediate knowledge of the immediate.

755
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:30,320
It's just so it can't be knowing by mediation,

756
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:33,080
and it can't be knowledge of what is immediate.

757
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:33,800
Why?

758
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:37,240
Because knowledge determines what the object of knowledge is.

759
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:42,040
There has to be a fit between being for consciousness

760
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,880
and the object of consciousness.

761
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,800
So the being of consciousness, the being for consciousness

762
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,920
is immediacy, and the object is immediate.

763
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,040
We therefore are to alter nothing in the object

764
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,480
as it presents itself, and we must

765
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,280
keep our conceptualizing it apart

766
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,720
from our apprehending of it.

767
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,960
So that means both we as the phenomenological observer

768
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:07,120
simply have to observe what this immediate shape of knowing is.

769
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,600
It's not our job to alter it.

770
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,480
We have to just observe what this shape of consciousness

771
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,840
says about itself.

772
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:16,560
But likewise, this shape of consciousness

773
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:19,560
can't conceptualize its object.

774
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,480
Why?

775
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:25,200
Because conceptualizing something is determining it.

776
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:28,080
It's representing it as falling under one concept rather than

777
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:32,880
another, and that involves mediation.

778
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:37,320
Conceptualizing is mediate, so the immediate

779
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:39,360
has to be non-conceptual.

780
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,960
Let me just read a little bit from here.

781
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,920
The concrete content of sensuous certainty

782
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,120
permits itself to appear immediately

783
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,800
as the richest cognition.

784
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,760
So this shape of consciousness thinks of itself.

785
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,440
It's just immediate apprehension of the object.

786
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,360
It's sensuous because we're in consciousness,

787
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,760
and so we think the object is what determines what knowledge

788
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,320
is.

789
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,280
There's an object outside of consciousness

790
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:09,000
that is the thing that we have to map or match onto.

791
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,600
So it's sensuous, immediate circle.

792
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,600
And it thinks of itself as the richest form of cognition

793
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:23,960
because it lets the whole sensuous richness of the world

794
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,840
be what it is without bringing it under consciousness.

795
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:31,600
So Hegel is playing off this idea

796
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,960
that people had in this period that conceptualizing things

797
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,400
deprives them of their life or their richness.

798
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,840
Concepts, of course, are only about generalities.

799
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,200
I'll get to you in a second what things have in common.

800
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,160
And so when you conceptualize, you ignore the infinitely rich

801
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,120
particularity of every individual thing.

802
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:55,440
So this form of consciousness thinks,

803
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,360
I'm not doing any of that.

804
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,080
I'm not desiccating anything or generalizing.

805
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:04,440
I'm just purely apprehending everything immediately

806
00:43:04,440 --> 00:43:08,000
in its sensuous richness.

807
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,840
Indeed, there's a knowing of an infinite wealth

808
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,960
in which no limit is to be found,

809
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,280
whether we venture out into the reaches of space and time

810
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,960
as the place where that wealth extends itself

811
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,680
or when we take a piece out of this pontitude

812
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,680
divided and thereby delve into it.

813
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,240
So there's no limits because a limit would,

814
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,360
if there were a limit,

815
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,800
there would be something beyond the limit

816
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,840
that would involve mediation.

817
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,520
So there's no limits extensively.

818
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,160
There's no point beyond sensuous certainty.

819
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:36,600
And there's no limits within the object.

820
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,600
Sensuous certainty can dive further into the object,

821
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,800
look further and further and further into the object.

822
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,200
In addition, it appears as the most veritable

823
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,880
where it has not omitted anything from its object

824
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,160
because it isn't conceptually determining it.

825
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,720
It's not leaving out some of its details

826
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:54,040
and conceptualizing only some of them.

827
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,720
But rather has its complete entirety before itself.

828
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:04,160
However, this certainty in fact yields the most abstract

829
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,280
and the very poorest truth.

830
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,080
It expresses what it knows as this.

831
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,400
It is.

832
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,000
And its truth only contains the being of the object.

833
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,800
Now this is, I wanna separate the being issue

834
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,880
from the it issue for the following reason.

835
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:22,760
It can't really properly speaking be the case

836
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,960
that what sensuous certainty knows is it is or this is

837
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,880
because that it is is not immediate

838
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,800
because it involves a subject and a predicate.

839
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,800
And so it would involve the difference

840
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,320
between a subject and a predicate.

841
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,040
It would involve immediate relationship

842
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:39,760
between subject and predicate.

843
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,000
It would be determining the it as being.

844
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,520
So I wanna focus on it and then I'll come back to it.

845
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,600
So now what Hegel is saying, he's gonna argue

846
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:52,560
that contrary to what sensuous certainty thinks,

847
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:56,560
it doesn't know, it isn't the richest

848
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,640
and most variegated form of consciousness.

849
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,680
In fact, what it does is the most universal and abstract.

850
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,160
So just a little bit further.

851
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,160
For sensuous certainty, this is what is essential

852
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:11,720
and this pure being where this simple immediacy

853
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,400
constitutes its truth.

854
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,400
So the truth is this, or it.

855
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,440
And being for consciousness certainty

856
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,240
is just immediate apprehending.

857
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,160
Likewise, as a relation certainty

858
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,120
is an immediate pure relation.

859
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,920
Consciousness is I, nothing further,

860
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,840
a pure this and the singular individual

861
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,800
knows a pure this or he knows the singular.

862
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,680
So let's just take the first shape of consciousness

863
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:44,400
to be I know this.

864
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:50,080
Where knowledge here is just immediate.

865
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,480
So I'm not conceptualizing this.

866
00:45:55,480 --> 00:45:57,880
And so this is not an object of concepts.

867
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,720
It's not a thing with many properties.

868
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,360
All right, yes.

869
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,560
What is the root of immediate knowledge?

870
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,680
So immediate knowledge is knowledge

871
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,160
that isn't mediated by any other knowledge.

872
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:16,600
So the idea is to note, this is what sensuous certainty

873
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,840
thinks, to know this, I don't need to know anything else.

874
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,840
However, if what I knew about this was that it was a pencil,

875
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:29,760
I would need to know what a pencil is.

876
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:32,560
I would need to know the difference between pencil

877
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:35,560
and a pencil, that is to say the pencil

878
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:38,280
and the universal pencil, et cetera, et cetera.

879
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:40,120
But immediate knowledge is knowledge

880
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,840
not by means of anything else.

881
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:45,880
Wherever there's mediation, there's determinacy.

882
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,240
Being one thing and not being another.

883
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:52,040
So if there's no immediacy, there's no mediation,

884
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,520
there's no determinacy.

885
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:55,960
So I don't know this as opposed to something else.

886
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,080
I just know this.

887
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:00,800
So how do I know this if I see it for the first time?

888
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,920
That's what knowing is.

889
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,400
So you're assuming that to know this,

890
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,960
I need to know what it is.

891
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,600
I need to bring it under a concept.

892
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:11,720
Sensuous certainty is denying.

893
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,040
Sensuous certainty says, this is knowledge.

894
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:20,280
And so is this.

895
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:22,800
And so is this, yeah.

896
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,240
Isn't starting with immediate knowledge a kind of immediacy?

897
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,400
Because we're starting with immediacy

898
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,320
rather than mediacy.

899
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,200
Okay, great.

900
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:33,960
So that is gonna be the question.

901
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:35,880
So hold on to that question

902
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:38,480
until we get to the beginning of the science of logic.

903
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,920
Because I agree with you.

904
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,600
And I think that's the way we save

905
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:43,640
Pedagorean philosophy.

906
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:47,480
Yeah.

907
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,320
In the first like, I know or something,

908
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,720
it's like, it's as conceptualizing

909
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,880
and in the footnote is as conceptually comprehending.

910
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,960
Oh, yeah.

911
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,880
That's because Terry Pinkard loves to insert

912
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,880
his own interpretations into the translation.

913
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:06,520
Which is, so let me just, I'm actually not seeing,

914
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,440
where is the footnote actually?

915
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,600
It's on the first page and.

916
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,120
Yeah, but what sentence does it modify?

917
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:12,960
I have so many.

918
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,120
It's the last sentence of 90.

919
00:48:16,120 --> 00:48:16,960
The last sentence.

920
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:19,000
Oh, conceptualizing.

921
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,360
Yeah, so let's see what that is.

922
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:23,760
That's almost certainly gonna be Begrifen.

923
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:27,120
And Terry loves to translate Begrifen

924
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,520
as conceptually comprehending, which is hilarious.

925
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,760
Yeah, it's Begrifen.

926
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,600
Okay, Begrifen just means comprehending or conceptualizing.

927
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:38,440
It doesn't mean both.

928
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,560
That is to say, basic rule of translation.

929
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:43,240
Where there's one word, don't translate it as two words.

930
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,520
Okay, like that just doesn't work.

931
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:50,520
Okay, so what that should really be is comprehending.

932
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:55,080
Okay, now the reason he's translated

933
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,960
as conceptually comprehending,

934
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,720
this is in German, Begrifen,

935
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,400
is the word in German for concept is Begrif.

936
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:08,800
That's what a concept is.

937
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:12,600
Which is the noun form of the verb Begrifen,

938
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,320
which is also to grasp.

939
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:16,320
So Begrifen is also a grasping.

940
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,920
So in some ways, obviously it's a conceptualizing.

941
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,760
But in general, the closest thing in English to Begrifen

942
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:26,400
in philosophical texts is comprehending,

943
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,760
comprehending something.

944
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:29,280
So you should just translate it as comprehending.

945
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,120
Or you could translate it as conceptualizing,

946
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,440
but you do not wanna translate it

947
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,080
as conceptually comprehending.

948
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:37,880
That's just adding complexity that's not in the original.

949
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:40,520
Okay, so what Hegel is saying is

950
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:43,360
we must not conceptualize this thing.

951
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:49,360
Any, our job is to just ask what sensuous certainty says

952
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:56,600
about itself, not to bring our own concepts to bear

953
00:49:56,600 --> 00:49:59,600
on and make sensuous certainty

954
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:01,640
into something that we think it should be.

955
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,040
Okay, so now going further,

956
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,080
we're gonna skip 92, the end of 93.

957
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:14,080
The I, a knowing that knows the object only

958
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:18,560
for the reason that the object is,

959
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:22,280
but which itself can just as well be as not be.

960
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,280
So that means, so just to anticipate,

961
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,760
sensuous certainty is gonna undergo various changes

962
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:31,440
over the course of this chapter.

963
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,760
So Hegel begins by talking about

964
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:36,520
just the bare abstract idea,

965
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,920
or I'm sorry, just you start someone

966
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:39,280
by talking sensuous certainty,

967
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:42,640
and then imminently criticizes it.

968
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,600
And then sensuous, he allows sensuous certainty

969
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:49,520
to modify itself in light of those imminent criticisms

970
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,960
while remaining sensuous certainty.

971
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:54,680
So the first form of sensuous certainty

972
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,280
is one on which, in Hegelian terms,

973
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:00,520
the object, this, is the essence.

974
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:05,520
That means the object determines what it is to know it,

975
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,920
which means the object can be there

976
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:10,720
whether or not the subject is,

977
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,800
or the subject is purely receptive in knowing the object.

978
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:18,360
So the I, a knowing that knows the object

979
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,840
only for the reason that the object is,

980
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:23,960
but which itself can just as well be as not be.

981
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,960
So the knowing can be or not be, and the object still is.

982
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:32,400
However the object is, it is the true and the essence.

983
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,960
The object is indifferent as to whether it's known or not.

984
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,920
The object remains even when it is not known,

985
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,160
but if the object does not exist, then there is no known.

986
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:46,680
The object is therefore to be considered

987
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:50,240
in terms of whether, in sensuous certainty itself,

988
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,840
it is in fact the kind of essence

989
00:51:52,840 --> 00:51:56,320
which sensuous certainty passes it off as being.

990
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:59,600
That is to say, is immediate,

991
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:03,200
is immediate knowing a way of knowing this?

992
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,120
That's the question,

993
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:07,080
because that's what sensuous certainty says it is.

994
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,800
That is, it is to be considered as to whether this,

995
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:14,280
its concept, its conception of itself,

996
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,280
the object and the being of the object forehead,

997
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,800
which is to be the essence,

998
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:22,000
corresponds to the way it is present within that certainty.

999
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,920
To that end, we need not reflect on the object

1000
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:27,240
and mull over what it might be in truth.

1001
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:29,960
We need only to consider it as sensuous certainty

1002
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,200
has it in sensuous certainty itself.

1003
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,840
That is to say, we just have to do this imminently

1004
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:37,800
rather than transcendently, non-imminently,

1005
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,720
applying our own criteria to value.

1006
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,200
Therefore, sensuous certainty itself is to be asked,

1007
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,280
what is this?

1008
00:52:46,280 --> 00:52:49,480
If we take it in the twofold shape of its being

1009
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:51,640
as the now and the here,

1010
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,840
so one interesting thing about the phenomenology

1011
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:59,280
is Hegel assumes from page one

1012
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:01,640
that consciousness is consciousness

1013
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:03,040
of objects in space and time.

1014
00:53:04,840 --> 00:53:07,640
So whatever the project of the phenomenology is,

1015
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:11,040
he's not trying to answer the skeptic who's like,

1016
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,680
I didn't say anything about space and time.

1017
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,760
And as we'll see, he even assumes some very natural things

1018
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:19,640
about the structure of space and time,

1019
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,920
namely that it's divisible.

1020
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,400
So whatever the phenomenology is supposed to do,

1021
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:30,280
it's not supposed to refute the skeptic

1022
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:34,080
who denies that objects outside the mind

1023
00:53:34,080 --> 00:53:35,320
are in space and time,

1024
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:37,960
nor is it supposed to derive space and time

1025
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,040
from something more fundamental,

1026
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:43,280
which weirdly is part of the project of the Hegel system.

1027
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:46,000
Notoriously.

1028
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,800
So what I know can be characterized just purely imminently.

1029
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,760
We're just unfolding what's sent to a certainty.

1030
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,400
What I know is this here now,

1031
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,840
if we take it in the twofold shape of its being

1032
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:00,280
as the now and here,

1033
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,200
then the dialectic,

1034
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:04,000
where the, remember the dialectic

1035
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,640
is the internal imminent dialectic

1036
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,320
of a Hegel consciousness,

1037
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:11,560
where it generates contradictions of itself

1038
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:13,680
and tries to resolve them.

1039
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:16,360
The dialectic, which it has in itself,

1040
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:20,200
will take on a form as intelligible as the this itself.

1041
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,640
To the question, what is the now?

1042
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,120
We answer, for example, the now is the night.

1043
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,400
So if we ask sensuous conscious,

1044
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,200
so this is a slightly artificial example

1045
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,360
that Hegel uses to make a point.

1046
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:33,760
So I'll just read it and then I'll explain

1047
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,080
what the point is.

1048
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,820
We answer, for example, the now is night.

1049
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:40,080
In order to put the truth of this sensuous certainty

1050
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,800
to the test, a simple experiment will suffice.

1051
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:44,480
We write down this truth.

1052
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,480
A truth cannot be lost by being written down anymore

1053
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,800
than it can be lost by our preserving it.

1054
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:53,600
And if now, this midday, we look at this truth,

1055
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,200
which has been written down,

1056
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,120
we will have to say that it has become rather staged.

1057
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:01,560
Okay, so the idea is the sentence,

1058
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,320
now is night.

1059
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:24,800
Is true, say, at 11 p.m. and is false at 2 p.m.

1060
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:41,600
So what Hegel is doing is arguing that

1061
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:46,600
in so far as sensuous certainty

1062
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,900
says that knowledge is I know this here now,

1063
00:55:55,680 --> 00:56:00,280
it cannot make sense of now.

1064
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:02,680
Why?

1065
00:56:02,680 --> 00:56:06,860
Because Hegel argues in the next paragraph

1066
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:10,240
that now is a universal.

1067
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:15,240
That is to say, it applies to multiple different times.

1068
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:21,000
It applies to every time at the time at which it's uttered.

1069
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:24,160
So for any time, now uttered at that time

1070
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:25,300
refers to that time.

1071
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:31,200
Now refers to noon, 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.

1072
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:38,160
Okay, now why would it be bad

1073
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,660
if the object of knowledge for sensuous certainty

1074
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:42,780
were a universal?

1075
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:48,680
It would be bad because a universal is a one over a minute.

1076
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:53,000
It applies to multiple particulars.

1077
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:59,520
But that means it is distinct from the particulars

1078
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:03,500
it applies to, and they are distinct from one another,

1079
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:09,500
which means that to know a universal requires determinancy.

1080
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,980
This is determinately this rather than that,

1081
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,220
and determinately a particular rather than a universal,

1082
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:20,580
and a universal is a determinately a universal

1083
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,460
rather than a particular.

1084
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,820
That means knowledge of a universal requires mediation.

1085
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,700
You know what a universal is

1086
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,740
by means of knowing it isn't a particular,

1087
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,980
namely the things that it can instantiate.

1088
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,580
But there can't be anything immediate

1089
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:40,000
in the object of sensuous certainty,

1090
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,840
so this cannot characterize its object.

1091
00:57:44,780 --> 00:57:46,780
Now in contemporary philosophy,

1092
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:50,180
it's very weird to think of now as a universal.

1093
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:53,900
If you said that in contemporary philosophy of language,

1094
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,660
class, Imogen Dickey would kill you.

1095
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:00,140
So the more natural thing is to think of it now

1096
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:01,940
as what we call an indexical.

1097
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:07,460
Which is to say, something that refers to different things

1098
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:10,740
under different contexts of utterances, contexts of utterance.

1099
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:15,740
So now, as uttered at time t,

1100
00:58:21,020 --> 00:58:24,840
refers to time t.

1101
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:28,300
So that's the more contemporary way

1102
00:58:28,300 --> 00:58:30,980
of expressing the nature of now.

1103
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,500
That it's an indexical rather than a universal.

1104
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:35,940
But Hegel's point remains,

1105
00:58:35,940 --> 00:58:39,660
because this also requires the difference

1106
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,420
between individual times

1107
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:46,220
and a general quantifier over times.

1108
00:58:46,220 --> 00:58:48,720
This says for all times,

1109
00:58:51,340 --> 00:58:54,680
so in order for sensuous certainty

1110
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,540
to have an indexical expression

1111
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,540
in the objects of its knowledge,

1112
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:03,020
it would have to understand indexicals.

1113
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:07,840
Which involves understanding that one expression

1114
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:10,740
can refer to different things at different times.

1115
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:15,240
That requires determinacy, requires mediation.

1116
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:21,100
So the same argument eliminates the indexical now

1117
00:59:22,180 --> 00:59:24,260
from being within the content

1118
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,260
of sensuous certainty's knowledge.

1119
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:31,260
The same arises for Hugh,

1120
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:34,100
as Hegel goes on to say.

1121
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:40,620
We also express the sensuous, this is 98.

1122
00:59:40,620 --> 00:59:44,140
The same case comes up in the other form of the this,

1123
00:59:44,140 --> 00:59:45,900
namely in the here.

1124
00:59:45,900 --> 00:59:48,460
For example, here is the tree.

1125
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,780
I turn around this truth vanishes,

1126
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:53,500
and it has inverted itself into its contrary.

1127
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,600
Here there is not a tree, but rather a house.

1128
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:58,780
The here itself does not disappear,

1129
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:01,460
rather it endures in the disappearance of the house,

1130
01:00:01,460 --> 01:00:04,460
the tree, and it is indifferent to being a house, a tree.

1131
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:07,900
But this shows itself again to be a mediated simplicity

1132
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,180
or as being universality.

1133
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,760
So once again, Hegel thinks of here as a universal.

1134
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:15,420
That's slightly odd in a contemporary perspective

1135
01:00:15,420 --> 01:00:17,120
to think that here is a universal

1136
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:20,220
that's instantiated by every location.

1137
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,540
It's more natural to think of it

1138
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:26,540
as a indexical for all locations L.

1139
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:35,420
As utter at L refers to L.

1140
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:45,500
If you want me to write out the clause for this.

1141
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:46,700
So the problem with this, right,

1142
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:48,600
is it depends on where you're pointing.

1143
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,900
And a disgraced former colleague of mine,

1144
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,740
Colin McGinn, has this famous paper

1145
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:54,540
where he tries to settle the question

1146
01:00:54,540 --> 01:00:57,700
exactly which object is referred to by pointing.

1147
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:01,500
And so he literally has in this paper a diagram of a hand.

1148
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:03,900
And then there's this question of like,

1149
01:01:03,900 --> 01:01:06,340
well, it's obviously, it doesn't have to be exactly.

1150
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:09,900
So like, you know, there's like a cone of reference

1151
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,720
and there's like an empirical question,

1152
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:13,700
what is the angle theta?

1153
01:01:13,700 --> 01:01:17,720
Like if I say, can I say this

1154
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,100
and be referring to the lectern?

1155
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:20,580
No, it's too far away.

1156
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,040
There, can I be referring to the lectern?

1157
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:25,020
Questionable, definitely.

1158
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:27,620
So somewhere there's this vague boundary

1159
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,240
of the theta of reference.

1160
01:01:30,240 --> 01:01:31,580
This is what, okay, this is what people

1161
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:33,380
like Colin McGinn spend their time doing.

1162
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:36,540
Okay.

1163
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:39,980
The fact that it was a hand is deeply ironic.

1164
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:41,340
Okay.

1165
01:01:41,340 --> 01:01:46,340
So even if we think of here as an indexical

1166
01:01:50,740 --> 01:01:52,820
expression rather than a universal,

1167
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:54,780
the same point applies.

1168
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:59,240
Because this requires there being a distinction

1169
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:02,900
between the general term location

1170
01:02:02,900 --> 01:02:04,780
and the individual locations.

1171
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:06,820
That is to say, since you're certain

1172
01:02:06,820 --> 01:02:10,020
you would have to understand differences among locations

1173
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:15,020
and the difference between a location

1174
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:17,500
and the general term location.

1175
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:21,860
That requires, that is determinate

1176
01:02:21,860 --> 01:02:23,220
and that means it's median.

1177
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:27,580
You understand one thing via an object.

1178
01:02:27,580 --> 01:02:28,500
And it can't do that.

1179
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:32,340
So it also can't have here in the content of what it knows.

1180
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:34,260
Yes.

1181
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:35,300
Doesn't the,

1182
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,780
Colin, thinking of knowledge as a knowledgeable object

1183
01:02:39,780 --> 01:02:44,040
already presumed like a distinction between objects

1184
01:02:44,040 --> 01:02:46,260
rather than just being an object,

1185
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:48,740
which to say now is night I feel

1186
01:02:48,740 --> 01:02:51,380
it's already kind of giving some certainty,

1187
01:02:51,380 --> 01:02:54,380
something that's uncertainty has already denounced.

1188
01:02:54,380 --> 01:02:56,660
Now is not, it just is, isn't it?

1189
01:02:56,660 --> 01:02:57,620
Exactly.

1190
01:02:57,620 --> 01:03:01,360
And that means that either,

1191
01:03:02,580 --> 01:03:07,420
so what you're really showing is

1192
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:11,860
sense certainty shouldn't even be talking

1193
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:12,820
about here and now.

1194
01:03:13,660 --> 01:03:15,500
It should just say, I know this.

1195
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:17,980
Or if it wants to say here and now,

1196
01:03:19,780 --> 01:03:24,780
it should just refuse to look at any other objects

1197
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:25,860
or at any other time.

1198
01:03:26,980 --> 01:03:28,520
That is to say, it should say,

1199
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,580
what I know is this here now,

1200
01:03:30,580 --> 01:03:34,020
don't tell me about any other objects or at any other times.

1201
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:37,220
I'm saying it shouldn't even recognize other objects.

1202
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,960
It just exists.

1203
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:39,800
Exactly.

1204
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:43,000
So Hegel's going to modify sensuous certainty

1205
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,160
to answer his own objection in the direction

1206
01:03:46,160 --> 01:03:47,200
that you're indicating.

1207
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:48,040
Okay.

1208
01:03:48,040 --> 01:03:48,880
Yeah.

1209
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:53,880
So this situation of I determines universal of no.

1210
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:02,240
So now in time, so now as P1 or P2 or P3

1211
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,840
is dependent on my situation.

1212
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,960
Yeah, so Hegel's going to do exactly the same move

1213
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,560
with I in one second.

1214
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:12,760
Because I is also an index.

1215
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,160
That is to say, in his terms, it's a universal.

1216
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:18,240
We would think of it more naturally as an index.

1217
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:20,400
But before we got there,

1218
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,920
Hegel said something really important in 97.

1219
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:28,460
We also express the sensuous as a universal,

1220
01:04:28,460 --> 01:04:30,500
but we say is this,

1221
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,680
i.e. the universal this,

1222
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:35,360
or we say it is, i.e. being as such.

1223
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:37,320
Let's leave the being theme aside.

1224
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:40,200
We thereby, of course, do not represent to ourselves

1225
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:43,480
the universal, this for being as such,

1226
01:04:43,480 --> 01:04:45,720
but we express the universal.

1227
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:47,760
Or in this sensuous certainty,

1228
01:04:47,760 --> 01:04:50,840
we do not at all say what we mean.

1229
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:53,520
So there's a distinction,

1230
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:55,880
this is totally central to sensuous certainty

1231
01:04:55,880 --> 01:05:00,880
between what we say and what we mean,

1232
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,040
by which Hegel means what we intend to say.

1233
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:10,840
So he's going to argue that what sensuous certainty

1234
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:15,520
intends to mean is this particular piece of chalk.

1235
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:19,640
But what it actually says is the universal this.

1236
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:24,040
So it can't say what it means to say.

1237
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,800
So what sensuous certainty is trying to do is express

1238
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:32,520
that what it knows is particulars.

1239
01:05:33,520 --> 01:05:37,680
But with only this here and now, it can't do that.

1240
01:05:37,680 --> 01:05:40,360
Because Hegel will argue over the course of the chapter,

1241
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,040
to know a particular, you have to have both

1242
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,200
something like this here and now,

1243
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:50,800
call it an indexical, call it an intuition,

1244
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,920
and a conception of a universal.

1245
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:58,000
You have to distinguish this from other particulars

1246
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:59,400
in terms of its properties.

1247
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:04,880
So sensuous certainty thinks of itself

1248
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,760
that it knows individual particulars.

1249
01:06:07,760 --> 01:06:11,000
But what it says is, I know this,

1250
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,480
and this is a universal.

1251
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:17,480
Because that's this, that's this, that's this.

1252
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,080
Everything's at this.

1253
01:06:19,080 --> 01:06:22,080
So if what it knows is this, it knows,

1254
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:25,960
rather than this.

1255
01:06:26,960 --> 01:06:27,800
Yeah.

1256
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:30,320
I'm confused because I thought we are not,

1257
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:33,000
we're trying to not conceptualize in answering

1258
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:36,560
for the sensuous certainty person.

1259
01:06:36,560 --> 01:06:40,640
But then we introduce the concept of a universal.

1260
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:44,720
Wouldn't they just not conceptualize that?

1261
01:06:44,720 --> 01:06:45,560
Right.

1262
01:06:48,560 --> 01:06:52,720
So one background worry here is whether Hegel is

1263
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:57,440
making sensuous certainty answer questions

1264
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,160
that according to sensuous certainty's own concept

1265
01:07:00,160 --> 01:07:02,120
of itself, it doesn't have to.

1266
01:07:02,120 --> 01:07:02,960
Yeah.

1267
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:03,800
Okay.

1268
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:10,680
It's important to note that sensuous certainty

1269
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,080
is not just mute.

1270
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:18,080
It's not like, this is not caveman consciousness.

1271
01:07:18,360 --> 01:07:22,200
So it has a conception of itself of what it knows.

1272
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,200
Now, it can conceptualize its knowledge

1273
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:28,280
without thinking that what it knows

1274
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:29,640
is a conceptualized object.

1275
01:07:30,560 --> 01:07:33,640
So in order, the whole setup is that we're examining

1276
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:35,400
concepts of knowledge.

1277
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:38,200
So sensuous certainty has to have a concept of itself.

1278
01:07:39,720 --> 01:07:43,760
But what it knows is the object,

1279
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,480
and it knows it non-conceptually.

1280
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:49,200
Which means the project of the phenomenology

1281
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:54,200
is not to take each conception of knowledge and then ask,

1282
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:58,320
does that, or each shape of consciousness

1283
01:07:58,320 --> 01:07:59,640
that has a conception of knowledge,

1284
01:07:59,640 --> 01:08:01,440
ask does that shape of consciousness

1285
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,120
know its conception of knowledge?

1286
01:08:04,120 --> 01:08:06,480
That is to say, we don't take the concept of knowledge

1287
01:08:06,480 --> 01:08:08,040
and put it on the object side.

1288
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,360
Because sensuous certainty would immediately fail that.

1289
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:14,320
Because a concept of knowledge is conceptual.

1290
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:16,320
So sensuous certainty doesn't think it knows

1291
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:17,720
its concept of knowledge.

1292
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:20,040
That's just what it says if you ask it.

1293
01:08:20,040 --> 01:08:21,680
What I know is this.

1294
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:23,280
But your concept of knowledge is not a this,

1295
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,760
yeah, yeah, yeah, epistemology is kind of bullshit.

1296
01:08:26,760 --> 01:08:28,320
It's not something that it knows.

1297
01:08:28,320 --> 01:08:29,640
It's just how it answers.

1298
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,280
It's how it conceives of this.

1299
01:08:31,280 --> 01:08:33,080
And so it would be cheating, it would be cheap

1300
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,080
if we were like, well, you don't know that.

1301
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,000
It's supposed to be not cheating if what we say is,

1302
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,200
that immediate knowledge isn't knowledge of that object.

1303
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:43,360
It's not the object that you intend to know,

1304
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,640
the object that you mean.

1305
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,080
The object that you say is something different.

1306
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:47,920
Yeah?

1307
01:08:47,920 --> 01:08:51,120
Well, why not start with the caveman consciousness?

1308
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,800
Well, because it's really hard to argue with caveman, right?

1309
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,960
The epistemological version of,

1310
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,600
oh, I'm just a caveman lawyer, right?

1311
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:01,520
I, that was just a gesture and a joke.

1312
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:04,400
I didn't really know what I needed to tell you that through.

1313
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:09,400
Yeah, because caveman consciousness

1314
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:12,840
sort of,

1315
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:20,040
by definition, doesn't have the conception of itself as knowledge.

1316
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:26,280
Okay, and that might mean, so background question,

1317
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:31,400
is Hegel assuming something to the effect that if you know,

1318
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:33,320
maybe you don't know you know,

1319
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,760
but you can coherently conceptualize your knowledge

1320
01:09:36,760 --> 01:09:40,560
in a way that survives imminent dialectical critique?

1321
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:43,200
I think he is, potentially.

1322
01:09:43,200 --> 01:09:48,200
Okay, so we've talked about 97 and 98, time check.

1323
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:54,200
Let's take a 10 minute break.

1324
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:09,240
Consciousness, Hegel has raised these problems

1325
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:10,400
for sensuous certainty.

1326
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,280
Here and now are universals.

1327
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:21,400
Therefore, either what sensuous certainty knows

1328
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:23,280
is the universal this,

1329
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:25,120
which applies to absolutely everything.

1330
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,560
Or, insofar as it wants to know this,

1331
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,240
it can't use here or now to figure it out.

1332
01:10:35,240 --> 01:10:39,600
Okay, now sensuous certainty modifies itself.

1333
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:42,880
And it modifies itself in the direction

1334
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:44,640
of making itself the essence.

1335
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:48,560
Now what that means is, it says,

1336
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:53,000
okay, I determine what this is,

1337
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:56,520
because what is here or what is now,

1338
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,280
or what is this, is what is,

1339
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:04,200
it is where I am, and when I am, and what I'm pointing to.

1340
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:09,120
So it tries to solve this problem of this here now

1341
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,880
by anchoring the reference of this here and now to the I.

1342
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:16,200
So I could write those out, those indexical expressions,

1343
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:19,280
indexical clauses, using I, but I won't bother,

1344
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,760
because we can all see what the problem is gonna be.

1345
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:26,760
The problem is going to be that I itself is an indexical.

1346
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:32,600
I, as uttered by any subject S, refers to S.

1347
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:37,000
So Hegel will say I is a universal.

1348
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:41,840
I refers indifferently to every subject that can say I.

1349
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:46,760
Or, if we take the more contemporary conception

1350
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,320
on which it's an indexical,

1351
01:11:49,360 --> 01:11:54,360
that cannot be within the content of what consciousness knows.

1352
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:58,480
Consciousness is explanation of how it knows its object

1353
01:11:58,480 --> 01:11:59,760
cannot go by universals.

1354
01:12:01,360 --> 01:12:06,040
So now Hegel says that this is the bottom of 102,

1355
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:09,800
oh he's saying 101, this just expresses this idea

1356
01:12:09,800 --> 01:12:12,480
of tying, of using the I to anchor

1357
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:14,880
the reference of here and now.

1358
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,960
Now is daytime, because I see it.

1359
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,320
Here is a tree for precisely the same reason,

1360
01:12:19,320 --> 01:12:21,080
however sensuous certainty experiences

1361
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,520
in these relationships, the same dialectic

1362
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:25,760
as it did within the preceding relationships.

1363
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:29,240
I, this, see the tree and assert the tree to be tree,

1364
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:30,800
to be here.

1365
01:12:30,800 --> 01:12:32,760
Now, properly speaking, it doesn't assert anything

1366
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:34,400
to be here, that's 8%.

1367
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,240
However, another I sees the house

1368
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:39,360
and asserts that there is no tree here, but rather a house.

1369
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:41,480
Both truths have the same warrants,

1370
01:12:41,480 --> 01:12:43,840
namely the immediacy of seeing and the surety

1371
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:46,320
and the seerons, which both have about their knowing,

1372
01:12:46,320 --> 01:12:48,840
however one vanishes into the other.

1373
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:52,400
So I see a house, Christa sees a tree,

1374
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,520
I see a house, I see a tree.

1375
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,080
They can't both be right.

1376
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:04,320
And sensuous certainty, or let's see, I see a tree,

1377
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:07,960
I see a non-tree, or I don't see a tree.

1378
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,320
They can't both be right,

1379
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:13,000
and sensuous certainty doesn't have the means

1380
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:15,680
to distinguish the two in the way we would by saying,

1381
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:18,760
when I say I see a tree, it means Nick Stang sees a tree.

1382
01:13:18,760 --> 01:13:21,000
And when Christa says I see a non-tree,

1383
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:22,560
it means Christa sees a tree,

1384
01:13:22,560 --> 01:13:24,800
because that would involve having the distinction

1385
01:13:24,800 --> 01:13:28,240
between the universal, one who can say I,

1386
01:13:28,240 --> 01:13:30,640
and particular people who can say I.

1387
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:33,480
Okay, 102, the beginning of 102,

1388
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,880
I've already explained what's going on.

1389
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,760
So then at the very bottom of page 63,

1390
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,120
however much this demand is set before science

1391
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,880
as its touchstone,

1392
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:45,160
a demand which it would surely not last out,

1393
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,880
namely the deduce, construct, find a priori,

1394
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,960
however one wishes to express it,

1395
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:52,760
a so-called this thing, or this person,

1396
01:13:52,760 --> 01:13:55,520
still it is reasonable that the demand should state

1397
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:58,000
which of the many things this thing,

1398
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:00,680
or which of the eyes this I means,

1399
01:14:00,680 --> 01:14:02,840
but it is impossible to state this.

1400
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:05,840
So sensuous certainty says,

1401
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,920
what it knows is this here now,

1402
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:10,680
but it cannot, compatible with its own shape or consciousness,

1403
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:12,960
say which thing it knows.

1404
01:14:14,520 --> 01:14:16,680
And so either it knows the universal,

1405
01:14:16,680 --> 01:14:19,160
which is what it says, but it doesn't want to say that,

1406
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,720
it doesn't mean to say that,

1407
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,880
or it needs to be modified.

1408
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:27,520
Okay, 103, sensuous certainty therefore learns

1409
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:30,640
from experience in the technical Hegelian sense

1410
01:14:30,640 --> 01:14:34,080
that its essence is neither in the object nor in the eye,

1411
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,720
and in the immediacy is in immediacy

1412
01:14:36,720 --> 01:14:39,600
of neither one or the other of them.

1413
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,000
For in both, what I mean is instead what is inessential,

1414
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:44,760
and the object and eye are universals

1415
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,280
in which the now and the human eye

1416
01:14:46,280 --> 01:14:48,680
that me and do not endure are not.

1417
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:51,360
So it's tried making the object be essential,

1418
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:53,280
a thing that determines what knowing is,

1419
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:57,480
it's tried making itself the essential

1420
01:14:57,480 --> 01:15:00,400
by using it to anchor the reference of here and now,

1421
01:15:00,760 --> 01:15:02,120
neither worked.

1422
01:15:02,120 --> 01:15:05,200
We thereby come to posit the whole of sensuous certainty

1423
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:07,320
itself as its essence,

1424
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,920
and no longer only as a moment of sensuous certainty

1425
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,600
as happened in both cases,

1426
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,200
in which at first the object approaches the eye,

1427
01:15:13,200 --> 01:15:14,680
and the eye itself reaches supposed to be

1428
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:16,320
the reality of sensuous certainty.

1429
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:19,080
It is thus only the whole of sensuous certainty itself,

1430
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:21,240
which links tenaciously in such sensuous certainty

1431
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:23,800
to immediacy, in which thereby excludes from itself

1432
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:26,240
all the opposition that took place in what proceeding.

1433
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:27,400
So sensuous certainty realizes,

1434
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:30,120
okay, I tried making the object the essence,

1435
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,000
I tried making myself the essence, neither worked.

1436
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,640
So you need to think of it,

1437
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:34,960
they're both essential or neither.

1438
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:38,320
I'm not gonna talk about essence anymore.

1439
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:41,320
So I'm just gonna take sensuous certainty itself.

1440
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:44,840
This situation of I know this,

1441
01:15:44,840 --> 01:15:46,560
that's gonna be the whole thing.

1442
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,200
This pure immediacy therefore no longer has any concern

1443
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:51,520
with the otherness of the here as a tree,

1444
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,360
which is a here that is a non-tree,

1445
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:55,640
nor with the otherness of now as daytime,

1446
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:57,840
and which passes over into a now that is night,

1447
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:58,800
nor with another eye,

1448
01:15:58,800 --> 01:16:00,720
for which something other is the object.

1449
01:16:00,720 --> 01:16:03,240
So this new shape of self-consciousness,

1450
01:16:03,240 --> 01:16:06,080
new shape of self-censored certainty claims,

1451
01:16:06,080 --> 01:16:09,600
look, I know this, and if you raise any objections

1452
01:16:09,600 --> 01:16:12,760
about trees or houses, things I don't know now,

1453
01:16:12,760 --> 01:16:15,280
that isn't this, I'm going to ignore you.

1454
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:18,800
Or you could think of this as episodic sensuous certainty.

1455
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:23,200
This sensuous certainty knows this, now it knows this.

1456
01:16:23,200 --> 01:16:27,720
And if you ask it, but now is the water bottle,

1457
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,000
now is the pencil is no longer true,

1458
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,760
what are you talking about?

1459
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:34,560
So now it's immunized itself

1460
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:36,560
against all of these Hegelian objections.

1461
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:39,760
So really these earlier Hegelian objections

1462
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:44,320
were just moves to get you to see the logic of the game.

1463
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,560
Because this is where sensuous certainty

1464
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,120
should have started from.

1465
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:52,120
Because all of these problems that were brought in

1466
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:53,880
were really properly speaking things

1467
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:56,000
that sensuous certainty never claimed to them.

1468
01:16:56,000 --> 01:16:58,640
Objects that weren't sensuously present to them,

1469
01:16:58,640 --> 01:17:02,080
like the tree when it was only perceiving the house,

1470
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,720
weren't only sensing the house.

1471
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,880
Like the daytime when now is night.

1472
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,440
And other eyes.

1473
01:17:08,440 --> 01:17:10,760
So now sensuous certainty doesn't want to hear anything

1474
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:12,560
about a house when it's looking at a tree.

1475
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:14,400
It doesn't want to hear anything about daytime

1476
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,240
when it's night.

1477
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:16,800
And it doesn't want to hear anything about eyes.

1478
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:18,840
And if you raise that, it's going to tell you,

1479
01:17:18,840 --> 01:17:20,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

1480
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:22,240
None of that's knowledge, that's all bullshit.

1481
01:17:22,240 --> 01:17:23,780
Don't.

1482
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:24,900
I just have one question.

1483
01:17:24,900 --> 01:17:27,460
Is it maybe even when we're talking about something

1484
01:17:27,460 --> 01:17:30,060
like this thing, you could call it an object?

1485
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:35,820
Or is it more just like a bundle of sense data or something?

1486
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:38,660
Bundle of sense data already brings in too much.

1487
01:17:38,660 --> 01:17:43,220
And object is a super, super general notion.

1488
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:46,180
It's literally just the accusative.

1489
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:51,580
That is to say, it's what consciousness is of.

1490
01:17:51,580 --> 01:17:53,460
Whenever there's of-ness, there's an object.

1491
01:17:54,420 --> 01:17:57,180
However much you use the word object, but OK.

1492
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:00,420
So at this stage, we're at the real caveman consciousness?

1493
01:18:00,420 --> 01:18:03,460
Except that, unlike the caveman,

1494
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:06,660
it has a conception of its known.

1495
01:18:06,660 --> 01:18:08,040
Otherwise, the whole project wouldn't go on.

1496
01:18:08,040 --> 01:18:09,240
You cannot argue with cavemen.

1497
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:11,580
I mean, probably you could argue with cavemen.

1498
01:18:11,580 --> 01:18:14,140
There's a great book about how it's called

1499
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:17,060
The Dawn of Everything by Ray Rundland Groud.

1500
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,620
And the basic idea is we all think

1501
01:18:18,620 --> 01:18:23,420
of a prehistoric, so-called hunter-gatherer,

1502
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:28,660
societies as really boring and life-having soft.

1503
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:32,100
But actually, it was probably way better.

1504
01:18:32,100 --> 01:18:35,100
It's just talking about consciousness

1505
01:18:35,100 --> 01:18:38,380
or the sense of certain telling us something.

1506
01:18:38,380 --> 01:18:41,020
I just wonder, because in this book,

1507
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:44,580
there's a concept called cognitive impenetrability.

1508
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:48,420
It says that in perception, it just perception itself.

1509
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:49,980
It doesn't tell us anything.

1510
01:18:49,980 --> 01:18:54,780
But some people also argue that we can actually

1511
01:18:54,780 --> 01:18:58,260
perceive some high-order property in things,

1512
01:18:58,260 --> 01:19:01,300
for example, like unity, identity, and so on.

1513
01:19:01,300 --> 01:19:04,940
Yeah, so this conception, this model of consciousness

1514
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:08,820
is several levels more primitive than anything

1515
01:19:08,820 --> 01:19:11,060
you would find in contemporary analytic philosophy

1516
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,620
or cognitive science.

1517
01:19:12,620 --> 01:19:14,940
Because this has not been developed

1518
01:19:14,940 --> 01:19:17,660
because it's plausible as an account of consciousness

1519
01:19:17,900 --> 01:19:19,780
or because it's something that emerges naturally

1520
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:21,300
from the sciences.

1521
01:19:21,300 --> 01:19:26,300
It's been introduced purely to get the project started.

1522
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:36,580
This is way more primitive than any conception

1523
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:39,340
of perceptual consciousness that you will find

1524
01:19:39,340 --> 01:19:41,380
in contemporary literature.

1525
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:42,660
Let's just read a little bit further.

1526
01:19:42,660 --> 01:19:45,460
This pure immediacy, therefore, no longer has any concern

1527
01:19:45,460 --> 01:19:47,460
with the otherness of the here as a tree,

1528
01:19:47,580 --> 01:19:48,780
which is a here that is a non-tree,

1529
01:19:48,780 --> 01:19:50,260
nor the otherness of now is daytime,

1530
01:19:50,260 --> 01:19:52,060
which passes over into a now that is night,

1531
01:19:52,060 --> 01:19:54,860
nor with another eye, for which something other is the object.

1532
01:19:54,860 --> 01:19:58,180
Its truth is preserved as a self-consistent relation,

1533
01:19:58,180 --> 01:20:00,100
which makes no difference of essentiality

1534
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:03,140
and non-essentiality between the eye and the object,

1535
01:20:03,140 --> 01:20:05,020
and into which, therefore, no difference at all

1536
01:20:05,020 --> 01:20:06,260
can force its entry.

1537
01:20:06,260 --> 01:20:09,480
I, this eye, assert therefore that here is a tree.

1538
01:20:09,480 --> 01:20:12,660
Once again, shouldn't say is a tree, just here.

1539
01:20:12,660 --> 01:20:13,500
Happens to be a tree.

1540
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:14,980
And it's not the case that I turn around

1541
01:20:14,980 --> 01:20:17,020
so that the here would become for me not a tree,

1542
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,500
or that I myself, at another time,

1543
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:19,980
take the here not to be a tree,

1544
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,480
the now not to be the daytime.

1545
01:20:21,480 --> 01:20:23,380
Rather, I am pure intuitive,

1546
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:26,220
and I stick with, namely, that now is daytime,

1547
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:28,580
or else I also stick with here is a tree.

1548
01:20:28,580 --> 01:20:30,880
I also do not compare the here and the now themselves

1549
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:31,720
with each other.

1550
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:34,220
Rather, I cling tenaciously to an immediate relation.

1551
01:20:34,220 --> 01:20:35,380
Now it is daytime.

1552
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:39,480
So any of these previous or past experiences,

1553
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:41,280
any other objects in the environment,

1554
01:20:41,280 --> 01:20:44,300
any other subjects are now just being completely left out

1555
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:48,060
by sensuous certainty as objects of knowledge.

1556
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:51,480
Since the certainty itself no longer wishes to step forward

1557
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:53,340
when we draw its attention to a now that is night,

1558
01:20:53,340 --> 01:20:54,720
or to an eye for which it is night,

1559
01:20:54,720 --> 01:20:56,940
we step up to it and let ourselves point

1560
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:58,380
to the now that is a certainty.

1561
01:20:58,380 --> 01:21:00,300
So this angles, the metaphor is supposed to be,

1562
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:03,340
we now take up the standpoint of sensuous certainty.

1563
01:21:03,340 --> 01:21:06,300
We look out from the eyes of sensuous certainty.

1564
01:21:07,500 --> 01:21:10,060
Thus we must enter into the same point of time or space,

1565
01:21:10,060 --> 01:21:11,260
point it out to ourselves,

1566
01:21:11,260 --> 01:21:13,540
allow ourselves to be made into the same eye

1567
01:21:13,700 --> 01:21:15,340
as that is a knowing uncertainty.

1568
01:21:15,340 --> 01:21:17,960
Let us see therefore how what is immediate,

1569
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:20,900
which is pointed out to us is composed.

1570
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:23,700
Okay, so now Hegel first makes the point

1571
01:21:23,700 --> 01:21:27,780
that he's going to make in 106 and 107 about time.

1572
01:21:27,780 --> 01:21:28,820
And because it's about time,

1573
01:21:28,820 --> 01:21:30,760
it's a little bit more complicated.

1574
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:32,300
But I'll just say it about time,

1575
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,660
you'll get the basic structure of it,

1576
01:21:33,660 --> 01:21:35,900
and then we'll talk about space.

1577
01:21:35,900 --> 01:21:38,980
So he first makes it about now, then he makes it about here.

1578
01:21:38,980 --> 01:21:41,880
So the point about now is that I say,

1579
01:21:41,880 --> 01:21:45,140
what I know is this here now,

1580
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:49,480
saying that takes a certain amount of time.

1581
01:21:50,560 --> 01:21:53,440
And I haven't said it until I've said all of it.

1582
01:21:54,920 --> 01:21:57,420
But by the time I've said it,

1583
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,020
what I intended to say,

1584
01:22:00,260 --> 01:22:03,440
the object that I intended to say that I know

1585
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:06,240
the beginning of that no longer is.

1586
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:10,840
Because if it did, if the object persisted,

1587
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:13,080
it would be a universal.

1588
01:22:13,080 --> 01:22:15,520
It would be a thing that's one over many.

1589
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:18,160
Not a property, but a thing that can exist

1590
01:22:18,160 --> 01:22:19,800
at different times.

1591
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,520
And so for consciousness,

1592
01:22:22,520 --> 01:22:25,960
to be able to give an account of why this here now

1593
01:22:26,960 --> 01:22:30,520
refers either to the first moment of the thing,

1594
01:22:30,520 --> 01:22:32,600
or the whole life of the thing,

1595
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,280
it would be able to have to distinguish

1596
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:36,760
the thing as a universal,

1597
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,520
or a thing that endures through time

1598
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,520
from its various moments of time.

1599
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,000
And that requires mediation.

1600
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,880
That requires a distinction among things.

1601
01:22:46,880 --> 01:22:50,160
And that is not something that such a certain can know.

1602
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,060
So the idea is,

1603
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:55,720
time is not,

1604
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:58,960
there's more than one moment of time.

1605
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:03,760
So Hegel's just assuming there's more than one moment of time.

1606
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,280
Thinking the thought, what I know is this here now,

1607
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,640
or what I know is this now, takes some time.

1608
01:23:12,020 --> 01:23:15,120
You haven't finished it until all that time has passed.

1609
01:23:16,420 --> 01:23:21,420
But the object, the moment of time that began,

1610
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:24,680
no longer is, so either you're no longer able

1611
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,880
to refer to that moment of time,

1612
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,160
or you're referring to a thing that persists through time,

1613
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,720
and that requires mediation.

1614
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,520
That requires the idea of a thing

1615
01:23:34,520 --> 01:23:36,560
that exists at different times.

1616
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,800
Is Hegel also assuming time is infinitely divisible?

1617
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,600
I don't think he's assuming it's infinitely divisible.

1618
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,280
I think he's assuming it's divisible.

1619
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:51,200
But he might be assuming it's infinitely divisible.

1620
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:54,100
The most he's assuming is that it's orbital.

1621
01:23:54,100 --> 01:23:55,400
He's infinitely divisible.

1622
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:57,040
He's not assuming it's infinitely divided.

1623
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:01,080
That is to say, there's always a smaller interval of time.

1624
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,320
So that's the time point.

1625
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:04,320
More complicated.

1626
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:06,440
The here point is much simpler.

1627
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:09,560
So 108.

1628
01:24:09,560 --> 01:24:11,040
The here that has been pointed out

1629
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:14,320
and to which I cling is likewise a this here,

1630
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:17,000
which is in fact not this here,

1631
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,280
but is rather an in front of and behind

1632
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,640
or an above and below or a right and left.

1633
01:24:22,560 --> 01:24:26,880
So I refer to something that is spatially complex.

1634
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:28,460
That is to say, has parts.

1635
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:31,960
The here, which is supposed to be pointed out,

1636
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:35,520
vanishes into another here, but that one likewise vanishes.

1637
01:24:36,520 --> 01:24:41,520
That is to say, here could refer,

1638
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:46,280
if I say here, that could refer to the whole object

1639
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,040
or refer to any of its parts.

1640
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:52,440
What is pointed out, held onto and which endures

1641
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:56,160
is a negative this, which only is as the here's are taken

1642
01:24:56,160 --> 01:24:58,640
as they're supposed to be, but which in being so taken

1643
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,000
have sublated themselves.

1644
01:25:01,560 --> 01:25:03,400
It is a simple summary of many years.

1645
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,240
Why did you guys do this to yourself?

1646
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:09,160
You could have taken bioethics instead you're reading this.

1647
01:25:09,160 --> 01:25:12,800
Okay, so what he means by that is

1648
01:25:15,720 --> 01:25:18,880
so he's assuming that physical objects

1649
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:23,380
are spatially extended, so they have parts.

1650
01:25:23,380 --> 01:25:25,280
The thing that sensuous surgery knows

1651
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:27,720
is a spatially complex object with parts.

1652
01:25:29,960 --> 01:25:33,500
And that means that it's spatially universal.

1653
01:25:33,540 --> 01:25:36,180
That is to say, it's in all of these parts.

1654
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:41,900
Which means that to be conscious of it

1655
01:25:41,900 --> 01:25:46,440
as opposed to any of its parts requires mediation.

1656
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:49,740
So why would I say this here, this here now,

1657
01:25:49,740 --> 01:25:53,220
am I referring to the whole book rather than its parts?

1658
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:57,180
The only thing that could explain why my consciousness

1659
01:25:57,180 --> 01:26:01,140
is of this whole book rather than its parts

1660
01:26:01,140 --> 01:26:05,580
is because I'm aware of it as a book with parts

1661
01:26:05,580 --> 01:26:07,560
rather than as the parts.

1662
01:26:07,560 --> 01:26:11,460
I have to consciously separate it from its background,

1663
01:26:11,460 --> 01:26:13,340
from its environment, and from its parts

1664
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:16,620
to be conscious of it as the whole object it is.

1665
01:26:16,620 --> 01:26:19,260
The same problem applies if I want to be conscious

1666
01:26:19,260 --> 01:26:21,380
of the page as opposed to the whole book,

1667
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:24,900
I have to be conscious of the page rather than the book.

1668
01:26:24,900 --> 01:26:29,900
And that requires negation and that's a form of determinacy

1669
01:26:30,020 --> 01:26:31,500
which is a form of mediation.

1670
01:26:31,500 --> 01:26:33,900
And that is not allowed by essentially certainty.

1671
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:39,700
The here that is meant would be the point.

1672
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,780
However, the point is not, but rather as the point

1673
01:26:42,780 --> 01:26:45,060
is demonstrated as existing, the demonstrating points

1674
01:26:45,060 --> 01:26:47,260
to itself as showing itself to be not immediate knowing

1675
01:26:47,260 --> 01:26:49,180
but instead of movement from out of the many years

1676
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:50,900
which we meant into the universal here,

1677
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:52,420
which is a simple plurality of years

1678
01:26:52,420 --> 01:26:54,900
in the way that the daytime is a simple plurality of that.

1679
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:55,740
What does that mean?

1680
01:26:55,740 --> 01:26:58,980
What that means is Hegel admits the existence

1681
01:26:59,020 --> 01:27:02,060
of spatial points, but they have their being

1682
01:27:03,380 --> 01:27:07,900
in being the intersection of lines,

1683
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:11,700
which have their being in being the intersection of planes,

1684
01:27:11,700 --> 01:27:14,620
which have their being in being the intersection of solids.

1685
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:17,940
That is to say, to be conscious of a point

1686
01:27:19,220 --> 01:27:21,900
is mediated by consciousness of the line

1687
01:27:21,900 --> 01:27:23,780
that intersects at that point.

1688
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:26,800
So consciousness of a point is totally okay,

1689
01:27:26,800 --> 01:27:29,360
but it's immediate.

1690
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:30,960
Okay, now what is Hegel assuming

1691
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:32,880
about the composition of space here?

1692
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:37,880
He's assuming that it is infinitely divisible

1693
01:27:40,640 --> 01:27:42,640
because if there were,

1694
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,720
he seems to be assuming that it's infinitely divisible.

1695
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,240
I'd have to think about whether this argument

1696
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:51,000
could work without that assumption,

1697
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,480
but he does seem to be assuming that.

1698
01:27:52,480 --> 01:27:53,320
Okay.

1699
01:27:54,320 --> 01:27:57,880
Okay, so the idea is sensuous certainty says,

1700
01:27:57,880 --> 01:28:00,560
okay, look, forget all these other objects.

1701
01:28:00,560 --> 01:28:02,040
All I know is this here now,

1702
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:07,640
but now why is its consciousness of the whole pencil

1703
01:28:08,520 --> 01:28:09,960
rather than the tip of the pencil,

1704
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:10,960
the upper half of the pencil,

1705
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,560
the lower half of the pencil,

1706
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,960
the color of the pencil, et cetera?

1707
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,280
The only thing that it could do that

1708
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,320
is because it's conscious of this thing

1709
01:28:19,320 --> 01:28:20,680
as a unity of parts,

1710
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:26,560
which means it has to have a conception of the whole

1711
01:28:27,480 --> 01:28:29,000
as opposed to the parts.

1712
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:31,520
That's just to say,

1713
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:36,520
it has to have mediacy within the content of its consciousness.

1714
01:28:41,200 --> 01:28:43,120
Okay, so now to go back to this,

1715
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:46,040
so one of the classic worries

1716
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:50,120
about Hegel's critique of sensuous certainty

1717
01:28:50,240 --> 01:28:53,440
is that he's putting in sensuous certainty

1718
01:28:53,440 --> 01:28:55,720
the amount of things that sensuous certainty

1719
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:57,300
doesn't have to say.

1720
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:59,800
This is Zopan's question about,

1721
01:28:59,800 --> 01:29:01,960
it's caveman consciousness.

1722
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:05,720
Now, if sensuous certainty was literally just mute,

1723
01:29:06,620 --> 01:29:08,840
like staring at things,

1724
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:10,880
without any conception of itself as knowing,

1725
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:13,320
obviously Hegel's critique would not be imminent,

1726
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:16,200
but that just means that that can't possibly

1727
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,280
be the project of the world.

1728
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:23,440
So a shape of consciousness is a shape of consciousness.

1729
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:24,520
That is to say,

1730
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:27,060
it's something that has a conception of itself

1731
01:29:27,060 --> 01:29:28,880
as relating to an object.

1732
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,720
That means it has to have a conception

1733
01:29:31,720 --> 01:29:35,920
of why its consciousness is a consciousness of its object.

1734
01:29:38,640 --> 01:29:43,160
And Hegel is assuming that the consciousness

1735
01:29:43,160 --> 01:29:47,920
of the sensuous certainty's consciousness of its object,

1736
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:51,520
if that consciousness is not conceptually mediated,

1737
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:56,520
can't be a consciousness of a whole thing apart.

1738
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:04,480
Can you just explain what exactly the sensuous certainty

1739
01:30:04,480 --> 01:30:07,880
person can afford to distinguish without concepts?

1740
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:09,360
Is it between particulars,

1741
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:12,120
or is it between the concept of a universal

1742
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:14,760
and that of a particular?

1743
01:30:14,760 --> 01:30:16,640
So what it can say,

1744
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:19,840
so we're allowing it to say things in answer to us,

1745
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:20,920
which involves concepts,

1746
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:25,120
but what it can know involves no concepts.

1747
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:29,120
In sorry, it involves no universals.

1748
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:32,480
All it knows is this here now.

1749
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:40,560
So he tries to avoid Hegel's critique

1750
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,160
by claiming that this here now is not a universal

1751
01:30:43,160 --> 01:30:45,040
because it doesn't care about the other instances,

1752
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:46,360
it just cares about this.

1753
01:30:47,240 --> 01:30:49,280
But Hegel's point is that even this,

1754
01:30:49,280 --> 01:30:51,160
being conscious of this,

1755
01:30:51,160 --> 01:30:53,200
requires consciousness of a universal.

1756
01:30:53,200 --> 01:30:56,320
It requires a consciousness of a one over man.

1757
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:58,240
And that means it requires consciousness

1758
01:30:58,240 --> 01:31:00,520
of the one as being distinct from them,

1759
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:04,600
which is determinism, and that's a kind of mediation.

1760
01:31:06,600 --> 01:31:09,320
Now, let's go a little bit further.

1761
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:15,560
109, it is clear both that the dialectic

1762
01:31:15,600 --> 01:31:19,760
of sensuous certainty is nothing but the simple history

1763
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:23,040
of its movement that is its experience.

1764
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:26,240
So the dialectic of sensuous certainty

1765
01:31:26,240 --> 01:31:30,800
is just this sequence of experiences,

1766
01:31:30,800 --> 01:31:35,800
which is to say its awareness of apparent contradictions

1767
01:31:36,600 --> 01:31:39,720
between its consciousness of the object and the object

1768
01:31:39,720 --> 01:31:41,440
and attempts to resolve them.

1769
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:43,640
And that sensuous certainty itself is nothing

1770
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,360
but just this history.

1771
01:31:45,480 --> 01:31:47,280
So the shape of consciousness,

1772
01:31:47,280 --> 01:31:50,960
Hegel's now identifying with its own experience.

1773
01:31:50,960 --> 01:31:52,600
Or sensuous certainty is,

1774
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:54,440
this is not something happening to sensuous certainty

1775
01:31:54,440 --> 01:31:57,160
on that side, we're not doing anything to sensuous certainty.

1776
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:00,000
Sensuous certainty, just purely the concept

1777
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,920
of sensuous certainty when thought thread

1778
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:04,680
generates these problems.

1779
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:08,200
For that reason, natural consciousness also proceeds

1780
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:11,800
to this result, what is the true in sensuous certainty

1781
01:32:11,800 --> 01:32:13,920
to keep pressing the other forward.

1782
01:32:13,920 --> 01:32:16,280
It learns from experience about it,

1783
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,560
but then it likewise forgets it,

1784
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:20,880
and then it starts the whole movement all over again

1785
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:22,360
right from the beginning.

1786
01:32:22,360 --> 01:32:23,760
It is thus a bit astonishing

1787
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,600
when in the face of this experience,

1788
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,640
it is set up as a philosophical assertion,

1789
01:32:27,640 --> 01:32:29,320
whereas a universal experience,

1790
01:32:29,320 --> 01:32:31,320
or even as the outcome of skepticism,

1791
01:32:31,320 --> 01:32:34,960
that the reality or the being of external things as this

1792
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:39,760
or as sensuous is to have absolute truth for consciousness.

1793
01:32:39,760 --> 01:32:44,760
Such an assertion does not say at,

1794
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:47,600
does not say at the same, does not at the same time

1795
01:32:47,600 --> 01:32:49,160
know what it is saying.

1796
01:32:49,160 --> 01:32:50,920
It does not know what it is saying,

1797
01:32:50,920 --> 01:32:53,520
the opposite of what it wants to say.

1798
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:56,040
So sensuous certainty wants to say

1799
01:32:56,040 --> 01:32:58,920
that the object of consciousness is the pencil

1800
01:32:58,920 --> 01:33:02,600
in saying, all I know is this.

1801
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,840
But actually, this is a universal.

1802
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:09,160
In fact, this is the most abstract universal,

1803
01:33:09,160 --> 01:33:11,440
because everything is a this.

1804
01:33:11,440 --> 01:33:14,720
So now, let me turn to the theme

1805
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,960
that I said I would talk about, which is being.

1806
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:28,600
So sensuous certainty's official view is I know this.

1807
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:37,440
Now Hegel sometimes says what it knows is,

1808
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:42,440
I know this is, but that makes the object of consciousness

1809
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:46,400
complex, that is to say there's a difference

1810
01:33:46,400 --> 01:33:49,240
between the subject and the predicate.

1811
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:50,560
You can't have that.

1812
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:53,000
So we're properly speaking, what it knows is this.

1813
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:00,480
But we can also just characterize that object as it.

1814
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:04,120
What it knows is it, or being.

1815
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:10,680
Now the object of consciousness has to be completely immediate.

1816
01:34:13,920 --> 01:34:20,120
Immediacy goes with indeterminacy.

1817
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:21,760
Why?

1818
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:30,920
Because immediacy is the same or goes with determinacy.

1819
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:32,680
If something is determinate, it's

1820
01:34:32,680 --> 01:34:34,680
one thing rather than another, it

1821
01:34:34,680 --> 01:34:38,720
is what it is in virtue of what it is not.

1822
01:34:38,720 --> 01:34:43,920
So if something has a determinate color, it's red.

1823
01:34:43,920 --> 01:34:48,400
It's red in virtue of not being blue.

1824
01:34:48,400 --> 01:34:51,240
Likewise, if something is mediated,

1825
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,320
it has to be mediated by something else.

1826
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:56,480
So it has to be determinately, not that.

1827
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:59,120
Now, there is this thing called self-mediation in Hegel.

1828
01:34:59,120 --> 01:35:00,920
Something can mediate itself.

1829
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:03,680
But then there's a difference, there's

1830
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:08,280
determinacy between the role of the thing as mediator

1831
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,600
and the very same thing as mediator.

1832
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:12,080
So wherever there's mediation, there's

1833
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,840
determinacy, wherever there's determinacy, there's mediator.

1834
01:35:14,840 --> 01:35:19,600
So wherever there's lack of mediacy,

1835
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:22,320
wherever there's immediacy, there's indeterminacy.

1836
01:35:22,320 --> 01:35:26,000
So what if I know is this and it's immediate,

1837
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:28,120
it's an indeterminate this.

1838
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:30,000
Now, this is all stuff that we are saying.

1839
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:32,680
This is not something that consciousness gets at.

1840
01:35:32,680 --> 01:35:36,320
This is for us, not for some sensuous certainty.

1841
01:35:36,320 --> 01:35:40,440
What I know is the indeterminate this.

1842
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:42,840
So what sensuous certainty is saying

1843
01:35:42,840 --> 01:35:46,880
is I know this, which is not just the cosmos.

1844
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:49,000
Because the cosmos is a determinate this.

1845
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:52,960
It's the most indeterminate possible this.

1846
01:35:52,960 --> 01:35:55,840
Another way of putting that is what consciousness knows

1847
01:35:55,840 --> 01:35:59,520
is not this determinate being, but completely indeterminate

1848
01:35:59,880 --> 01:36:01,240
being.

1849
01:36:01,240 --> 01:36:07,360
What it knows is being, pure being.

1850
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:08,840
OK.

1851
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,560
That means there's a structural parallel,

1852
01:36:11,560 --> 01:36:13,760
this is just to anticipate a couple of things,

1853
01:36:13,760 --> 01:36:15,760
between sensuous certainty and the beginning

1854
01:36:15,760 --> 01:36:18,280
of the science of logic.

1855
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:20,600
The beginning of the first category of the science

1856
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:22,480
of logic is pure being.

1857
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,120
OK.

1858
01:36:23,120 --> 01:36:25,520
Now, question.

1859
01:36:25,520 --> 01:36:28,800
I myself am not really sure what I want to say about this.

1860
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:33,240
So Hegel draws a distinction between what sensuous certainty

1861
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:36,960
says and what it means.

1862
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:41,680
What it says it knows is pure being,

1863
01:36:41,680 --> 01:36:44,440
completely indeterminate being.

1864
01:36:44,440 --> 01:36:47,600
You take away all immediacy, you take all way determinacy.

1865
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:50,920
It's not that I know this being, because this being is

1866
01:36:50,920 --> 01:36:53,680
this being, a virtue of not being, some other being.

1867
01:36:53,680 --> 01:36:57,520
It's a determinate being, or a specific being,

1868
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,880
mediated by some other being.

1869
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,520
So completely immediate being, which

1870
01:37:01,520 --> 01:37:05,280
is the absolutely pure, general being.

1871
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,560
Not just not even God, because God is traditionally

1872
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:09,920
conceived of as a being, a very special being,

1873
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:13,200
but one being among others, just pure being.

1874
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:15,320
So what Hegel says is sensuous certainty

1875
01:37:15,320 --> 01:37:17,960
says what it knows is pure being.

1876
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:24,040
But what it means is it knows this being, this particular

1877
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:24,520
being.

1878
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:31,240
And so this contrast, this conflict,

1879
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:35,120
shows that this form of consciousness is incoherent.

1880
01:37:35,120 --> 01:37:38,800
But you could argue on behalf of sensuous certainty.

1881
01:37:38,800 --> 01:37:40,600
No.

1882
01:37:40,600 --> 01:37:42,560
What you've shown is that sensuous certainty

1883
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,960
knows pure being.

1884
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:46,760
Now, I'm not sure what to do with that.

1885
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:53,000
And I want to leave this open, because one

1886
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,880
of the big problems in the science of logic

1887
01:37:54,880 --> 01:37:58,680
is why, what entitles us to go beyond pure being?

1888
01:37:58,680 --> 01:38:01,880
So why can't sensuous, why isn't Hegel just proven

1889
01:38:01,880 --> 01:38:06,480
that what knowing is is the knowing of pure being?

1890
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:07,720
Done.

1891
01:38:07,720 --> 01:38:09,280
Book ends.

1892
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:19,240
Now, one thing that Hegel could say is, look,

1893
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:22,480
it might be that knowing is just the pure knowing

1894
01:38:22,480 --> 01:38:23,840
of pure being.

1895
01:38:23,840 --> 01:38:26,760
But that's not sensuous.

1896
01:38:26,760 --> 01:38:29,000
Whatever your access to pure being is,

1897
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,000
it's not through the senses.

1898
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:37,800
So that definitely is not what sensuous certainty means to me.

1899
01:38:37,800 --> 01:38:40,520
It may be what it says, but it doesn't mean to me.

1900
01:38:40,520 --> 01:38:42,240
So I just want to flag that.

1901
01:38:42,240 --> 01:38:46,840
So this distinction between what sensuous certainty says

1902
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:49,800
and what it means.

1903
01:38:49,800 --> 01:38:54,440
So first of all, general irony of the phenomenology.

1904
01:38:54,440 --> 01:38:56,800
What is for consciousness is not always

1905
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,320
the same as what is for us.

1906
01:38:58,320 --> 01:39:02,200
So certain things will seem a certain way to consciousness,

1907
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:06,840
but the observer can see that it's not that way.

1908
01:39:06,840 --> 01:39:08,960
Irony is when the apparent meaning

1909
01:39:08,960 --> 01:39:10,760
is different from the actual meaning.

1910
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:15,600
So Oedipus is like, why is there this plague affecting Athens?

1911
01:39:15,600 --> 01:39:17,400
Someone must have cured it in some terrible crime.

1912
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:18,200
I wonder who it is.

1913
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,480
And we're like, we all know why.

1914
01:39:20,480 --> 01:39:23,160
So likewise, there's an irony here

1915
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:26,240
in that sensuous certainty thinks

1916
01:39:26,240 --> 01:39:31,480
that what it knows is the super concrete sensuous particulars.

1917
01:39:31,480 --> 01:39:35,760
What it really knows is the most abstract thing of all, pure being.

1918
01:39:35,760 --> 01:39:39,240
Now, the other thing, there's a sort of historical irony here

1919
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:46,840
in that there's a famous objection by this guy named

1920
01:39:46,840 --> 01:39:52,320
Krug to basically Hegel and all of his pals,

1921
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:55,320
Fichte Schelling and Hegel, that these guys are just

1922
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:58,480
talking about these complete abstractions.

1923
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:00,480
This is all bullshit.

1924
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:03,000
The this is bullshit reaction to German idealism

1925
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:04,080
has an excellent pedigree.

1926
01:40:04,080 --> 01:40:08,240
The number one, the great advocate

1927
01:40:08,240 --> 01:40:11,680
of the this is bullshit reaction is Schopenhauer.

1928
01:40:11,680 --> 01:40:15,480
Unfortunately for Schopenhauer, his position is just Schelling's.

1929
01:40:15,480 --> 01:40:18,480
So Schelling is bullshit.

1930
01:40:21,400 --> 01:40:24,280
So when Krug says someplace, I can't remember where he says this.

1931
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:27,560
He says, look, these guys talk about deducing all this stuff

1932
01:40:27,560 --> 01:40:30,840
from pure self-conscious, just the concept of knowing.

1933
01:40:30,840 --> 01:40:32,920
OK, I'll have you a challenge.

1934
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:35,000
Deduce this pen.

1935
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:39,360
So the idea is that in these systems of German idealism,

1936
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:42,120
we never get to concrete particulars,

1937
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:46,000
that somehow they've erased all particularity or singularity

1938
01:40:46,000 --> 01:40:48,360
in these super abstract notions.

1939
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:50,320
So the other irony of such uncertainty

1940
01:40:50,320 --> 01:40:56,760
is Hegel is arguing that this, the thing that Krug

1941
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,760
is demanding a deduction of, the thing that's

1942
01:40:58,760 --> 01:41:02,200
supposed to be the most concrete particular thing possible,

1943
01:41:02,200 --> 01:41:03,800
the German idealism could ever grasp

1944
01:41:03,800 --> 01:41:08,360
is, in fact, the most abstract, purely.

1945
01:41:08,360 --> 01:41:10,480
OK.

1946
01:41:10,480 --> 01:41:14,400
Let me just think for a moment how much more I actually

1947
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:19,160
want to say.

1948
01:41:19,160 --> 01:41:21,120
OK, questions.

1949
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:22,680
Yes.

1950
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:26,280
I still kind of wonder how those questions tell you something.

1951
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:28,840
It doesn't be like your perception itself

1952
01:41:28,840 --> 01:41:29,920
has already information.

1953
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,560
It's not like three sides.

1954
01:41:31,560 --> 01:41:34,080
Or is it that I have this perception,

1955
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,480
but what it says, what it tells, involves

1956
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:41,840
some sort of inner tone, some kind of conceptualization.

1957
01:41:41,840 --> 01:41:44,280
So you're asking the question that's

1958
01:41:44,280 --> 01:41:45,840
not the question of phenomenology.

1959
01:41:45,840 --> 01:41:49,280
You're asking the question, what is perceptual experience?

1960
01:41:49,280 --> 01:41:50,680
The question of the phenomenology

1961
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:55,200
is start with shapes of consciousness

1962
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:57,480
and then undermine them internally.

1963
01:41:57,480 --> 01:41:59,440
So sensuous certainty, as I said before,

1964
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:03,400
is not as complex as the thing you're taking into it.

1965
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:07,280
It's a philosopher's construct.

1966
01:42:07,280 --> 01:42:13,040
It's just immediate sensuous apprehension of intent.

1967
01:42:13,040 --> 01:42:17,520
It means, in particular, what it says is a universal.

1968
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,160
There were questions for you, Isaac.

1969
01:42:19,160 --> 01:42:23,360
Yeah, so is the pure being here, Mass Hegel poet,

1970
01:42:23,360 --> 01:42:28,960
is that somewhat similar to Heidegger's being or not?

1971
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:31,480
So Tark and I taught a whole seminar about this.

1972
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:34,000
And I'm not sure what conclusion we came to.

1973
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:43,240
But there's no simple answer to that question.

1974
01:42:43,240 --> 01:42:47,680
And insofar as there is one, the answer has to be no.

1975
01:42:47,680 --> 01:42:52,320
Because being is what Dasein understands.

1976
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:55,840
And pure being for Hegel has no relationship

1977
01:42:55,840 --> 01:42:58,000
to any particular being.

1978
01:42:58,040 --> 01:42:59,720
It has to be more general than that.

1979
01:42:59,720 --> 01:43:01,120
Yeah.

1980
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:05,320
So if subject is purely receptive,

1981
01:43:05,320 --> 01:43:12,480
how do we know the object that we perceive for first time?

1982
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:17,680
Once again, for sensuous certainty,

1983
01:43:17,680 --> 01:43:22,360
knowing an object just is apprehending it.

1984
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:23,960
So when you see it for the first time,

1985
01:43:23,960 --> 01:43:26,280
you know it as well as you will ever know it,

1986
01:43:26,280 --> 01:43:27,800
as well as you know anything.

1987
01:43:27,880 --> 01:43:29,680
For the first time, for the second time,

1988
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:33,560
those are only relevant if knowledge is something more

1989
01:43:33,560 --> 01:43:36,040
than just apprehending something.

1990
01:43:36,040 --> 01:43:39,760
More than just, I mean, and sensuous certainty

1991
01:43:39,760 --> 01:43:42,280
has a, when I say apprehension, has a superminable notion

1992
01:43:42,280 --> 01:43:43,520
of apprehension.

1993
01:43:43,520 --> 01:43:45,760
It's not even the Kantian thing where in apprehension,

1994
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:46,800
you have to combine some.

1995
01:43:46,800 --> 01:43:48,720
It's just like, boom, it's before you.

1996
01:43:48,720 --> 01:43:58,200
The assumption or the premise implicit in your question

1997
01:43:58,200 --> 01:44:02,400
that we know something less well the first time than later,

1998
01:44:02,400 --> 01:44:05,920
assume that knowledge is a matter

1999
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:08,360
of accumulating information about something

2000
01:44:08,360 --> 01:44:10,040
through further acquaintance with it.

2001
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:12,720
But that is not sense certainty's conception

2002
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:14,200
of what knowledge is.

2003
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:15,920
Sense certainty's conception of knowledge

2004
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:24,760
is in some ways, the more unfamiliar the thing is,

2005
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:25,840
the better.

2006
01:44:25,840 --> 01:44:27,640
Because if it's unfamiliar, you're

2007
01:44:27,640 --> 01:44:29,960
just going to be like, what is this?

2008
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:35,480
The first time you see a pencil, you don't know it any better

2009
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:36,720
or any worse.

2010
01:44:36,720 --> 01:44:40,200
So the subject comes through object?

2011
01:44:40,200 --> 01:44:41,160
No.

2012
01:44:41,160 --> 01:44:47,120
The subject is immediately sensibly aware of that.

2013
01:44:47,120 --> 01:44:48,320
Yeah.

2014
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:55,240
So another question is that, is what conscience means

2015
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:57,840
identifiable to poor consciousness

2016
01:44:57,840 --> 01:45:02,480
and what you says identify or is in a cell,

2017
01:45:02,480 --> 01:45:04,800
is that identifiable or not really there

2018
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:08,320
to distinct separate, distinct distinct?

2019
01:45:08,360 --> 01:45:11,560
I mean, insofar as there's a distinction emerges

2020
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:17,880
between what it says and what it means,

2021
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:25,520
that has to become for consciousness.

2022
01:45:25,520 --> 01:45:28,240
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a problem.

2023
01:45:28,240 --> 01:45:32,120
All the problems have to be problems that eventually

2024
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:34,000
become for consciousness.

2025
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:37,000
Even if when Hegel originally introduces them,

2026
01:45:37,000 --> 01:45:39,920
they're not yet for consciousness but merely for us.

2027
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:45,720
But is what he says identifiable in the cell more like poor?

2028
01:45:45,720 --> 01:45:49,520
But what it says, like I said, I don't think

2029
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:52,120
it should be identifiable with it.

2030
01:45:52,120 --> 01:45:52,600
Yeah.

2031
01:45:52,600 --> 01:45:53,960
Devanj?

2032
01:45:53,960 --> 01:45:56,400
What does he mean when he says sublate?

2033
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:56,920
Oh, OK.

2034
01:45:56,920 --> 01:45:59,640
I was hoping someone would not ask me that question.

2035
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:02,120
And the reason is, I think, so it's totally

2036
01:46:02,120 --> 01:46:03,360
a central in Hegel.

2037
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:06,440
I just think it's easier to understand in the logic

2038
01:46:06,520 --> 01:46:09,040
because he has a whole discussion of it in the logic.

2039
01:46:09,040 --> 01:46:12,680
So the word in German is aufheben.

2040
01:46:12,680 --> 01:46:17,560
Now, aufheben, which is a separable prefix for those of you

2041
01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:22,840
who are taking German, has two totally different meanings

2042
01:46:22,840 --> 01:46:23,960
in German.

2043
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:27,960
It means both to lift something up, you have this aufgehogen.

2044
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:30,080
It also means to cancel something.

2045
01:46:30,080 --> 01:46:34,040
So if you suspend a law, you've heben this auf.

2046
01:46:34,040 --> 01:46:36,120
So Hegel loves the fact that there's

2047
01:46:36,120 --> 01:46:40,400
this word that means two completely different things.

2048
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:43,600
Now, what he means by it is something

2049
01:46:43,600 --> 01:46:47,920
is sublated aufgehogen.

2050
01:46:47,920 --> 01:46:52,400
The verb is aufgehben, but the past part is it's aufgehogen.

2051
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:58,760
It's to sublate.

2052
01:46:58,760 --> 01:47:00,120
This is sublated.

2053
01:47:05,040 --> 01:47:06,680
OK.

2054
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:13,280
So something is sublated when it is canceled but preserved

2055
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:15,400
at a higher logical level.

2056
01:47:15,400 --> 01:47:17,440
Now, what does that mean?

2057
01:47:17,440 --> 01:47:22,960
What that means, we'll give you some sort of folk examples.

2058
01:47:22,960 --> 01:47:28,840
So Hegel likes to say that the British monarch is sublated

2059
01:47:28,840 --> 01:47:31,760
in the British Constitution because there's

2060
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:36,320
no monarch, because Charles, whatever his name is,

2061
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,200
your king, not mine.

2062
01:47:39,200 --> 01:47:46,240
I am a subject of no kings, has no power.

2063
01:47:46,240 --> 01:47:51,560
His ancestors would despise his current predicament.

2064
01:47:51,560 --> 01:47:55,360
But he's still there.

2065
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,240
He's there in a transformed role.

2066
01:47:58,240 --> 01:47:59,800
So he's both there and not there.

2067
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:02,000
OK, what does that mean?

2068
01:48:02,000 --> 01:48:09,160
I think the better, the way to really answer this

2069
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:09,800
is in the logic.

2070
01:48:09,800 --> 01:48:12,280
I think it becomes much clearer in the logic.

2071
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:20,280
But yeah.

2072
01:48:20,280 --> 01:48:26,120
So the idea of sublation is that when one shape of consciousness

2073
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:29,720
undermines itself and gives rise to the next,

2074
01:48:29,720 --> 01:48:33,280
certain features of the first shape of consciousness

2075
01:48:33,280 --> 01:48:36,240
are present in the second shape of consciousness.

2076
01:48:36,240 --> 01:48:38,520
But they have a totally different meaning.

2077
01:48:38,520 --> 01:48:40,440
They're like the British monarch.

2078
01:48:40,440 --> 01:48:44,600
It's a monarch, but in nothing like the original sense.

2079
01:48:44,600 --> 01:48:52,000
It's both canceled and lifted in the back.

2080
01:48:52,000 --> 01:48:52,600
Yeah, sorry, sorry.

2081
01:48:52,600 --> 01:48:53,200
I keep missing you.

2082
01:48:53,200 --> 01:48:53,680
Sorry.

2083
01:48:53,680 --> 01:48:55,320
Yeah, your name.

2084
01:48:55,320 --> 01:48:55,800
Bowie.

2085
01:48:55,800 --> 01:48:56,280
Bowie.

2086
01:48:56,280 --> 01:48:56,800
OK.

2087
01:48:57,400 --> 01:49:00,880
I want to ask about 103, 104, and 105.

2088
01:49:00,880 --> 01:49:01,400
That's a lot.

2089
01:49:01,400 --> 01:49:02,240
No, no, no.

2090
01:49:02,240 --> 01:49:05,440
But just basically, what does Hegel mean

2091
01:49:05,440 --> 01:49:09,000
when he says that the whole of the century's consciousness

2092
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,240
is its own essence?

2093
01:49:10,240 --> 01:49:13,640
Because when he talks about I being its own essence,

2094
01:49:13,640 --> 01:49:15,240
I mean, being the essence of the century,

2095
01:49:15,240 --> 01:49:19,120
certainly he means that, oh, when I say now, it's my now.

2096
01:49:19,120 --> 01:49:21,200
But what does it mean for the whole of the century?

2097
01:49:21,200 --> 01:49:24,840
So essence is an essentially contrasted concept.

2098
01:49:24,840 --> 01:49:26,720
It's like being special.

2099
01:49:26,720 --> 01:49:30,560
If everyone is special, no one is special.

2100
01:49:30,560 --> 01:49:34,960
So if both moments of such uncertainty are the essence,

2101
01:49:34,960 --> 01:49:37,360
then there's certainly neither of them.

2102
01:49:37,360 --> 01:49:39,920
So what that means is it's not that I determine

2103
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:42,680
what the object of knowledge is, or the object

2104
01:49:42,680 --> 01:49:45,040
determines what knowledge is.

2105
01:49:45,040 --> 01:49:47,400
We're not making these distinctions anymore.

2106
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:50,960
So the move of using the eye to anchor the reference of this

2107
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:55,080
is out, because we're not considering any other of this.

2108
01:49:55,080 --> 01:49:57,840
So really, the difference is that sensuous certainty

2109
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:04,440
originally was sort of non-punctual or non- it

2110
01:50:04,440 --> 01:50:07,600
was willing to acknowledge that something outside

2111
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:12,280
of a single knowing instance was knowledge.

2112
01:50:12,280 --> 01:50:14,440
So you said, well, what about when you were perceiving

2113
01:50:14,440 --> 01:50:15,520
the tree rather than the house?

2114
01:50:15,520 --> 01:50:16,960
Oh, OK, the answer to that.

2115
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:19,920
Now it just says, I don't know what you're talking about.

2116
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:23,480
That means sensuous certainty, once both subject and object

2117
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:26,160
are equally the essence, which means certainly neither of them

2118
01:50:26,160 --> 01:50:34,680
are, that I feel like some of you are still

2119
01:50:34,680 --> 01:50:36,800
stuck at that point about everyone's special knowing

2120
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,200
is because you're like, but wait,

2121
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:40,760
my third grade teacher told us we were all like,

2122
01:50:40,760 --> 01:50:43,000
was she lying to me?

2123
01:50:43,000 --> 01:50:43,500
Sorry.

2124
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:50,440
So the idea is, sensuous certainty,

2125
01:50:50,440 --> 01:50:54,660
now that we've gotten this revised version of sensuous certainty

2126
01:50:54,660 --> 01:50:59,480
that's revised it so in order to resolve these problems,

2127
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:02,240
it knows this.

2128
01:51:02,240 --> 01:51:03,560
Now it knows this.

2129
01:51:03,560 --> 01:51:05,480
And it knows nothing about that, and doesn't want

2130
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:06,680
to hear anything about that.

2131
01:51:06,680 --> 01:51:08,000
And now it knows this.

2132
01:51:08,000 --> 01:51:11,480
It doesn't know anything about that, doesn't want to hear about that.

2133
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:12,240
That's the idea.

2134
01:51:12,240 --> 01:51:17,000
So it's giving up on any particular privilege in having it.

2135
01:51:17,000 --> 01:51:19,000
Yeah.

2136
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:22,480
I'm wondering how exactly is sensuous certainty

2137
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:25,400
is the only conception of knowledge available to itself,

2138
01:51:25,400 --> 01:51:27,880
like separate from itself?

2139
01:51:27,880 --> 01:51:32,440
Like sensuous certainty can't separate between particular pieces?

2140
01:51:32,440 --> 01:51:33,400
Yeah, so good.

2141
01:51:33,400 --> 01:51:43,720
So the very idea of a conception of knowledge requires concepts.

2142
01:51:43,720 --> 01:51:47,360
Therefore, it has to be able to conceptualize

2143
01:51:47,360 --> 01:51:50,120
it's not.

2144
01:51:50,120 --> 01:51:53,880
It has to be able to sort of say about itself what knowledge is,

2145
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:57,600
even if that doesn't go in the object of knowledge.

2146
01:51:57,600 --> 01:52:01,680
Now the worry here, so we don't want,

2147
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:04,240
so there's two extremes that we want to avoid.

2148
01:52:04,240 --> 01:52:07,480
We want to avoid on the one hand what we've been calling caveman's.

2149
01:52:07,480 --> 01:52:09,920
It's probably deep into a caveman, I apologize.

2150
01:52:09,920 --> 01:52:13,160
Caveman consciousness, where it just knows an object,

2151
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:17,760
doesn't even have a conception of itself in it.

2152
01:52:17,760 --> 01:52:19,880
It's probably more like animal consciousness.

2153
01:52:19,880 --> 01:52:26,720
On the other hand, we want to avoid a consciousness,

2154
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:30,880
or shape of consciousness, that has a conceptually

2155
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:33,680
or articulate conception of knowledge,

2156
01:52:33,680 --> 01:52:36,040
but then doesn't think that that conceptually

2157
01:52:36,040 --> 01:52:38,280
or articulate conception of knowledge

2158
01:52:38,280 --> 01:52:41,040
is one of the objects of its knowledge,

2159
01:52:41,040 --> 01:52:43,360
and can make the following move.

2160
01:52:43,360 --> 01:52:49,200
It can say, oh, look, I can explain why the object of my knowledge

2161
01:52:49,200 --> 01:52:51,640
is the pencil, rather than the parts of the pencil,

2162
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:54,360
by using concepts.

2163
01:52:54,360 --> 01:52:58,000
But the object of my consciousness, the object of my knowledge,

2164
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,520
is non-conception.

2165
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:03,240
You see what the problem is?

2166
01:53:03,240 --> 01:53:06,840
Because then it could answer Hegel's critique,

2167
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:08,960
while remaining sensuous certainty

2168
01:53:08,960 --> 01:53:11,360
in its conception of knowledge.

2169
01:53:11,360 --> 01:53:15,560
So the worry is that sensuous certainty can answer Hegel's

2170
01:53:15,560 --> 01:53:21,120
criticism by saying, oh, in my conceptually

2171
01:53:21,120 --> 01:53:24,280
or articulate account of what knowledge is,

2172
01:53:24,280 --> 01:53:27,840
I can explain why my consciousness is consciousness

2173
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:30,320
of this object rather than that object,

2174
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:33,120
even though none of the stuff that I just said

2175
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:36,080
can be among the objects of consciousness.

2176
01:53:36,080 --> 01:53:38,040
And so we need a principled reason

2177
01:53:38,040 --> 01:53:43,120
for locating sensuous certainty between the skill of caveman

2178
01:53:43,120 --> 01:53:48,040
consciousness and the caribdis of overly conceptually

2179
01:53:48,040 --> 01:53:52,160
sophisticated sensuous certainty.

2180
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:54,760
And it's possible.

2181
01:53:54,760 --> 01:53:56,760
So I said before, one worry that people

2182
01:53:56,760 --> 01:53:58,960
have had about sensuous certainty for a long time

2183
01:53:58,960 --> 01:54:02,520
is Hegel is making sensuous certainty answer questions

2184
01:54:02,520 --> 01:54:05,440
it doesn't have to answer or can't answer.

2185
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:08,080
That's sort of the worry about caveman consciousness.

2186
01:54:08,080 --> 01:54:11,600
The worry about what I'm calling conceptually sophisticated

2187
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:16,920
sensuous certainty is it can answer Hegel's critique.

2188
01:54:16,920 --> 01:54:20,040
But the material it uses to answer Hegel's critique

2189
01:54:20,040 --> 01:54:22,280
doesn't go in the object of consciousness.

2190
01:54:22,280 --> 01:54:23,820
It's not one of the things it knows,

2191
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:26,280
or one of the things it's conscious of.

2192
01:54:26,280 --> 01:54:31,680
It's meta philosophical, or it's meta epistemological account

2193
01:54:31,680 --> 01:54:35,040
of what the object of consciousness is.

2194
01:54:35,040 --> 01:54:38,520
So fully defending Hegel would require explaining

2195
01:54:38,520 --> 01:54:43,640
our principle way why that is not a legitimate move.

2196
01:54:46,600 --> 01:54:47,400
Yes, so far.

2197
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:48,200
Sensuous search.

2198
01:54:48,200 --> 01:54:50,480
So who is it fighting with?

2199
01:54:50,480 --> 01:54:52,240
That's a phrase to use.

2200
01:54:52,240 --> 01:54:53,080
It's some.

2201
01:54:53,080 --> 01:54:53,600
OK.

2202
01:54:53,600 --> 01:54:55,760
Yeah, it's some.

2203
01:54:55,760 --> 01:54:56,280
Yes.

2204
01:54:56,280 --> 01:54:58,520
Why can't universality or universality

2205
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:00,600
be known immediately?

2206
01:55:00,600 --> 01:55:05,800
This is a sort of, so a universal can't be

2207
01:55:05,800 --> 01:55:08,920
known as a universal immediately.

2208
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:11,280
Because to know something as a universal,

2209
01:55:11,280 --> 01:55:15,400
you have to distinguish it from a predicament.

2210
01:55:15,400 --> 01:55:18,480
So to be conscious of something as a universal,

2211
01:55:18,480 --> 01:55:22,080
you have to be aware of it as a one over many.

2212
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:25,240
And that requires us distinct from the many.

2213
01:55:25,240 --> 01:55:26,840
But why is it not the other way around?

2214
01:55:26,840 --> 01:55:29,680
That you first understand this unity to things

2215
01:55:29,680 --> 01:55:32,240
and then you can understand particulars.

2216
01:55:32,240 --> 01:55:35,120
Why do we have to understand distinct particulars first

2217
01:55:35,120 --> 01:55:38,080
in order to understand what a universal is?

2218
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,840
I mean, the same thing.

2219
01:55:39,840 --> 01:55:41,680
I didn't say you have to understand the particulars

2220
01:55:41,680 --> 01:55:42,160
first.

2221
01:55:42,160 --> 01:55:44,240
To understand a particular is a particular.

2222
01:55:44,240 --> 01:55:47,040
You also have to understand it as distinct from potentially

2223
01:55:47,040 --> 01:55:50,640
other particulars and from universals that it realizes.

2224
01:55:50,640 --> 01:55:54,760
So that's also media.

2225
01:55:54,760 --> 01:56:02,880
So the immediate, the thing that you know immediately

2226
01:56:02,880 --> 01:56:12,440
is this, which now, sensuous certainty doesn't say of it

2227
01:56:12,440 --> 01:56:13,680
that it's a universal.

2228
01:56:13,680 --> 01:56:16,240
Because it's not aware of it as a universal.

2229
01:56:16,240 --> 01:56:20,360
We, the chronological observers, are aware of it as a universal.

2230
01:56:20,360 --> 01:56:25,640
Let me ask, how many of you are totally lost?

2231
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,880
Raise your hand if you are totally lost.

2232
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:30,840
Someone, OK, there's 0% chance that only three of you

2233
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:32,040
are totally lost.

2234
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:32,800
Just be honest.

2235
01:56:35,840 --> 01:56:36,680
OK.

2236
01:56:36,680 --> 01:56:40,360
Someone who is totally lost, tell me

2237
01:56:40,360 --> 01:56:44,480
the last place in which you were not lost.

2238
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:46,080
Where did you get lost?

2239
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:47,840
Someone we have not heard from yet.

2240
01:56:50,480 --> 01:56:52,480
I saw some hands in the background.

2241
01:56:55,640 --> 01:56:57,560
Anybody?

2242
01:56:57,560 --> 01:56:58,760
OK, Krista.

2243
01:56:58,760 --> 01:57:00,400
I'm not sure you're going to be like,

2244
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:03,320
I got lost at this place, which is way further along

2245
01:57:03,320 --> 01:57:05,560
than where other people got lost.

2246
01:57:05,560 --> 01:57:11,040
So how do we get to pure being and what

2247
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,680
sensory sense is pure being?

2248
01:57:13,680 --> 01:57:16,040
So the way we get to pure being is, first of all,

2249
01:57:16,040 --> 01:57:22,840
we just assume that the object of knowledge is what it is.

2250
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:24,520
You only know what it is.

2251
01:57:24,520 --> 01:57:29,640
Now, sensuous certainty is immediate consciousness.

2252
01:57:29,640 --> 01:57:34,400
That means what it is conscious of can't be determined.

2253
01:57:34,400 --> 01:57:37,800
Because determinacy always involves idiomatic.

2254
01:57:37,800 --> 01:57:41,240
That means it cannot be contrast of a particular being.

2255
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:47,920
That means it cannot be conscious of a determinate being,

2256
01:57:47,920 --> 01:57:50,720
one being as opposed to another being.

2257
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:54,200
Because to be conscious of one being as opposed to another being,

2258
01:57:54,200 --> 01:58:01,200
a determinate being, requires negation, which is a kind of mediation.

2259
01:58:01,200 --> 01:58:04,680
That means because it's conscious of what is,

2260
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:07,040
because all knowledge is knowledge of what is,

2261
01:58:07,040 --> 01:58:10,400
it's not knowledge of a determinate being,

2262
01:58:10,400 --> 01:58:14,680
any determinate being, or even a very indeterminate being.

2263
01:58:14,680 --> 01:58:20,240
It's conscious of indeterminate pure being without any determinacy.

2264
01:58:20,240 --> 01:58:24,760
So pure being is not a very special being.

2265
01:58:24,760 --> 01:58:27,600
It's not the universal being, because that

2266
01:58:27,600 --> 01:58:31,200
would be determinate or universal rather than a particular.

2267
01:58:31,200 --> 01:58:34,160
It's not God.

2268
01:58:34,280 --> 01:58:37,800
It's not the so-called bear particular, because that's

2269
01:58:37,800 --> 01:58:39,800
a particular rather than a universal.

2270
01:58:39,800 --> 01:58:43,560
It's just being.

2271
01:58:43,560 --> 01:58:47,960
It's what Parmenides is talking about.

2272
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:52,320
OK, I'm sorry, I don't know your name.

2273
01:58:52,320 --> 01:58:54,480
Did you say you were lost?

2274
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:55,960
Eventually, I didn't get lost.

2275
01:58:55,960 --> 01:58:59,200
Do you want to tell me the last place where you were not lost?

2276
01:58:59,200 --> 01:59:00,360
Did you trace your steps?

2277
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:02,360
No, I wasn't around the being thing.

2278
01:59:02,360 --> 01:59:03,480
OK, that's great.

2279
01:59:04,240 --> 01:59:06,920
If you only got lost at being, you're doing very good.

2280
01:59:06,920 --> 01:59:10,480
Being is a very respectable place to get lost at.

2281
01:59:10,480 --> 01:59:16,960
I got lost the move of using the eye to anchor this.

2282
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:24,600
So the idea is Hegel says, look, here and now are universals,

2283
01:59:24,600 --> 01:59:29,400
because that's a here, that's a here, that's a here.

2284
01:59:29,400 --> 01:59:31,200
Every time is a now.

2285
01:59:31,200 --> 01:59:33,360
Consciousness says, OK, this is a version

2286
01:59:33,360 --> 01:59:35,400
of making the indexical move.

2287
01:59:35,400 --> 01:59:41,320
It says, here is wherever I am, and now

2288
01:59:41,320 --> 01:59:43,360
is whenever I am speaking.

2289
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:45,040
OK, good.

2290
01:59:45,040 --> 01:59:49,680
But now notice, I is also a universal or an indexical.

2291
01:59:49,680 --> 01:59:52,520
You can say I, I can say I, everyone here can.

2292
01:59:52,520 --> 01:59:55,960
I'm assuming everyone here can say I.

2293
01:59:55,960 --> 02:00:00,240
That means that for consciousness to use that move,

2294
02:00:00,240 --> 02:00:03,440
it has to distinguish its eye from other eyes.

2295
02:00:03,440 --> 02:00:06,480
That is just as to say, I, as uttered by any speaker,

2296
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:10,400
S, refers to X. But that requires

2297
02:00:10,400 --> 02:00:14,680
the difference between a particular instance

2298
02:00:14,680 --> 02:00:19,080
of the variable and the general term binding the variable.

2299
02:00:19,080 --> 02:00:20,760
And that's a version of the distinction

2300
02:00:20,760 --> 02:00:22,400
between particulars and traversals.

2301
02:00:22,400 --> 02:00:25,280
That requires negations.

2302
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:29,200
That's a form of determinacy, and it can't do that.

2303
02:00:29,640 --> 02:00:31,720
Is the order a matter of whether Hegel

2304
02:00:31,720 --> 02:00:33,880
does time first or space first?

2305
02:00:33,880 --> 02:00:34,800
I don't think so.

2306
02:00:34,800 --> 02:00:36,320
That's a good question.

2307
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:40,480
But he does time in both cases first, and I'm not sure why.

2308
02:00:40,480 --> 02:00:42,560
Yes?

2309
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:43,920
No, you.

2310
02:00:43,920 --> 02:00:48,720
Just why can't determination or distinction be given immediately?

2311
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:52,120
Because I feel like I can immediately see differences.

2312
02:00:52,120 --> 02:00:54,040
This is a really good question, and it's

2313
02:00:54,040 --> 02:00:57,960
totally foundational in Hegel that he doesn't think

2314
02:00:57,960 --> 02:00:59,120
that it can be.

2315
02:00:59,920 --> 02:01:04,800
Now, for a really good argument, we have not seen one yet.

2316
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:07,240
But the basic idea, it's in a certain way,

2317
02:01:07,240 --> 02:01:09,640
it's a version of the Kantian points

2318
02:01:09,640 --> 02:01:12,080
that the combination of the manifold

2319
02:01:12,080 --> 02:01:14,920
is not given by the senses.

2320
02:01:14,920 --> 02:01:19,480
If any immediate form of awareness,

2321
02:01:19,480 --> 02:01:23,800
not by means of anything else, does not

2322
02:01:23,800 --> 02:01:28,680
acquaint you with anything that's determinate.

2323
02:01:28,680 --> 02:01:30,840
Determinately one way rather than another.

2324
02:01:30,840 --> 02:01:33,600
For it to be determinately one way rather than another,

2325
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:37,560
you have to be aware of it as determinately one way

2326
02:01:37,560 --> 02:01:38,440
rather than the other.

2327
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:40,040
And that means your awareness of it

2328
02:01:40,040 --> 02:01:43,680
is that way is mediated by your awareness of the ways

2329
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:45,760
it might otherwise be.

2330
02:01:45,760 --> 02:01:50,200
This is so foundational for Hegel.

2331
02:01:50,200 --> 02:01:53,400
I'm not even sure he ever argued sort of.

2332
02:01:53,400 --> 02:01:56,080
An immediate relation is a relation

2333
02:01:56,080 --> 02:01:58,520
to something indeterminate.

2334
02:01:58,520 --> 02:02:02,000
And that means all of the immediate stuff.

2335
02:02:02,000 --> 02:02:06,320
So people in this period love appealing

2336
02:02:06,320 --> 02:02:08,360
to immediate awareness of things.

2337
02:02:08,360 --> 02:02:10,960
And the Hegelian move repeated over and over

2338
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:15,400
is that makes the object of your awareness totally indeterminate.

2339
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:17,400
OK, now here's a challenging question.

2340
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:25,200
Is any of this in sensual certainty a criticism of Kant?

2341
02:02:25,200 --> 02:02:30,120
Does Kant have to disagree with any of any in sensual certainty?

2342
02:02:33,800 --> 02:02:35,440
You want to take a stab at it?

2343
02:02:35,440 --> 02:02:38,000
There might be a way in which if you read Kant's definition

2344
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,320
of intuition at the beginning, that this is just

2345
02:02:40,320 --> 02:02:42,680
an attack on that conception, that you can be immediately

2346
02:02:42,680 --> 02:02:44,520
related to the object.

2347
02:02:44,520 --> 02:02:48,480
OK, so on one way of thinking about this,

2348
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:52,240
this is a criticism of Kant's notion of intuition.

2349
02:02:52,240 --> 02:02:55,800
Because intuition is an immediate relation.

2350
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:58,320
And Kant thinks it's an immediate relation

2351
02:02:58,320 --> 02:03:00,560
to a determinate object.

2352
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:04,880
That's the intuition of this object rather than another.

2353
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:12,440
But you could also think Kant completely

2354
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:18,360
agrees that in order for you to be conscious of your intuition

2355
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:20,480
as being of one object rather than another,

2356
02:03:20,480 --> 02:03:23,600
you have to conceptualize it.

2357
02:03:23,600 --> 02:03:25,600
So it's not at all clear that Kant

2358
02:03:25,600 --> 02:03:29,760
has to disagree with it like this.

2359
02:03:29,760 --> 02:03:36,360
So let me just repeat that line of thought very briefly.

2360
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:38,960
So one reading of Kant, which I don't think

2361
02:03:38,960 --> 02:03:40,600
is a right reading but simply upheld,

2362
02:03:40,600 --> 02:03:43,480
is that intuitions, because they are immediate,

2363
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:45,920
are completely indeterminate.

2364
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:50,320
The object of intuition without concept is just totally indeterminate.

2365
02:03:50,320 --> 02:03:52,600
I think that doesn't make any sense in Kant.

2366
02:03:52,600 --> 02:03:57,080
But if that's what Kant's view, then Hegel's just making his point forward.

2367
02:03:57,080 --> 02:04:00,800
I think it's much more plausible that Kant thinks that intuition

2368
02:04:00,800 --> 02:04:02,920
is an intuition of a determinate object.

2369
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:04,320
It's a particular object.

2370
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:05,680
It's an intuition of this object.

2371
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:09,520
It's not just an intuition of objects that are indeterminate.

2372
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:14,680
But Kant can, I think, acknowledge the point here by saying, oh, that's right.

2373
02:04:14,680 --> 02:04:18,280
But in order for you to be conscious of that object of intuition

2374
02:04:18,280 --> 02:04:23,920
as the object of that intuition, you need to conceptualize it.

2375
02:04:23,920 --> 02:04:24,680
Yes?

2376
02:04:24,680 --> 02:04:25,240
Yeah.

2377
02:04:25,240 --> 02:04:28,920
Just one question about that last comparison between the two

2378
02:04:28,920 --> 02:04:29,960
that you made.

2379
02:04:29,960 --> 02:04:32,720
It seems to me when you're talking about the object for Hegel,

2380
02:04:32,720 --> 02:04:35,680
that seems much more broad than the object for Kant.

2381
02:04:35,680 --> 02:04:37,840
I think we would grant that the object does need

2382
02:04:37,840 --> 02:04:39,440
to fall under concepts for Kant.

2383
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:45,440
But it seems like there are things that when Kant wouldn't consider an object,

2384
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:48,200
but you suggest that Hegel maybe would.

2385
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:49,960
And that would seem to maybe.

2386
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:53,120
So object at this point is supposed to be totally general.

2387
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:55,000
It's the object of consciousness.

2388
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:57,720
The only more specific notion of object that we've seen

2389
02:04:57,720 --> 02:04:59,400
is the object of sensuous certainty.

2390
02:04:59,400 --> 02:05:02,480
And that's quite determinate.

2391
02:05:02,480 --> 02:05:05,440
It's intended to be a very determinate conception of an object.

2392
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:07,960
Something you can be sensuously certain of.

2393
02:05:07,960 --> 02:05:10,240
You can't be sensuously certain of God.

2394
02:05:10,240 --> 02:05:12,520
You can't be sensuously certain of the laws of nature.

2395
02:05:12,520 --> 02:05:13,560
You don't sense them.

2396
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:16,280
You can't be sensuously certain of propositions inside of it.

2397
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:19,400
So we can see the most general possible notion of object at all,

2398
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:23,560
and an attempt at a highly determinate one, where the highly

2399
02:05:23,560 --> 02:05:26,320
determinate one has Hegel or he's fate.

2400
02:05:29,640 --> 02:05:33,680
I'm tempted to think that Kant would just say everything even concepts

2401
02:05:33,680 --> 02:05:36,600
are immediate because of self-consciousness.

2402
02:05:36,600 --> 02:05:42,240
So then there's no real problem for him that, for example,

2403
02:05:42,240 --> 02:05:47,080
to think that we can't immediately know what universal means.

2404
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:50,280
Because everything's kind of immediate.

2405
02:05:50,280 --> 02:05:54,040
Sorry, did you say immediate or immediate?

2406
02:05:54,040 --> 02:05:55,320
Immediate.

2407
02:05:55,320 --> 02:05:59,640
But Kant's conceptual representation is immediate representation.

2408
02:05:59,640 --> 02:06:03,920
To have a concept is to represent something

2409
02:06:03,920 --> 02:06:07,240
by means of the marks of that concept.

2410
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:13,400
So conceptual representation, as such, is immediate.

2411
02:06:13,400 --> 02:06:17,760
What about just unity of app perception, the baseline?

2412
02:06:17,760 --> 02:06:19,640
Is that kind of immediate?

2413
02:06:19,640 --> 02:06:24,760
And from there, you can just know how things are like?

2414
02:06:24,760 --> 02:06:29,080
So I'm immediately conscious of myself as combining.

2415
02:06:29,080 --> 02:06:31,280
But in order for me to be conscious of anything,

2416
02:06:31,280 --> 02:06:33,680
something has to be given to me in tuition.

2417
02:06:33,680 --> 02:06:35,320
And I have to conceptualize it.

2418
02:06:35,320 --> 02:06:39,120
So you're right, I'm immediately conscious of myself as acting.

2419
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:44,640
But what Hegel would say is that I is totally indeterminate.

2420
02:06:44,640 --> 02:06:45,680
That's kind of the point.

2421
02:06:45,680 --> 02:06:46,600
It's totally empty.

2422
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:48,120
The I has no content.

2423
02:06:48,120 --> 02:06:51,500
So Hegel would actually think that, on that point,

2424
02:06:51,500 --> 02:06:53,760
Kant completely agrees with it.

2425
02:06:53,760 --> 02:06:57,960
But I'm worried that we're kind of losing everybody with Kant.

2426
02:06:57,960 --> 02:06:59,120
Yes, sorry.

2427
02:06:59,120 --> 02:07:02,480
Just one more comment.

2428
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:02,960
Great.

2429
02:07:02,960 --> 02:07:04,040
I think it was all met.

2430
02:07:04,040 --> 02:07:07,640
Is there an issue with Hegel's specific case in time

2431
02:07:07,640 --> 02:07:11,000
as you adrift with it or not?

2432
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:12,120
Yes.

2433
02:07:12,120 --> 02:07:19,200
Depending on how strongly, it depends on what

2434
02:07:19,200 --> 02:07:21,800
Hegel means by calling space and time universal.

2435
02:07:21,800 --> 02:07:25,400
I think all he means by universal is a one over met.

2436
02:07:25,400 --> 02:07:28,560
And in that very minimal sense, space and time

2437
02:07:28,560 --> 02:07:30,520
are ones over many in Kant.

2438
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:32,720
They're not conceptual universals.

2439
02:07:32,720 --> 02:07:34,200
But yeah, that's a good question.

2440
02:07:34,200 --> 02:07:38,400
I guess you repeat your indexical formulation

2441
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:40,320
of the universality of the I.

2442
02:07:40,320 --> 02:07:41,200
Oh, absolutely.

2443
02:07:43,880 --> 02:07:45,040
I would love to do that.

2444
02:07:45,040 --> 02:07:47,680
OK.

2445
02:07:47,680 --> 02:08:11,640
Or any speaker S I has uttered by mass refers to S.

2446
02:08:11,640 --> 02:08:15,520
Seems unarguable.

2447
02:08:15,520 --> 02:08:17,360
What did you learn today in philosophy class?

2448
02:08:17,360 --> 02:08:21,200
Well, we learned whenever anyone says I, I refers to them,

2449
02:08:21,200 --> 02:08:23,880
the person who said it.

2450
02:08:23,880 --> 02:08:26,640
How much is the tuition of the school is?

2451
02:08:26,640 --> 02:08:32,320
So the idea is notice that this requires

2452
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:35,560
a difference between the universal speaker

2453
02:08:35,560 --> 02:08:38,440
and individual values of this variable.

2454
02:08:38,440 --> 02:08:41,640
If we wrote this out, it would start with the quantifiable

2455
02:08:41,640 --> 02:08:46,360
clause for all S. If S is a speaker,

2456
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:49,440
and that just has contained within it

2457
02:08:49,440 --> 02:08:52,040
the difference between a particular and a universal,

2458
02:08:52,040 --> 02:08:55,240
that involves mediation, it involves determinacy.

2459
02:08:55,240 --> 02:08:59,040
None of that can be in the content of what

2460
02:08:59,040 --> 02:09:01,160
sensuous certainty is conscious of.

2461
02:09:01,160 --> 02:09:04,160
Now, the question that I was talking about before

2462
02:09:04,160 --> 02:09:07,600
is whether it could be something sensuous certainty could

2463
02:09:07,600 --> 02:09:13,360
say in order to explain the reference of its consciousness

2464
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:16,160
to an object, even though it's not something it's conscious of.

2465
02:09:16,160 --> 02:09:17,960
And that gets into the difficult question of,

2466
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:20,280
how conceptually sophisticated are we

2467
02:09:20,280 --> 02:09:22,840
allowed to make sensuous certainty?

2468
02:09:22,840 --> 02:09:24,320
Willow, you have your head up.

2469
02:09:24,320 --> 02:09:26,160
No, he's got 109.

2470
02:09:26,160 --> 02:09:26,680
OK.

2471
02:09:26,680 --> 02:09:27,840
I understood.

2472
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:30,880
Or are you going to ask me the series of Vakas?

2473
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:33,080
I mean, if you want to add it to it.

2474
02:09:33,080 --> 02:09:34,000
You have to ask me.

2475
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:34,960
Sure, sure.

2476
02:09:34,960 --> 02:09:36,000
Well, what are they?

2477
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:37,120
I just read off the bad.

2478
02:09:37,120 --> 02:09:38,720
Well, they're Roman gods.

2479
02:09:38,720 --> 02:09:39,240
You know that.

2480
02:09:39,240 --> 02:09:39,560
There you go.

2481
02:09:39,560 --> 02:09:40,320
Yes, I do know that.

2482
02:09:40,320 --> 02:09:41,120
OK.

2483
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:42,200
That's not what I would do.

2484
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:42,700
OK.

2485
02:09:42,860 --> 02:09:47,780
What I was curious about, anyway, was the so I understood you

2486
02:09:47,780 --> 02:09:53,500
as saying that sensuous sort of, you know,

2487
02:09:53,500 --> 02:09:55,500
says it knows pure being, but really knows

2488
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:57,900
this specific thing, this pencil, whatever.

2489
02:09:57,900 --> 02:10:02,100
And then it's an issue that you can't know pure being

2490
02:10:02,100 --> 02:10:04,100
through your senses and whatnot.

2491
02:10:04,100 --> 02:10:05,980
Where does that come from?

2492
02:10:05,980 --> 02:10:07,980
You know, you can't know it through your senses.

2493
02:10:07,980 --> 02:10:10,620
That does seem obvious to me, but would this have to be given?

2494
02:10:10,900 --> 02:10:15,380
So it doesn't come up here, such as the series of Vakas passage.

2495
02:10:15,380 --> 02:10:18,740
So it was a response to a worry that you might have.

2496
02:10:18,740 --> 02:10:22,860
Hegel is assuming that by having demonstrated

2497
02:10:22,860 --> 02:10:26,980
that what sensuous certainty can say of its object,

2498
02:10:26,980 --> 02:10:29,340
namely that it's pure being, cannot be

2499
02:10:29,340 --> 02:10:31,620
what it means to be its object.

2500
02:10:31,620 --> 02:10:33,740
But then why couldn't sensuous certainty just

2501
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:36,060
say, this is a question that as far as I know,

2502
02:10:36,060 --> 02:10:38,380
Hegel doesn't address, that, oh, no, no.

2503
02:10:39,260 --> 02:10:41,620
That's both what I said and what I meant to be my object.

2504
02:10:41,620 --> 02:10:43,500
The object of sensuous certainty is pure being.

2505
02:10:46,340 --> 02:10:47,620
And he doesn't address this.

2506
02:10:47,620 --> 02:10:51,300
Now then you might say, well, OK, how could sensibility,

2507
02:10:51,300 --> 02:10:54,740
how could the senses acquaint you with pure being?

2508
02:10:54,740 --> 02:10:56,940
But now I will talk about series in Vakas.

2509
02:10:56,940 --> 02:10:58,420
So this is a great passage.

2510
02:10:58,420 --> 02:11:00,260
With its appeal to universal experience,

2511
02:11:00,260 --> 02:11:02,620
we may be participating to anticipate concerns

2512
02:11:02,620 --> 02:11:04,020
in the practical sense.

2513
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:06,340
So the phenomenology is not just about theoretical knowledge,

2514
02:11:06,340 --> 02:11:08,860
it's also about practical knowledge, knowledgeable is good.

2515
02:11:08,860 --> 02:11:11,020
In this respect, what one can say

2516
02:11:11,020 --> 02:11:13,260
to those who make assertions about the truth and reality

2517
02:11:13,260 --> 02:11:16,380
of sensuous objects is that they should be sent back

2518
02:11:16,380 --> 02:11:18,900
to the most elementary school of wisdom,

2519
02:11:18,900 --> 02:11:23,780
namely to the old Ellucidian secrets of Ceres and Vakas.

2520
02:11:23,780 --> 02:11:27,260
So the Ellucidian mysteries are this mystery cult

2521
02:11:27,260 --> 02:11:31,300
in ancient Greece that you would be inducted into,

2522
02:11:31,300 --> 02:11:34,620
and you would be taught various cosmic truths

2523
02:11:34,620 --> 02:11:37,100
about the universe that we don't know that much about it.

2524
02:11:37,100 --> 02:11:42,300
But Hegel knows as much as anyone in the 19th century

2525
02:11:42,300 --> 02:11:46,820
other than Schelling about classical antiquity.

2526
02:11:46,820 --> 02:11:52,180
And he has a view about what the esoteric doctrine, the insider

2527
02:11:52,180 --> 02:11:54,460
teaching of the Ellucidian mystery cult was.

2528
02:11:54,460 --> 02:11:55,960
And he's about to tell us what is.

2529
02:11:55,960 --> 02:11:58,820
And they have yet to learn the secret of the eating of the bread

2530
02:11:58,820 --> 02:12:01,100
and drinking of the wine.

2531
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:04,340
This is so because the person who has been initiated into these secrets

2532
02:12:04,380 --> 02:12:07,500
not only comes to doubt the being of sensuous things,

2533
02:12:07,500 --> 02:12:10,540
but rather it arrives at despair about them.

2534
02:12:10,540 --> 02:12:13,020
In part, he brings about their nothingness.

2535
02:12:13,020 --> 02:12:17,660
And in part, he seems them to seize them to do it to themselves.

2536
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:22,620
So what Hegel is referencing is the fact that on his view,

2537
02:12:22,620 --> 02:12:25,820
what you learned in the Ellucidian mysteries

2538
02:12:25,820 --> 02:12:31,020
was that no individual being has any reality.

2539
02:12:31,020 --> 02:12:34,740
And you learned this by basically taking a lot of drugs.

2540
02:12:34,740 --> 02:12:36,020
I'm totally serious.

2541
02:12:36,020 --> 02:12:37,420
This is almost certainly true.

2542
02:12:37,420 --> 02:12:39,260
Almost certainly true of all these ancient mystery

2543
02:12:39,260 --> 02:12:42,340
cults were based on the heavy use of all this magic.

2544
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:45,460
That's like you can actually prove this archaeologically

2545
02:12:45,460 --> 02:12:48,140
because you can get plant residue from these various bowls

2546
02:12:48,140 --> 02:12:51,060
and you can figure out what psychedelics they use.

2547
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:53,420
You take a bunch of psychedelics, and then they would perform

2548
02:12:53,420 --> 02:12:54,940
these little pageants for you.

2549
02:12:54,940 --> 02:12:57,420
And then the point on Hegel's interpretation,

2550
02:12:57,420 --> 02:12:59,580
the point of the pageant was to discover

2551
02:12:59,580 --> 02:13:02,820
that no finite being has any reality.

2552
02:13:02,820 --> 02:13:06,460
The only being that's real is pure being.

2553
02:13:06,460 --> 02:13:10,020
So the point is the people who insist

2554
02:13:10,020 --> 02:13:13,660
on the reality of individual things, the sensuous certainty

2555
02:13:13,660 --> 02:13:18,860
person, needs to go do the Ellucidian mysteries.

2556
02:13:18,860 --> 02:13:21,940
And what they'll see is that's the true result of their view,

2557
02:13:21,940 --> 02:13:25,300
that the only thing that's real is pure being.

2558
02:13:25,300 --> 02:13:27,300
Now what are the animals excluded from this wisdom?

2559
02:13:27,300 --> 02:13:28,780
Instead, they prove themselves to be

2560
02:13:28,780 --> 02:13:30,620
the most deeply initiated into it,

2561
02:13:30,620 --> 02:13:33,180
for they do not stand still in the face of sensuous things

2562
02:13:33,180 --> 02:13:35,220
as if those things existed in themselves.

2563
02:13:35,220 --> 02:13:36,980
Despairing of the reality of those things

2564
02:13:36,980 --> 02:13:39,420
and in the total certainty of the nullity of those things,

2565
02:13:39,420 --> 02:13:41,180
they without any further ado simply

2566
02:13:41,180 --> 02:13:43,380
help themselves to them and devour them.

2567
02:13:43,380 --> 02:13:45,020
Just like the animals, all of nature

2568
02:13:45,020 --> 02:13:46,780
celebrates these revealed mysteries,

2569
02:13:46,780 --> 02:13:51,260
which teach the truth about sensuous things.

2570
02:13:51,260 --> 02:13:53,700
So Hegel is saying, even the animals know better

2571
02:13:53,700 --> 02:13:55,580
than the sensuous certainty person,

2572
02:13:55,580 --> 02:13:57,780
they know that finite things don't have any reality

2573
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:59,900
because you can just eat them.

2574
02:13:59,900 --> 02:14:01,660
So is that just a joke?

2575
02:14:01,660 --> 02:14:03,020
It's not just a joke.

2576
02:14:03,020 --> 02:14:06,340
Because Hegel's view, Hegel's true view,

2577
02:14:06,340 --> 02:14:08,860
he's not someone who believes that the only thing that's

2578
02:14:08,860 --> 02:14:10,220
real is pure being.

2579
02:14:10,220 --> 02:14:14,060
That view is called a cosmose.

2580
02:14:14,060 --> 02:14:20,620
It's the view that denies the existence of the cosmos,

2581
02:14:20,620 --> 02:14:24,500
where we take the cosmos to mean determinate beings,

2582
02:14:24,500 --> 02:14:28,260
determinate or find ideas.

2583
02:14:28,260 --> 02:14:32,140
So if an atheist is someone who denies the existence of God,

2584
02:14:32,140 --> 02:14:35,820
and a cosmist is someone who denies the existence of beings,

2585
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:37,620
there's only pure being.

2586
02:14:37,620 --> 02:14:41,460
Now Hegel, I'm sort of obsessed with this.

2587
02:14:41,460 --> 02:14:43,380
Some of you heard me talk about this many, many times.

2588
02:14:43,380 --> 02:14:44,900
This is one of my great hobby horses.

2589
02:14:44,900 --> 02:14:49,060
Hegel is obsessed with refuting a cosmose.

2590
02:14:49,060 --> 02:14:56,900
In fact, the science of logic, in a less temperate moment,

2591
02:14:56,900 --> 02:14:58,940
I would say Hegel's entire philosophical project

2592
02:14:58,940 --> 02:15:00,660
consists in the reputation of a cosmose.

2593
02:15:00,660 --> 02:15:02,340
That's a little bit of an exaggeration.

2594
02:15:02,340 --> 02:15:05,300
But his view about the North, so Hegel

2595
02:15:05,300 --> 02:15:08,540
does not think that the Eleusinian mysteries are

2596
02:15:08,540 --> 02:15:09,540
getting you at the truth.

2597
02:15:09,540 --> 02:15:11,500
Namely, all there is is pure being and finite things

2598
02:15:11,500 --> 02:15:12,860
have no reality.

2599
02:15:12,860 --> 02:15:15,260
He thinks that view is incoherent.

2600
02:15:15,260 --> 02:15:17,260
Because if they have no finite reality,

2601
02:15:17,260 --> 02:15:21,060
how could you have thought they had a finite reality?

2602
02:15:21,060 --> 02:15:23,700
The illusory being is a kind of being.

2603
02:15:23,700 --> 02:15:27,660
So they can't not exist at all.

2604
02:15:27,660 --> 02:15:31,820
And furthermore, he thinks that the pressure to a cosmism

2605
02:15:31,820 --> 02:15:33,980
is endemic or internal, more or less,

2606
02:15:33,980 --> 02:15:35,820
to the entire Western philosophical tradition.

2607
02:15:35,820 --> 02:15:37,900
In fact, Western philosophy begins with a cosmism.

2608
02:15:37,900 --> 02:15:40,980
It begins with Parnedians.

2609
02:15:40,980 --> 02:15:44,900
And it returns in the form of Spinoza,

2610
02:15:45,540 --> 02:15:47,780
he thinks Spinoza, although he Spinoza denies it,

2611
02:15:47,780 --> 02:15:51,460
Spinoza's view entails that no finite things exist.

2612
02:15:51,460 --> 02:15:54,060
In fact, not just no finite things, no beings exist.

2613
02:15:54,060 --> 02:15:55,100
God is not a being.

2614
02:15:55,100 --> 02:15:56,260
God is just pure being.

2615
02:15:56,260 --> 02:15:57,700
That's what Hegel thinks Western is.

2616
02:15:57,700 --> 02:16:00,580
He's also read it.

2617
02:16:00,580 --> 02:16:03,460
And he thinks that his entire philosophical tradition,

2618
02:16:03,460 --> 02:16:06,060
fifth de Chale, all of his pals, also

2619
02:16:06,060 --> 02:16:10,820
have this problem that their fundamental first principle,

2620
02:16:10,820 --> 02:16:14,180
the I or the indifference point, actually

2621
02:16:14,180 --> 02:16:17,180
eliminates the existence of all finite things.

2622
02:16:17,180 --> 02:16:18,540
It eliminates all beings.

2623
02:16:18,540 --> 02:16:20,580
It's just pure being.

2624
02:16:20,580 --> 02:16:22,860
So what we have to do is maintain

2625
02:16:22,860 --> 02:16:25,660
the existence of finite things, but not in this dumb way

2626
02:16:25,660 --> 02:16:27,740
that sexual certainty wants to.

2627
02:16:27,740 --> 02:16:29,980
Here's a being, here's another being,

2628
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:32,940
and they're unrelated to one another.

2629
02:16:32,940 --> 02:16:34,980
In fact, the way we have to retain

2630
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:38,300
the being of finite things is the way the animals do,

2631
02:16:38,300 --> 02:16:41,620
which is to say, they have a, finite things

2632
02:16:41,620 --> 02:16:47,820
have a kind of being, which is then subrelated,

2633
02:16:47,820 --> 02:16:50,500
but then retained at a higher level.

2634
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:53,020
So we'll talk about this in the logic,

2635
02:16:53,020 --> 02:16:57,340
but the digestive model of the animal's relationship

2636
02:16:57,340 --> 02:16:59,580
to finite things is, in fact, Hegel's

2637
02:16:59,580 --> 02:17:01,500
view about the reality of finite things.

2638
02:17:01,500 --> 02:17:03,500
So what he's saying is, you need to go

2639
02:17:03,500 --> 02:17:05,420
to the L.O. studio of mysteries, or more properly,

2640
02:17:05,420 --> 02:17:07,060
just to pay attention to animals.

2641
02:17:07,060 --> 02:17:11,060
And what you'll see is, finite things do have a kind of being.

2642
02:17:11,940 --> 02:17:12,780
Then we'll read some more.

2643
02:17:12,780 --> 02:17:14,940
Actually, in the back, we have not heard from you.

2644
02:17:14,940 --> 02:17:16,540
Yeah, sorry.

2645
02:17:16,540 --> 02:17:20,860
So then, where does, I guess, Hegel's one time student,

2646
02:17:20,860 --> 02:17:22,420
Sterner fall out?

2647
02:17:22,420 --> 02:17:23,860
I have no idea.

2648
02:17:23,860 --> 02:17:26,660
I've never read any Sterner, because it just

2649
02:17:26,660 --> 02:17:29,460
sounds so insane.

2650
02:17:29,460 --> 02:17:32,220
Generally, so after Hegel's death,

2651
02:17:32,220 --> 02:17:36,420
or even during Hegel's life, people

2652
02:17:36,420 --> 02:17:38,980
divide in their reactions to Hegel

2653
02:17:38,980 --> 02:17:41,700
between so-called left Hegelians, who

2654
02:17:41,700 --> 02:17:44,660
think that the true philosophical message of Hegel

2655
02:17:44,660 --> 02:17:48,260
is revolutionary with respect to traditional religion

2656
02:17:48,260 --> 02:17:49,780
in the Prussian state.

2657
02:17:49,780 --> 02:17:53,780
Right Hegelians, who think Hegel is a defender

2658
02:17:53,780 --> 02:17:56,940
of orthodox Lutheranism, and the Prussian monarchy,

2659
02:17:56,940 --> 02:17:58,660
and the true view.

2660
02:17:58,660 --> 02:18:03,100
Central Hegelianism, Hegel was a central Hegelian, namely

2661
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:08,340
that the true religious concept of Hegel

2662
02:18:08,340 --> 02:18:12,700
is not very much like orthodox Lutheranism,

2663
02:18:12,700 --> 02:18:15,460
but nor is it any kind of atheism,

2664
02:18:15,460 --> 02:18:17,140
or this Freudian nonsense about how

2665
02:18:17,140 --> 02:18:19,380
God is the projection of our inferiority complex,

2666
02:18:19,380 --> 02:18:21,820
or whatever.

2667
02:18:21,820 --> 02:18:24,460
And the political content of Hegelian philosophy

2668
02:18:24,460 --> 02:18:26,980
is a constitutional reform of the Prussian monarchy,

2669
02:18:26,980 --> 02:18:29,900
rather than it's in its absolutist form.

2670
02:18:29,900 --> 02:18:32,180
But I have not gotten into this.

2671
02:18:32,180 --> 02:18:34,220
Sterner is one of the big left Hegelians,

2672
02:18:34,220 --> 02:18:36,220
but I have, to a large extent, not really gotten

2673
02:18:36,220 --> 02:18:37,300
to the left Hegelianism, because they

2674
02:18:37,340 --> 02:18:40,140
don't feel like I understand Hegel well enough to get

2675
02:18:40,140 --> 02:18:42,380
into the left, right, and center Hegelianism.

2676
02:18:42,380 --> 02:18:45,180
OK, but before we finish today, I

2677
02:18:45,180 --> 02:18:49,860
want to talk about the end of 110, or actually 110.

2678
02:18:49,860 --> 02:18:52,900
However, those who set up such assertions in lines

2679
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:54,980
with the previous remarks also immediately

2680
02:18:54,980 --> 02:18:56,860
say the opposite of what they mean,

2681
02:18:56,860 --> 02:18:58,660
a phenomenon that is perhaps best

2682
02:18:58,660 --> 02:19:00,340
able to bring them to reflect on the nature

2683
02:19:00,340 --> 02:19:01,740
of the century with certainty.

2684
02:19:01,740 --> 02:19:03,980
They speak of the existence of external objects,

2685
02:19:03,980 --> 02:19:05,660
which, to put it more precisely, can

2686
02:19:05,660 --> 02:19:07,860
be turned into the actual, absolutely singular,

2687
02:19:07,860 --> 02:19:11,140
individual, wholly personal, individual things, each of which

2688
02:19:11,140 --> 02:19:13,020
is absolutely unlike the others.

2689
02:19:13,020 --> 02:19:16,140
This existence is said to have absolute certainty and truth.

2690
02:19:16,140 --> 02:19:18,820
They mean this piece of paper on which I am writing,

2691
02:19:18,820 --> 02:19:20,620
or rather have written this.

2692
02:19:20,620 --> 02:19:22,900
But they do not say what they mean.

2693
02:19:22,900 --> 02:19:26,540
They intend to talk about concrete, sensible particulars,

2694
02:19:26,540 --> 02:19:28,740
but what they really say is universals.

2695
02:19:28,740 --> 02:19:31,020
However much they actually wanted to say what they

2696
02:19:31,020 --> 02:19:33,540
knew about this piece of paper, and however much they wanted

2697
02:19:33,540 --> 02:19:35,940
to say it, still it would be impossible

2698
02:19:35,940 --> 02:19:39,260
because the sensuous this, which is what is meant,

2699
02:19:39,260 --> 02:19:43,100
is inaccessible to the language which belongs to consciousness,

2700
02:19:43,100 --> 02:19:45,540
or to what is in itself universal.

2701
02:19:45,540 --> 02:19:48,420
In the actual attempt to say it, in itself

2702
02:19:48,420 --> 02:19:50,500
would therefore rot away.

2703
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:55,540
So the singular, an individual, is inaccessible to the language

2704
02:19:55,540 --> 02:20:00,620
of consciousness because, to refer to this,

2705
02:20:00,620 --> 02:20:04,500
you need not just a universal, nor do you

2706
02:20:04,500 --> 02:20:07,660
need just a singular indexical like this.

2707
02:20:07,660 --> 02:20:09,420
You need both.

2708
02:20:09,420 --> 02:20:12,420
You need to refer to this pencil.

2709
02:20:12,420 --> 02:20:15,380
You need to have a conception of the object

2710
02:20:15,380 --> 02:20:19,020
as an instance of a universal.

2711
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:22,020
So the idea is, if you just have this,

2712
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:25,180
there's no account of why you're referring to the pencil

2713
02:20:25,180 --> 02:20:28,820
rather than the parts of the pencil, the eraser, the tip.

2714
02:20:28,820 --> 02:20:33,020
The only way objects can be available for consciousness

2715
02:20:33,020 --> 02:20:38,380
is if they are this such, an instance of a universal.

2716
02:20:38,380 --> 02:20:42,340
Skipping a bit, if nothing is more said of a thing,

2717
02:20:42,340 --> 02:20:45,820
that it is an actual thing, an external object,

2718
02:20:45,820 --> 02:20:49,500
that it is only expressed as the most universal of all.

2719
02:20:49,500 --> 02:20:53,620
And what is therefore expressed is the sameness with everything

2720
02:20:53,620 --> 02:20:55,700
rather than its distinctiveness.

2721
02:20:55,700 --> 02:20:58,700
If I say a singular thing, then instead I

2722
02:20:58,700 --> 02:21:01,260
say something entirely universal about it,

2723
02:21:01,260 --> 02:21:03,540
for everything is a singular thing.

2724
02:21:03,540 --> 02:21:06,700
Likewise, this thing is anything one pleases.

2725
02:21:06,700 --> 02:21:10,460
To characterize it more precisely as this piece of paper,

2726
02:21:10,460 --> 02:21:13,980
every and each bit of paper is a this, a piece of paper,

2727
02:21:13,980 --> 02:21:18,220
and I've only spoken, as usual, of the universal.

2728
02:21:18,220 --> 02:21:20,720
That is to say, I need not just a universal, but something

2729
02:21:20,720 --> 02:21:22,500
like a Kantian intuition.

2730
02:21:22,500 --> 02:21:25,100
However, if I wish to lend a helping hand to speech,

2731
02:21:25,100 --> 02:21:27,780
which itself has the defined nature of immediately inverting

2732
02:21:27,780 --> 02:21:30,540
the meaning, that of making it to something else,

2733
02:21:30,540 --> 02:21:32,700
and in that way of not letting the meaning get

2734
02:21:32,700 --> 02:21:34,220
into words at all.

2735
02:21:34,220 --> 02:21:37,020
So this is what Hegel loves these plays on language,

2736
02:21:37,020 --> 02:21:39,420
because he thinks what language shows

2737
02:21:39,420 --> 02:21:42,620
is this distinction between what consciousness means to say

2738
02:21:42,620 --> 02:21:45,140
and what it says.

2739
02:21:45,140 --> 02:21:47,140
Then by pointing out this piece of paper,

2740
02:21:47,140 --> 02:21:49,660
I thus learn from experience what the truth of sensuous

2741
02:21:49,660 --> 02:21:51,340
certainty, in fact, is.

2742
02:21:51,340 --> 02:21:53,500
I point it out as a hearer, which

2743
02:21:53,500 --> 02:21:56,460
is a hearer of other hearers, for which in its own self

2744
02:21:56,460 --> 02:21:59,700
is a simple ensemble of many hearers, which is to say,

2745
02:21:59,700 --> 02:22:01,140
is a universal.

2746
02:22:01,140 --> 02:22:04,060
In that way, I receive it as it is in truth,

2747
02:22:04,060 --> 02:22:07,300
and instead of noting what is immediate, I perceive.

2748
02:22:07,300 --> 02:22:09,740
So now what Hegel is doing is transitioning

2749
02:22:09,740 --> 02:22:13,820
to the transition from the first object to the second.

2750
02:22:13,820 --> 02:22:16,260
So that is to say, from the first form of consciousness

2751
02:22:16,260 --> 02:22:18,340
to the second form of consciousness.

2752
02:22:18,340 --> 02:22:21,100
The second form of consciousness is the determinant negation

2753
02:22:21,180 --> 02:22:24,020
of the first form of consciousness.

2754
02:22:24,020 --> 02:22:25,300
We don't have a new beginning.

2755
02:22:25,300 --> 02:22:26,580
We don't start from nothing.

2756
02:22:26,580 --> 02:22:28,500
Nor is the second shape of consciousness just,

2757
02:22:28,500 --> 02:22:30,220
you don't know it.

2758
02:22:30,220 --> 02:22:33,780
The second object is the being of the first object

2759
02:22:33,780 --> 02:22:35,180
for consciousness.

2760
02:22:35,180 --> 02:22:38,460
So insofar as the first object knew something,

2761
02:22:38,460 --> 02:22:40,820
the second object is what it knew.

2762
02:22:40,820 --> 02:22:45,460
So insofar as the first shape of consciousness knew something

2763
02:22:45,460 --> 02:22:49,820
or intended to know something, it was this.

2764
02:22:49,820 --> 02:22:52,500
But the reason it couldn't know this

2765
02:22:52,500 --> 02:22:56,020
is because it didn't put any universals in the shape,

2766
02:22:56,020 --> 02:22:58,700
in the object of its knowledge.

2767
02:22:58,700 --> 02:23:02,700
So the resolution of that problem

2768
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:06,340
is to recognize that the object of knowledge

2769
02:23:06,340 --> 02:23:10,100
is a thing that instantiates universals,

2770
02:23:10,100 --> 02:23:13,940
a thing with properties, of this such.

2771
02:23:13,940 --> 02:23:17,900
Because once we have that, we have both of this,

2772
02:23:17,900 --> 02:23:21,380
which is something like a spatio-temporal indexical.

2773
02:23:21,380 --> 02:23:24,180
It indicates a direction in your environment.

2774
02:23:24,180 --> 02:23:26,940
But then with the concept, it picks out

2775
02:23:26,940 --> 02:23:29,940
in the fortunate case which thing in your environment

2776
02:23:29,940 --> 02:23:31,460
you're referring to.

2777
02:23:31,460 --> 02:23:37,300
If I say, this book, I'm screwed.

2778
02:23:37,300 --> 02:23:40,740
If I say, this iPhone, now I'm good to go.

2779
02:23:40,740 --> 02:23:42,780
And the reason that worked is because I

2780
02:23:42,780 --> 02:23:45,100
didn't say the iPhone or iPhones.

2781
02:23:45,100 --> 02:23:47,380
That will refer to all iPhones whatsoever.

2782
02:23:47,460 --> 02:23:50,620
Nor did I say this, because this doesn't determinately

2783
02:23:50,620 --> 02:23:51,780
refer to anything.

2784
02:23:51,780 --> 02:23:53,380
I said, this iPhone.

2785
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:57,460
And that only picks out this if this is an iPhone,

2786
02:23:57,460 --> 02:23:59,380
and not everything else is an iPhone, which

2787
02:23:59,380 --> 02:24:01,700
means this has to have a universal,

2788
02:24:01,700 --> 02:24:03,340
has to be an instance of something,

2789
02:24:03,340 --> 02:24:06,860
and it has to be a universal that other things don't have,

2790
02:24:06,860 --> 02:24:08,940
not everything else has.

2791
02:24:08,940 --> 02:24:11,260
Otherwise, it wouldn't pick it up.

2792
02:24:11,260 --> 02:24:12,260
Yeah?

2793
02:24:12,460 --> 02:24:16,900
For instance, expressing it as an actual thing

2794
02:24:16,900 --> 02:24:20,900
and its sameness with everything else,

2795
02:24:20,900 --> 02:24:22,900
does this, when you speak to the students,

2796
02:24:22,900 --> 02:24:24,660
be that Schelling position that you

2797
02:24:24,660 --> 02:24:26,900
emphasize in the practice of managing the 12,000

2798
02:24:26,900 --> 02:24:29,700
by a computer-socially-centered student?

2799
02:24:29,700 --> 02:24:30,300
Yes.

2800
02:24:30,300 --> 02:24:34,060
In an other way, if we want to bring Schelling into that,

2801
02:24:34,060 --> 02:24:43,740
what he's saying is what sensuous certainty means

2802
02:24:43,740 --> 02:24:46,300
to know, what it intends to know,

2803
02:24:46,300 --> 02:24:48,260
is concrete particulars.

2804
02:24:48,260 --> 02:24:50,620
What it actually says it knows is

2805
02:24:50,620 --> 02:24:53,860
something as indeterminate as Schelling's note in which

2806
02:24:53,860 --> 02:24:55,980
all cows are alive.

2807
02:24:55,980 --> 02:24:57,460
Pure be.

2808
02:24:57,460 --> 02:25:05,060
Now, that brings in Schelling, but many of you

2809
02:25:05,060 --> 02:25:06,420
don't know who Schelling is.

2810
02:25:06,420 --> 02:25:07,380
Don't worry about it.

2811
02:25:07,380 --> 02:25:13,540
But the first principle of Schelling's philosophy,

2812
02:25:13,540 --> 02:25:16,780
Hegel thinks is, actually Schelling explicitly says this,

2813
02:25:16,780 --> 02:25:20,460
is as indeterminate as purity.

2814
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:22,900
That's to say, it has no differences or determinacies

2815
02:25:22,900 --> 02:25:24,100
in it whatsoever.

2816
02:25:24,100 --> 02:25:26,980
It's completely a cosmos starting point.

2817
02:25:27,020 --> 02:25:32,420
So what Hegel is saying is that sensuous certainty thinks

2818
02:25:32,420 --> 02:25:34,740
it's the most concrete empiricist position

2819
02:25:34,740 --> 02:25:35,620
possible.

2820
02:25:35,620 --> 02:25:38,900
But what it's actually saying is that what it's conscious of

2821
02:25:38,900 --> 02:25:41,820
is the most insane Schellingian totally

2822
02:25:41,820 --> 02:25:46,460
indifferent starting point of all philosophy.

2823
02:25:46,460 --> 02:25:50,060
So that means that the second shape of consciousness

2824
02:25:50,060 --> 02:25:56,280
is one in which objects are instances of universals, things

2825
02:25:56,280 --> 02:25:58,520
with problems.

2826
02:25:58,520 --> 02:26:01,040
Now, I just want to note that if we

2827
02:26:01,040 --> 02:26:06,320
look at the table of contents of the phenomenology of spirit,

2828
02:26:06,320 --> 02:26:09,720
I think this edition has a relatively informative one.

2829
02:26:12,720 --> 02:26:17,000
We'll just note that the first form of consciousness

2830
02:26:17,000 --> 02:26:18,800
is sensuous certainty.

2831
02:26:18,800 --> 02:26:21,960
The second shape of consciousness is perceiving.

2832
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:23,880
And the third shape of consciousness

2833
02:26:23,880 --> 02:26:26,880
is force and the understanding, appearance,

2834
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:29,000
and the super sensible world.

2835
02:26:29,000 --> 02:26:31,920
So if we think of this in Kantian terms,

2836
02:26:31,920 --> 02:26:33,760
and then the second one is self-consciousness,

2837
02:26:33,760 --> 02:26:37,320
we're in a certain way building up

2838
02:26:37,320 --> 02:26:39,440
the capacities of the Kantian mind.

2839
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:44,360
There's appearance, perception, and then understanding.

2840
02:26:44,360 --> 02:26:46,680
Where understanding involves making a distinction

2841
02:26:46,680 --> 02:26:52,920
between how things appear to you and the super sensible objects

2842
02:26:52,920 --> 02:26:54,440
that are appearing to you.

2843
02:26:54,440 --> 02:26:58,320
And then there's aperceptive self-consciousness.

2844
02:26:58,320 --> 02:27:00,400
Now, that doesn't mean that this is supposed

2845
02:27:00,400 --> 02:27:04,160
to correspond one-to-one with Kant's taxonomy

2846
02:27:04,160 --> 02:27:09,200
of the human mind because Hegel thinks of Kant

2847
02:27:09,200 --> 02:27:10,880
as he thinks of every other philosopher

2848
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:12,920
as insufficiently systematic.

2849
02:27:12,920 --> 02:27:15,880
That's to say, we don't want a one-to-one correspondence

2850
02:27:15,880 --> 02:27:18,640
with Kant's quote unquote system because Kant's system isn't

2851
02:27:18,640 --> 02:27:20,280
really systematic.

2852
02:27:20,360 --> 02:27:23,480
This is the systematic articulation

2853
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:26,000
of everything that has to be in spirit in order

2854
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:28,320
for spirit to be spirit.

2855
02:27:28,320 --> 02:27:31,360
But even properly, it maybe isn't that

2856
02:27:31,360 --> 02:27:34,800
because it's doing that by way of uncovering

2857
02:27:34,800 --> 02:27:37,480
the internal dialectical failures of all

2858
02:27:37,480 --> 02:27:42,400
of these other conceptions of what now it is.

2859
02:27:42,400 --> 02:27:42,880
Yeah.

2860
02:27:42,880 --> 02:27:44,000
Yeah.

2861
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:47,080
I have a question similar to Kantian's one.

2862
02:27:47,080 --> 02:27:48,760
And it's just about concepts.

2863
02:27:48,840 --> 02:27:52,240
I feel like in the Cartesian sense,

2864
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:54,560
the thoughts in itself themselves

2865
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:57,360
are kind of immediate to us.

2866
02:27:57,360 --> 02:28:01,840
And then with perceptual input, we see new things.

2867
02:28:01,840 --> 02:28:05,560
And we maybe we can modify all those concepts and so on.

2868
02:28:05,560 --> 02:28:07,520
It's like backwards.

2869
02:28:07,520 --> 02:28:12,960
So that is a remark in a different way

2870
02:28:12,960 --> 02:28:16,720
of doing philosophy, a way of doing philosophy in which we

2871
02:28:16,720 --> 02:28:20,120
start with what seems plausible to us,

2872
02:28:20,120 --> 02:28:22,520
and then we reason from there.

2873
02:28:22,520 --> 02:28:24,000
That's not what Hegel is doing.

2874
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,320
That's not how the phenomenology works.

2875
02:28:26,320 --> 02:28:30,160
The phenomenology does not work with any.

2876
02:28:30,160 --> 02:28:33,480
Our assumptions are supposed to be completely suspended.

2877
02:28:33,480 --> 02:28:36,760
And it's supposed to unfold from the most immediate,

2878
02:28:36,760 --> 02:28:40,120
that is to say, indeterminate shape of knowledge possible,

2879
02:28:40,120 --> 02:28:42,080
everything that knowledge is.

2880
02:28:42,080 --> 02:28:45,040
So what seems to us plausible isn't,

2881
02:28:45,040 --> 02:28:47,520
so to speak, argumentatively relevant.

2882
02:28:47,520 --> 02:28:54,160
And so likewise, what's phenomenologically available

2883
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:58,000
to us in Dufcerlian sense also isn't relevant,

2884
02:28:58,000 --> 02:29:04,600
because that would assume a different conception

2885
02:29:04,600 --> 02:29:06,520
of what knowledge is, which hasn't been dialectically

2886
02:29:06,520 --> 02:29:09,440
unfolded yet in phenomenology.

2887
02:29:09,440 --> 02:29:10,720
Yeah.

2888
02:29:10,720 --> 02:29:12,600
In the previous lecture, you said

2889
02:29:12,600 --> 02:29:15,040
that each shape of consciousness

2890
02:29:15,040 --> 02:29:19,200
has to determine the next shape of consciousness.

2891
02:29:19,200 --> 02:29:22,080
It seems like pure consciousness has options

2892
02:29:22,080 --> 02:29:25,840
between sticking to its original claim.

2893
02:29:25,840 --> 02:29:27,720
I know particulars.

2894
02:29:27,720 --> 02:29:30,880
Or just going into pure being.

2895
02:29:30,880 --> 02:29:32,840
How about an issue?

2896
02:29:32,840 --> 02:29:34,200
It is an issue.

2897
02:29:34,200 --> 02:29:36,400
The systematic structure of phenomenology

2898
02:29:36,400 --> 02:29:40,520
requires that there be one and only one successor

2899
02:29:40,520 --> 02:29:41,800
shape of consciousness.

2900
02:29:41,800 --> 02:29:45,800
If there's forking paths, then the argument is real.

2901
02:29:45,800 --> 02:29:50,360
So if we really want to take phenomenology seriously,

2902
02:29:50,360 --> 02:29:52,400
we have to ask ourselves at every step,

2903
02:29:52,400 --> 02:29:55,040
is there a potential forking path here?

2904
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:59,720
And the move towards pure being is one such forking path.

2905
02:29:59,720 --> 02:30:02,640
Now, I think Hegel thinks he has a number of reasons

2906
02:30:02,640 --> 02:30:06,760
to foreclose sensuous certainty of pure being

2907
02:30:06,760 --> 02:30:09,480
as a possibility, one of which will be relevant when we talk

2908
02:30:09,480 --> 02:30:11,240
about pure being and logic, is I think

2909
02:30:11,240 --> 02:30:15,680
he thinks pure being is not a possible object of knowledge

2910
02:30:15,680 --> 02:30:17,440
because it's so indeterminate.

2911
02:30:17,440 --> 02:30:20,000
You can't know pure being.

2912
02:30:20,000 --> 02:30:22,120
What would you know?

2913
02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:24,680
What did you learn at school today, pure being?

2914
02:30:24,680 --> 02:30:25,680
Oh, tell me about that.

2915
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:27,880
It is.

2916
02:30:27,880 --> 02:30:30,480
It is just purely.

2917
02:30:30,480 --> 02:30:31,840
Is there any particular way?

2918
02:30:31,840 --> 02:30:32,560
Oh, no, no, no.

2919
02:30:32,560 --> 02:30:33,680
It's not any particular way.

2920
02:30:33,680 --> 02:30:34,160
It just did.

2921
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:38,400
Yes, fine.

2922
02:30:38,400 --> 02:30:40,120
Each of the arguments Hegel makes,

2923
02:30:40,440 --> 02:30:42,520
are those supposedly the only arguments that

2924
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:44,920
can be made to move from one argument to the next?

2925
02:30:47,840 --> 02:30:48,920
Good question.

2926
02:30:48,920 --> 02:30:51,240
I don't think Hegel wants to like,

2927
02:30:51,240 --> 02:30:54,080
we don't want to read Hegel as having some like,

2928
02:30:54,080 --> 02:30:57,960
implausible view or like, these words in exactly this order

2929
02:30:57,960 --> 02:30:59,080
have to be written this way.

2930
02:30:59,080 --> 02:31:03,400
So like, there has to be some flexibility or plasticity

2931
02:31:03,400 --> 02:31:05,280
in the order of presentation.

2932
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:08,240
Like, did he have to do this whole thing of doing,

2933
02:31:09,200 --> 02:31:12,800
now is night, and here's the tree, here's the house.

2934
02:31:12,800 --> 02:31:14,160
I see the tree.

2935
02:31:14,160 --> 02:31:16,160
I see the house as someone else.

2936
02:31:16,160 --> 02:31:17,880
Couldn't he have just skipped immediately

2937
02:31:17,880 --> 02:31:20,160
to the form of sensuous certainty

2938
02:31:20,160 --> 02:31:22,840
in which there's no essential difference,

2939
02:31:22,840 --> 02:31:25,120
no difference in essence between subject and object?

2940
02:31:25,120 --> 02:31:26,680
Probably.

2941
02:31:26,680 --> 02:31:31,240
But the problems arise from the shape of consciousness itself,

2942
02:31:31,240 --> 02:31:35,040
and therefore, they cannot be Hegel's invention.

2943
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:37,320
So I'll just warn, I mean, one of the reasons

2944
02:31:37,320 --> 02:31:39,120
I don't love teaching the phenomenology of spirit

2945
02:31:39,120 --> 02:31:40,120
as the whole book, I actually love

2946
02:31:40,120 --> 02:31:43,280
teaching sensuous certainty because people get the point.

2947
02:31:43,280 --> 02:31:47,200
And you can actually kind of philosophically engage with it,

2948
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:48,440
pretty straightforwardly.

2949
02:31:48,440 --> 02:31:51,160
One of the reasons I don't love teaching the whole book is,

2950
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:54,560
the further you go in the book, the harder it is to believe

2951
02:31:54,560 --> 02:31:56,840
all of the transitions are principled.

2952
02:31:56,840 --> 02:32:00,600
So famously, as a friend of mine, I put it this way,

2953
02:32:00,600 --> 02:32:02,880
it's more or less impossible to predict

2954
02:32:02,880 --> 02:32:05,200
what the next shape of consciousness is going to be,

2955
02:32:05,240 --> 02:32:07,800
which is a sign that there is not, in fact,

2956
02:32:07,800 --> 02:32:10,640
a principal function that takes you from shape of consciousness

2957
02:32:10,640 --> 02:32:13,280
n to n plus 1, because then we would just learn the function.

2958
02:32:13,280 --> 02:32:14,800
Every time I read the phenomenology,

2959
02:32:14,800 --> 02:32:16,840
I'm a little surprised by what comes next.

2960
02:32:16,840 --> 02:32:18,120
I'm like, really?

2961
02:32:18,120 --> 02:32:19,400
Why that?

2962
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:24,240
Likewise, it's hard by the end of the book

2963
02:32:24,240 --> 02:32:30,800
to feel like all of these problems are purely interned.

2964
02:32:30,800 --> 02:32:32,560
My general sense is, I kind of feel

2965
02:32:32,560 --> 02:32:35,400
like I have a line on what's going on everything up

2966
02:32:35,400 --> 02:32:36,440
through reason.

2967
02:32:36,440 --> 02:32:38,520
And then the transition, once we transition

2968
02:32:38,520 --> 02:32:40,800
to spirit in the middle of the book,

2969
02:32:40,800 --> 02:32:44,120
the feeling of arbitrariness in the successor

2970
02:32:44,120 --> 02:32:47,480
shapes of consciousness and the problems that arise

2971
02:32:47,480 --> 02:32:50,920
starts to just kind of grow exponentially.

2972
02:32:50,920 --> 02:32:54,840
So after we get to reason, we get to spirit.

2973
02:32:54,840 --> 02:32:58,000
And the first shape of spirit is this shape of spirit

2974
02:32:58,000 --> 02:33:07,160
in which somehow your family is in touch

2975
02:33:07,160 --> 02:33:11,440
with the gods of the underworld.

2976
02:33:11,440 --> 02:33:13,520
But then in your public life, you're

2977
02:33:13,520 --> 02:33:18,360
like a good patriotic Greek citizen.

2978
02:33:18,360 --> 02:33:21,440
So it's just like, what?

2979
02:33:21,440 --> 02:33:23,240
Why are we talking about antigone?

2980
02:33:23,240 --> 02:33:26,680
It's just very hard for me to really be convinced

2981
02:33:26,680 --> 02:33:28,840
about every transition.

2982
02:33:28,840 --> 02:33:31,680
I'm not a super phenomenology optimist.

2983
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:33,800
Just to make sure I got this, however,

2984
02:33:33,800 --> 02:33:38,280
the paradox of sense certainty is not

2985
02:33:38,280 --> 02:33:41,440
being able to say what it means or the contradiction to what

2986
02:33:41,440 --> 02:33:44,920
it means when it says, are the rocks on which sense certainty

2987
02:33:44,920 --> 02:33:50,080
as a shape of knowing, for example.

2988
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:53,280
And that's what causes the despair, is it,

2989
02:33:53,280 --> 02:33:56,040
that lifts us up to the next?

2990
02:33:56,040 --> 02:33:56,540
Exactly.

2991
02:33:56,540 --> 02:33:58,280
Up to the next state.

2992
02:33:58,280 --> 02:34:04,320
And that's an example of an internal self-contradiction.

2993
02:34:04,320 --> 02:34:06,800
Or imminent, yeah.

2994
02:34:06,800 --> 02:34:11,800
Could not the advocate of sense certainty

2995
02:34:11,800 --> 02:34:17,480
say that contradiction is not part of its bag

2996
02:34:17,480 --> 02:34:20,040
and that therefore what's being advanced against it

2997
02:34:20,040 --> 02:34:21,800
is actually an external criteria?

2998
02:34:21,800 --> 02:34:22,680
Good.

2999
02:34:22,680 --> 02:34:25,440
Gets to a fundamental issue in Hegel's philosophy.

3000
02:34:25,520 --> 02:34:29,160
Why do we have to care about contradictions?

3001
02:34:29,160 --> 02:34:33,720
Foundational, if we just read the way the book works,

3002
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:40,280
it seems absolutely foundational that contradictions are death.

3003
02:34:40,280 --> 02:34:42,400
That means you get a contradiction,

3004
02:34:42,400 --> 02:34:44,000
you have to overcome it.

3005
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:48,840
Sense to a certainty cannot just rest content.

3006
02:34:48,840 --> 02:34:51,440
Just be like, yep, I know this object.

3007
02:34:51,440 --> 02:34:53,280
That object is not knowable.

3008
02:34:53,280 --> 02:34:55,040
What's the problem?

3009
02:34:55,840 --> 02:35:00,560
Now, this will be more relevant in the science of logic.

3010
02:35:00,560 --> 02:35:03,920
But Hegel's, both the phenomenology and the science

3011
02:35:03,920 --> 02:35:06,640
of logic, mostly explicitly, I kind of think actually

3012
02:35:06,640 --> 02:35:08,440
the entire encyclopedia, the entire system,

3013
02:35:08,440 --> 02:35:13,040
depends on uncovering and reconciling contradictions.

3014
02:35:13,040 --> 02:35:15,840
Now, that's true, as you just brought out,

3015
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:18,520
from the word one of the phenomenology.

3016
02:35:18,520 --> 02:35:22,440
It will also be true from word one of the science of logic.

3017
02:35:22,440 --> 02:35:25,760
Now, no justification is given to us.

3018
02:35:25,760 --> 02:35:28,960
So that means it's internal, it's foundational for Hegel,

3019
02:35:28,960 --> 02:35:31,600
that you cannot just rest content with a contradiction.

3020
02:35:31,600 --> 02:35:34,120
You have to move beyond.

3021
02:35:34,120 --> 02:35:38,520
Now, that means that a certain kind of attitude

3022
02:35:38,520 --> 02:35:40,680
towards the principle of contradiction

3023
02:35:40,680 --> 02:35:44,600
is built into the way the whole philosophical system works.

3024
02:35:44,600 --> 02:35:47,400
One view about contradictions is that contradictions cannot even

3025
02:35:47,400 --> 02:35:49,720
be thought.

3026
02:35:49,720 --> 02:35:53,480
You can say P and not P, but you haven't thought anything.

3027
02:35:53,480 --> 02:35:57,320
Kant can be read as saying that.

3028
02:35:57,320 --> 02:36:00,560
Another view is that you just shouldn't

3029
02:36:00,560 --> 02:36:03,000
believe contradictions, you shouldn't think of them.

3030
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:05,320
You can, but you shouldn't give them.

3031
02:36:05,320 --> 02:36:07,680
Kant can also be read that way.

3032
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:11,720
The problem with the don't do it is, OK,

3033
02:36:11,720 --> 02:36:14,360
I do a lot of things I shouldn't do.

3034
02:36:14,360 --> 02:36:17,600
What's so bad about contradicting myself?

3035
02:36:17,600 --> 02:36:19,320
What I say won't be true, but I also

3036
02:36:19,320 --> 02:36:22,560
say a lot of things aren't true.

3037
02:36:22,560 --> 02:36:25,840
The problem with that you can't think it is, well,

3038
02:36:25,840 --> 02:36:28,520
it does seem like we think contradictions all the time.

3039
02:36:28,520 --> 02:36:30,400
You can reason with them.

3040
02:36:30,400 --> 02:36:34,520
So now Hegel definitely is not a you cannot think a contradiction

3041
02:36:34,520 --> 02:36:38,560
person, because the logic is just full of contradictions.

3042
02:36:38,560 --> 02:36:40,480
And it's all thinking.

3043
02:36:40,480 --> 02:36:45,080
But nor is he merely a don't do it, because that's too weak.

3044
02:36:45,080 --> 02:36:50,200
And the logic is not built on, oh, you should keep doing this.

3045
02:36:50,200 --> 02:36:53,800
The forward movement of the phenomenology and the logic

3046
02:36:53,800 --> 02:36:55,600
are not a normative one.

3047
02:36:55,600 --> 02:36:59,760
You're a bad person if you don't keep reading.

3048
02:36:59,760 --> 02:37:03,720
So he seems to have a third view, which is contradictions

3049
02:37:03,720 --> 02:37:10,480
are thinkable, but thought as such must strive to resolve.

3050
02:37:10,480 --> 02:37:13,640
It cannot rest content with a contradiction.

3051
02:37:13,640 --> 02:37:17,640
It has to try to go beyond the contradiction.

3052
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:21,600
And the reason this is relevant is because there

3053
02:37:21,600 --> 02:37:25,480
are people who read, so we'll talk about this when we get

3054
02:37:25,480 --> 02:37:27,600
to the logic, there are people who

3055
02:37:27,600 --> 02:37:29,560
think there are true contradictions.

3056
02:37:29,560 --> 02:37:32,200
They're called dialytheists, because they

3057
02:37:32,200 --> 02:37:39,080
think something can be both true and false.

3058
02:37:39,600 --> 02:37:43,920
That can be true, that p is both true and false.

3059
02:37:43,920 --> 02:37:47,840
And Hegel is one of their main historical supports.

3060
02:37:47,840 --> 02:37:50,600
You can read Hegel as a dialytheist,

3061
02:37:50,600 --> 02:37:54,360
because he says dialytheist friendly things all the time.

3062
02:37:54,360 --> 02:37:58,160
The problem is if Hegel thinks that contradictions are true,

3063
02:37:58,160 --> 02:38:02,160
when we get to contradictions, why do we have to move beyond them?

3064
02:38:02,160 --> 02:38:04,560
The problem with the dialytheist is

3065
02:38:04,560 --> 02:38:08,200
they don't have a sufficient, for Hegel,

3066
02:38:08,200 --> 02:38:10,360
a sufficiently strong justification of why we,

3067
02:38:10,360 --> 02:38:12,560
when we get to a contradiction, we don't just go, oh,

3068
02:38:12,560 --> 02:38:14,800
interesting fact, contradiction.

3069
02:38:14,800 --> 02:38:18,480
What they will say is you want to minimize contradictions,

3070
02:38:18,480 --> 02:38:21,480
because the more contradictions you have,

3071
02:38:21,480 --> 02:38:23,280
the more messed up your logic is.

3072
02:38:23,280 --> 02:38:25,640
So the basic idea of dialytheist logic

3073
02:38:25,640 --> 02:38:28,440
is you can have a non-trivial logic that

3074
02:38:28,440 --> 02:38:29,840
has true contradictions in it.

3075
02:38:29,840 --> 02:38:31,440
You just have various logical methods

3076
02:38:31,440 --> 02:38:33,520
of constraining, localizing the contradictions.

3077
02:38:33,520 --> 02:38:35,600
So there's a contradictory subject matter here,

3078
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:36,920
but as long as you're sufficiently far away

3079
02:38:37,000 --> 02:38:39,400
from that subject matter, you don't have to contradict yourself.

3080
02:38:39,400 --> 02:38:43,040
But the problem is that involves a basically pragmatic approach

3081
02:38:43,040 --> 02:38:46,080
to logic, which is totally acceptable in contemporary

3082
02:38:46,080 --> 02:38:48,320
philosophy, but it's totally an alphabet of Hegel's whole way

3083
02:38:48,320 --> 02:38:49,440
of doing philosophy.

3084
02:38:49,440 --> 02:38:51,800
What we're trying to do in hand-making philosophy

3085
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:56,400
is not like, find the best overall plausible view

3086
02:38:56,400 --> 02:38:58,600
compatible with our starting positions.

3087
02:38:58,600 --> 02:38:59,240
No.

3088
02:38:59,240 --> 02:39:01,080
We're trying to totally systematically

3089
02:39:01,080 --> 02:39:04,520
from a completely indeterminate presuppositionless starting

3090
02:39:04,520 --> 02:39:06,520
point unfold all the philosophy.

3091
02:39:06,520 --> 02:39:08,680
So we need a more systematic explanation

3092
02:39:08,680 --> 02:39:11,600
of why, when we get to a contradiction,

3093
02:39:11,600 --> 02:39:13,680
we're not just happy with that.

3094
02:39:13,680 --> 02:39:17,320
And I mean, this is a very huge topic in Hegel.

3095
02:39:17,320 --> 02:39:18,880
It will occupy us at various points

3096
02:39:18,880 --> 02:39:20,120
over the course of the semester.

3097
02:39:20,120 --> 02:39:22,320
I think it's just internal that Hegel's conception

3098
02:39:22,320 --> 02:39:26,480
is that thinking strives to overcome a contradiction,

3099
02:39:26,480 --> 02:39:28,680
and thinking is not in agreement with itself.

3100
02:39:28,680 --> 02:39:33,720
It's not fully thinking, except insofar as it

3101
02:39:33,720 --> 02:39:36,760
overcomes contradiction.

3102
02:39:36,760 --> 02:39:37,640
OK.

3103
02:39:37,640 --> 02:39:43,440
I think that is going to be it for today.

3104
02:39:43,440 --> 02:39:45,320
I'll set some reading notes for next week.

3105
02:39:45,320 --> 02:39:47,320
There's a lot of reading on the syllabus for next week.

3106
02:39:47,320 --> 02:39:49,560
It'll take me two weeks to get through all of it,

3107
02:39:49,560 --> 02:39:54,880
try to read absolute knowing, and then experience gratitude.

3108
02:39:58,280 --> 02:40:00,280
We're not reading the whole phenomenology.

3109
02:40:03,720 --> 02:40:04,220
Yeah.

3110
02:40:04,220 --> 02:40:05,200
We'll go back.

3111
02:40:05,200 --> 02:40:06,200
We'll go back.

3112
02:40:06,200 --> 02:40:08,680
We'll read the whole phenomenology.

3113
02:40:08,680 --> 02:40:09,160
Yeah.

3114
02:40:09,160 --> 02:40:10,140
I think it's good.

3115
02:40:10,140 --> 02:40:10,640
Yeah.

3116
02:40:10,640 --> 02:40:11,140
Yeah.

3117
02:40:11,140 --> 02:40:12,140
I think it's good.

3118
02:40:12,140 --> 02:40:12,640
Yeah.

3119
02:40:12,640 --> 02:40:13,140
It's good.

3120
02:40:13,140 --> 02:40:13,640
Yeah.

3121
02:40:13,640 --> 02:40:14,140
It's good.

3122
02:40:14,140 --> 02:40:14,640
It's good.

3123
02:40:14,640 --> 02:40:15,120
It's good.

3124
02:40:15,120 --> 02:40:15,620
It's good.

3125
02:40:15,620 --> 02:40:16,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3126
02:40:16,120 --> 02:40:16,620
Yeah.

3127
02:40:16,620 --> 02:40:17,120
Yeah.

3128
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:17,620
Yeah.

3129
02:40:17,620 --> 02:40:18,120
Yeah.

3130
02:40:18,120 --> 02:40:18,620
Yes.

3131
02:40:18,620 --> 02:40:19,120
Thank you.

3132
02:40:19,120 --> 02:40:21,120
Thank you for showing questions.

3133
02:40:21,120 --> 02:40:22,120
Oh, OK.

3134
02:40:22,120 --> 02:40:24,120
One, two, three.

3135
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:24,620
OK.

3136
02:40:24,620 --> 02:40:26,620
Mr. Brown said that it's OK.

3137
02:40:26,620 --> 02:40:27,120
OK.

3138
02:40:27,120 --> 02:40:27,620
Thank you.

3139
02:40:27,620 --> 02:40:28,620
It's not that it's OK.

3140
02:40:28,620 --> 02:40:29,120
It's OK.

3141
02:40:29,120 --> 02:40:29,620
Yeah.

3142
02:40:29,620 --> 02:40:30,120
It's OK.

3143
02:40:30,120 --> 02:40:31,620
Yes.

3144
02:40:31,620 --> 02:40:33,120
It's not really about politics anymore.

3145
02:40:34,020 --> 02:40:36,020
It's about transformation.

3146
02:40:36,020 --> 02:40:36,520
It's about transformation.

3147
02:40:36,520 --> 02:40:37,020
