500	5000	So the project of the phenomenology of spirit
5000	9560	is to determine what knowledge is or what knowing is.
9560	11800	And the reason that we want to do that
11800	15720	is to determine whether knowledge of the absolute
15720	20840	is possible or whether, as Kant argued in the first critique,
20840	24680	the absolute lies beyond the limits, at least,
24680	27200	of theoretical knowledge we're going to be in.
27200	29760	Now, what the absolute is for Hegel
29840	33280	is something that it's going to take us a while to see.
33280	36640	And there's kind of no, I don't think
36640	40080	it's probably helpful to say the Hegelian formula of what
40080	42840	the absolute idea is before we get there.
42840	44720	So the short version is it's what
44720	48680	Hegel will call the absolute idea at the end of the logic.
48680	51800	Before we get there, you can think of it as God.
51800	56120	A little bit better, you can think of it as Spinoza's God.
56120	57720	A little bit better, you can think of it
57840	61920	as the unconditioned in Kant.
61920	63560	And even better than that would be
63560	68080	if you thought of it as neither subjective, so neither
68080	72120	a mind nor nature, but something that's both.
72120	75200	What the hell that means, you'll see.
75200	80280	So Hegel then discusses what I call
80280	83960	the meta-epistemological problem, a problem about how
83960	86640	we determine what the correct epistemology is,
86640	89800	what the correct account of what knowing is.
89800	93480	And the problem is, how do we decide,
93480	95840	not just between different knowledge claims,
95840	98240	but between different epistemologies?
98240	100920	So if I claim to know that Fargo is
100920	104520	the capital of North Dakota, and you claim that I don't know
104520	107640	that because it's false, but we share the same epistemology,
107640	113240	namely looking at an atlas, then that's not a big problem.
113240	116040	But if you and I have different epistemologies,
116040	118560	and I claim I know that God exists
118560	120840	on the basis of immediate religious state,
120840	123920	then you say, well, you couldn't know whether God exists,
123920	126520	because the proposition God exists appears nowhere
126520	127760	in natural science.
127760	130440	Well, first of all, we both have really shitty epistemologies.
130440	133480	But secondly, and arguably the second one
133480	138200	is worse than the first, there's no way
138200	142360	to adjudicate which of us has the correct conception
142360	144640	of knowledge on the basis of which we could then
144640	148040	adjudicate who knows what they claim to be.
148040	159400	So Hegel relates this to the problem of the criterion,
159400	162760	which was originally formulated by sextus empiricus
162760	165400	in the outlines of purinism.
165400	169600	And the problem of the criterion takes the form of a dilemma.
169600	174080	Either we have some can someone makes a knowledge claim,
174080	176080	and they have a certain conception of knowledge.
176080	177840	They claim to know that God exists
177840	181360	on the basis of immediate religious faith.
181360	186040	We either apply their own conception of knowledge,
186040	189280	in which case trivially, their knowledge claim
189280	191840	is going to be vindicated.
191840	194620	So if we either, for each person's
194620	198360	conception of knowledge, we simply apply it to itself,
198360	201000	everyone's going to pass that task.
201000	203240	The other possibility is that we apply
203240	205160	a different conception of knowledge.
205160	207480	The problem with that is that looks question made.
207480	210880	Someone says, I know that God exists
210880	213000	on the basis of immediate religious faith.
213000	215840	And then I say, well, that epistemology
215840	217960	doesn't justify that knowledge claim,
217960	220680	because that epistemology fails the criterion
220680	222040	of my epistemology.
222040	224920	Namely, you know those and only those things
224920	228520	that appear as propositions in empirical natural science.
228520	230580	I've banked the question against the person
230580	232920	who has a different criterion of knowledge
232920	235600	or a different conception of what knowledge is.
235600	239760	So Hegel's solution is a version of the first one,
239760	245360	where we apply some conception of knowledge to itself.
245360	248160	But the difference is he thinks that these conceptions
248160	251360	of knowledge, or concepts, as he calls them
251360	256680	in the phenomenology, typically do not agree with themselves.
256680	258960	When you look at them, what you see
258960	261880	is their conception of knowledge and their conception
261900	265980	of the object of knowledge don't agree.
265980	269380	And now you might think that's very artificial.
269380	272020	But actually, if you look at a lot of epistemology,
272020	274380	certainly in the history of philosophy,
274380	278500	you'll find it is very often these problems do arise.
278500	281500	If you read Locke, it's very unclear how Locke
281500	284540	thinks he knows all of the things he thinks he knows,
284540	286380	because he thinks he knows everything
286380	289660	he knows through sensation, ultimately.
289680	293200	But that he claims to know that God exists,
293200	296800	that there are substances with powers that are extended,
296800	298400	or at least have primary qualities that
298400	300600	resemble our ideas of them.
300600	304640	And it's very unclear from Locke how he could know any
304640	306280	of the things he claims to know.
306280	309160	Likewise, the My Little Toy epistemology,
309160	312480	the person who knows only the propositions enumerated
312480	314400	in the empirical natural sciences, which
314400	315880	here's one of the propositions.
315880	317560	Here's a proposition that occurs nowhere
317560	319200	in empirical natural science.
319220	321780	You know all and only those things
321780	324300	that are stated in the empirical natural science.
324300	326460	But their own epistemology, they don't
326460	328580	know what they claim to know.
328580	333000	So Hegel's solution, which is to examine
333000	337140	the internal coherence of these concepts of knowledge,
337140	342220	is more productive than it might at first appear.
342220	344900	So what Hegel is going to then engage in
344900	348400	is an imminent or internal critique
348400	351400	of various conceptions of knowledge,
351400	360680	or as he calls them, forms or shapes of consciousness.
360680	361760	Gestadens b√ºliskes.
364760	367600	Now they're imminent because we are not
367600	370720	going to impose our own criteria of knowledge
370720	372440	on these shapes of consciousness.
372440	375100	We're going to examine them purely internally
375100	377840	and see whether their conception of knowledge
377840	380720	matches their conception of the object of knowledge.
380720	382460	That is to say, whether you could
382460	385060	know, according to their conception of what knowledge
385060	387940	is, the object of knowledge according to their conception
387940	390580	of the object of knowledge.
390580	396740	Now Hegel adopts for expository or analytic purposes
396740	401060	a kind of abstract model of what consciousness is.
401060	406860	And that is we have consciousness,
406860	414620	we have an object, which we call the in itself,
414620	419540	because it isn't reducible to its being for consciousness,
419540	424140	and we have the relationship of that object for consciousness,
424140	427300	how it is for consciousness, which
427300	432620	is another way of describing it.
432620	434980	Now a few comments about this.
434980	438060	One, you might say, but wait, aren't there
438060	441900	conceptions of knowledge on which consciousness knows itself?
441900	443140	Absolutely.
443140	445700	But we're going to unfold those in the course
445700	446940	of the phenomenon.
446940	449820	So we start with what Hegel thinks
449820	455100	of as the most immediate natural conception of knowledge, one
455100	457380	in which you know something that is distinct from
457380	459420	and irreducible to your knowledge of it.
459420	462460	That's what Hegel characterizes as consciousness.
466620	473900	Now the question is going to be, does this relation,
473900	478340	as consciousness conceive of it, constitute knowledge
478340	481380	of this object as consciousness conceives it?
481380	484660	Another question is, where are these conceptions coming from?
484660	489260	They're coming from consciousness itself.
489260	491580	Or as Hegel will say, consciousness
491580	494180	is the concept of itself.
494180	496900	Consciousness has a conception of it.
496900	500860	That means in the ordinary sense of self-consciousness,
500860	503380	consciousness is self-conscious from the beginning
503380	505420	of the phenomenon.
505420	508620	In the ordinary sense of not only knowing objects,
508620	510980	but also having some conception of what you're
510980	513140	doing in knowing objects, who you are,
513140	515020	what knowledge is, what the object is,
515020	518740	self-consciousness is present from the very beginning.
518740	522220	Self-consciousness in Hegel's conception,
522220	525300	in the technical sense in which it emerges in the phenomenology,
525300	529540	refers to review on which what knowledge fundamentally
529540	532620	is, is self-consciousness, so that consciousness doesn't
532620	534140	fundamentally know an object.
534140	536940	It knows itself knowing an object.
536940	539820	So that we're not going to get to in this case.
539820	541460	You don't think that somehow consciousness
541460	543180	has no conception of itself.
543180	546900	Because if it did from the first page of the phenomenology,
546900	547820	the project would fail.
553700	559940	If this doesn't match this as consciousness conceives of it,
559940	562940	then this is not a way of knowing this
562940	564660	as consciousness conceives of it,
564660	569420	and this shape of consciousness contradicts it.
569460	573900	But now if this shape of consciousness contradicts itself,
573900	579140	the result is not what Hegel calls an abstract negation.
579140	582060	That is to say, we just give up on knowledge.
582060	587580	The result is what Hegel calls a determinate negation.
587580	591900	Or that is to say, a new shape of consciousness, which
591900	597340	is determinately, specifically, not this shape of consciousness.
597340	599700	And the new shape of consciousness,
599700	605060	if this is object one, object two
605060	609700	is the being of object one for consciousness.
613980	616740	So the idea is we have some conception of knowing.
616740	618780	We have some conception of the object of knowledge.
618780	622020	That turns out not to be a way of knowing that object.
622020	624700	So then what results from that is not, well,
624700	626380	let's just give up on knowing.
626380	630300	But oh, what we can know is objects
630300	633500	insofar as they can be for consciousness in this way.
633500	639060	And a very good example of this is,
639060	641300	in the beginning of the Transcendent of Critique of Pure
641300	643580	Reason, Kant's first view, this is
643580	645740	a kind of slightly hokey, big alien reading
645740	647940	of the beginning of the Critique of Pure Reason,
647940	650900	you could think of the first shape of consciousness
650900	654860	in the Critique of Pure Reason as transcendental realism.
655500	657220	What we know is things in themselves,
657220	659180	totally mind-dependent objects, and we
659180	661420	know them in their mind-dependent nature.
661420	664940	And we know them through their effects upon our sensibility.
664940	666580	And then the argument of the first critique
666580	668500	very early on in the Transcendental Aesthetic
668500	672300	is that that way of knowing, sensible cognition,
672300	674540	is not a way of knowing things in themselves.
674540	678080	So then the second shape of consciousness,
678080	680620	Kant's own view, Transcendental Idealism,
680620	682500	is we know the being of consciousness
682500	684500	of the first object for consciousness.
684500	687580	What we know is not things in themselves
687580	689700	via sensory cognition.
689700	692060	We know the being of them for sensory cognition.
692060	695100	That is to say, their appearance is sensory cognition.
695100	697900	So the second object is the being of the first object
697900	698900	for consciousness.
698900	701740	In this case, the appearing of things in themselves
701740	703420	to sensory cognition.
703420	705300	That's just an illustration.
705300	710540	So now we have a conception of how the phenomenology moves.
710540	713900	That is to say, how we go from one shape of consciousness
713900	715780	to the next.
715780	717940	A complete account would have to also include
717940	719260	an account of where we start.
719260	721780	But we're going to spend a lot of today talking about that.
721780	724340	So I'm going to bracket that for now.
724340	727740	Where does the phenomenology end?
727740	731460	The phenomenology will end.
731460	732580	Oh, we have some math.
739180	741620	All right.
741620	749860	The phenomenology will end when the relation of, let's say,
749860	752620	consciousness, although it won't be called consciousness
752620	754660	anymore, for reasons I'll go into,
754660	767980	or the relation of consciousness to the in itself,
767980	772780	where these things are so tightly identified
772780	776780	that no possible gap between being for itself
776780	780180	and being for consciousness could possibly arise.
780180	782580	That is to say, where being in itself
782580	785740	is being for consciousness, and being for consciousness
785740	788380	is being for being in itself.
788380	791220	Now, there's various names for that that Hegel has.
791220	797180	One is, where truth becomes identical to certainty.
797180	801340	One of the names for the in itself is truth.
801340	803300	Another name for it is, another name
803300	806220	for being for consciousness is certainty.
806220	809300	So where truth and certainty are so closely identified
809300	811820	that none of the skeptical problems
811820	813820	that undermine forms of consciousness
813820	815660	could possibly arise.
815660	818580	The official name for this is absolute knowing.
818580	819740	That's where the book ends.
822660	824780	OK.
824780	828180	So the book ends with section absolute knowing,
828180	830420	or absolute knowledge, absolute citizen.
830420	832620	I've put it on the reading next week,
832620	834740	because although the idea of this class
834740	837660	is let's read all the parts of Hegel you can read,
837660	841740	I want you to also have a sense of what I'm sparing you.
841740	844340	So try to read absolute knowing.
844340	847300	You won't really succeed.
847300	851140	It's kind of unreadable.
851140	855300	Just a word further about reading in this class,
855300	861700	if I were you, I would expect to read every text,
861700	865820	every one of the readings in this class, three times.
865820	868900	Read it once, and you'll be like, what is going on?
868900	870380	I sort of a vague sense.
870380	873620	Read it a second time, you'll understand much better.
873620	877820	So the good news with Hegel is you do actually understand it
877820	879500	the more you read it.
879500	881620	Sometimes it won't feel that way.
881620	884900	Now the phenomenology of getting really into Hegel,
884900	887340	phenomenology in the ordinary sense of what it feels like,
887340	890700	is you're constantly understanding it better.
890700	893500	So you're tempted into the fallacy.
893500	896020	Eventually, I'll understand it all.
896020	899460	But constant improvement doesn't mean
899460	902220	that you'll ever reach any finite value,
902220	905900	because it might plateau.
905900	907180	This is my worry.
907180	908460	This is what keeps me up.
908460	909700	This is time.
909700	913100	This is staying to understanding.
913100	916060	And then actual understanding would be here.
916060	916940	But who knows?
916940	920140	But I'm constantly increasing every time I'm going up,
920140	921700	ever less.
921700	926340	So let me just say a few more things.
926340	928820	I forgot to say something about course mechanics.
928820	935100	My office hours this week are.
938460	952100	Wednesday 4.30 to 6, and Friday 3 to 4.
952100	955420	My office hours will vary from week to week,
955420	958180	because there's all these different job searches going
958180	959620	on in the philosophy department.
959620	962260	And I have to attend some of them.
962260	965940	Some of you have asked me about secondary literature.
965940	968860	My attitude towards secondary literature
968860	973340	is the attitude towards those of you who have cool Gen X
973340	977180	parents probably have towards your doing drugs, which
977180	979940	is they tell you, do not do them.
979940	983140	But if you were to do drugs, your parents
983140	986220	would give you advice on how to do them safely.
986220	989260	They would tell you, OK, don't do heroin.
989260	990900	But if you could smoke a little weed,
990900	993140	we're not going to throw you out of the house.
993140	995580	So my advice is do not do drugs.
996060	997420	Do not read secondary literature.
997420	999980	But if you're going to, I would prefer
999980	1002860	you do it in a controlled, safe environment.
1002860	1005940	And you do the marijuana equivalent of Hegel
1005940	1008740	secondary literature rather than the fentanyl equivalent.
1008740	1011060	I won't even tell you what the fentanyl equivalent of Hegel
1011060	1012460	secondary literature is, because I don't
1012460	1013860	want you to know about it.
1013860	1016340	So if you come to me and you say,
1016340	1020020	stay, I am going to read secondary literature.
1020020	1021220	I'll try to talk you out of it.
1021220	1024940	But if I fail to, I'll give you some advice on what to read.
1025540	1026700	So another analogy.
1026700	1030940	Reading the secondary literature,
1030940	1033900	it's the older version of using AI.
1033900	1036420	So why is it bad to use AI?
1036420	1037820	Do you learn nothing?
1037820	1040860	Are all the answers on Claude or Chachupiti wrong?
1040860	1042780	No, you can learn stuff from that.
1042780	1048460	But if you use AI, you do not develop your own capacities
1048460	1049580	till now.
1049580	1051260	And that is what an education is about.
1051260	1053820	An education is not about us telling you stuff
1053820	1055140	that you didn't know.
1055140	1057260	You could do that on your own.
1057260	1060420	An education is about developing your own capacities.
1060420	1065260	And when you use AI, you do not develop your own capacities.
1065260	1068340	The aim of learning is not that it be known the P.
1068340	1072460	It is for me to know the P. So when
1072460	1074620	you read secondary literature, what you do not develop
1074620	1077540	is your own capacity to read and engage
1077540	1080500	in philosophical text.
1080500	1083460	That was my little speech about why I hate AI
1084100	1087620	and why I hate secondary literature.
1087620	1090860	So another thing that I want to emphasize,
1090860	1095340	the phenomenology of spirit is a conceptual development.
1095340	1097900	So we talk about a process or a development
1097900	1100100	in phenomenology of spirit, a sequence
1100100	1102980	of shapes of consciousness.
1102980	1107180	This is not a historical or temporal sequence.
1107180	1112740	Although these shapes can be and are exhibited historically,
1112740	1115540	they correspond, to varying degrees,
1115540	1118620	to conceptions of knowing, conceptions
1118620	1121500	of the relation of the subject to the object that
1121500	1126660	have been present historically in different periods of history.
1126660	1129660	Now there's a distinction in the phenomenology,
1129660	1131740	which will come up numerous times
1131740	1136740	in this class between what is for consciousness
1136740	1138380	and what is for us.
1138380	1144780	I'm looking for a special chalk that I've already lost.
1148780	1149740	Under the whiteboard.
1149740	1150820	Under the whiteboard.
1150820	1152700	Is that not it?
1152700	1154300	No, it is not.
1154300	1158700	So I think I need the glasses to find the chalk.
1158700	1160380	This will be sorted out later.
1160380	1162860	So there's a distinction in the phenomenology
1162860	1165900	between what is for consciousness.
1168380	1172300	And what is for us.
1175020	1180660	Sometimes, Hegel uses the term in itself.
1180660	1183820	So that marks the distinction between what
1183820	1186940	a given shape of consciousness is aware of.
1186940	1187500	You're counted.
1190620	1193300	What is imminent to a given shape of consciousness?
1193300	1194900	What a given shape of consciousness
1194900	1197220	is aware of of itself?
1197220	1199420	What is for us is something that we
1199420	1201420	understand about that shape of consciousness,
1201420	1204100	but it doesn't understand about itself.
1204100	1206620	So we, as the readers of the phenomenology,
1206620	1208420	sometimes called the phenomenological observer,
1208420	1212420	will note certain things about shapes of consciousness.
1212420	1214780	That's not going to work.
1214780	1216620	That's kind of stupid.
1216620	1217740	Hegel never said that.
1217740	1221140	Or this sort of is like a previous shape of consciousness.
1221140	1223060	Or you can tell that this is going to be a problem.
1223060	1226900	Or consciousness will face this problem.
1226900	1230220	Those are not imminent remarks for consciousness.
1233780	1235540	So one other remark.
1235540	1237540	I talked about this a little bit last time,
1237540	1239620	and I felt like what I did so really unclearly.
1242780	1246260	Hegel uses, I'll just encompass the questions in a second.
1246260	1248300	Hegel is very typical of Hegel.
1248300	1251460	So there's this book called the Hegel dictionary.
1251460	1253260	If you were to read secondary literature,
1253260	1255260	which you should not do, you might be aware of it.
1255260	1258740	And the joke about the Hegel dictionary is every entry,
1258740	1261100	ultimately, if you read all the entries,
1261100	1263900	they ultimately just go back to idea or spirit.
1263900	1265980	Because everything is just another synonym
1265980	1267380	for idea or spirit.
1267380	1272140	So in Hegel, there's this problem of massive,
1272140	1273780	this multiplication of terms that all
1273780	1276380	refer to the same thing, but they mean different things.
1276380	1279380	Or there are different modes of presentation of one
1279380	1280940	underlying reality.
1281020	1295940	So consciousness, self-consciousness, reason,
1295940	1300060	and spirit in the phenomenology really all
1300060	1303060	refer to the same thing.
1303060	1306060	But they refer to that underlay.
1306060	1307420	They refer to spirit.
1307420	1310900	They refer to different grades or degrees
1310900	1314660	of that thing's conception of itself.
1314660	1319820	So that means they are all spirit in itself,
1319820	1324420	but they are not yet spirit for itself.
1324420	1328180	Spirit is in and for itself fully and totally
1328180	1329420	only at the end of the book.
1329420	1331820	Only at the end of the book are we
1331820	1333620	talking about a shape of consciousness
1333620	1338220	that is fully and completely aware of what it is.
1338220	1340900	But all along, they're in itself spirit.
1340900	1345860	So in itself sometimes means something like implicitly.
1345860	1350380	Well, for itself means explicitly.
1350380	1352060	Sorry, the exact opposite.
1356780	1360900	Now, that means when Hegel refers to something,
1360900	1362980	some shape of consciousness as reason,
1363860	1369380	he's referring to it at the highest level of actualization
1369380	1371780	that it is aware of itself.
1371780	1377980	So reason is spirit in itself that is not yet spirit.
1377980	1381380	Sorry, spirit in itself that is not yet spirit for itself.
1381380	1384020	It's only for itself reason.
1384020	1386820	Now, it's also for itself consciousness
1386820	1388100	and self-consciousness.
1388100	1391140	But Hegel doesn't call it that because, or doesn't usually
1391140	1392980	call it that because he wants to draw attention
1392980	1396340	that he's talking about this thing at a level where
1396340	1397700	it's aware of itself as reason.
1401180	1403620	These give rise.
1403620	1406260	And of course, between these is religion.
1406260	1409940	But I'm skipping that because some of you
1409940	1411440	at some point in this class are going
1411440	1414300	to have this lingering suspicion that this is just
1414300	1417380	all super poopy religious stuff.
1417380	1420260	And I'm trying to delay as long as possible
1420980	1423540	the anti-religious reaction to Hegel.
1423540	1425300	So I'm just going to skip the religion thing.
1425300	1427580	So when Hegel talks about reason,
1427580	1431660	he's talking about, in some sense, the same entity.
1431660	1432740	That's not the right word.
1432740	1434860	The same thing, also not the right word.
1434860	1438300	The same phenomenon as consciousness, self-consciousness,
1438300	1443220	and spirit, but at a lower level of its conception
1443220	1446140	of itself, of its understanding of itself as what it is.
1446140	1448660	So the process of the phenomenology of spirit
1448740	1452780	is consciousness coming to itself as spirit,
1452780	1456760	or spirit in itself becoming spirit in and for itself,
1456760	1459420	consciousness becoming fully and completely
1459420	1462300	aware of itself as spirit.
1462300	1463300	OK.
1463300	1465580	Questions about this.
1465580	1466060	Yes.
1466060	1468660	I'm still stumbling a little bit over the fact
1468660	1472100	that in the first distinction between what
1472100	1476900	is for consciousness and what is for us or in itself,
1476900	1480180	how in itself and for us can mean the same thing.
1480180	1481860	For me, they mean the opposite.
1481860	1486180	What is for me, I'm opposing what the object is for me.
1486180	1489740	I'm opposing to be different from what it is in itself.
1489740	1491020	Yes.
1491020	1492740	So OK.
1492740	1497980	So OK, good.
1497980	1506620	So what Hegel means by calling what's for us in itself
1506660	1510660	is that this is what consciousness is only
1510660	1512260	implicitly.
1512260	1516620	What it really is is something that isn't aware of.
1516620	1518980	Yeah.
1518980	1527460	So let me take a non-Hegelian example.
1527460	1539340	You might say the Renaissance doesn't realize
1539340	1544860	that what it is is the dissolution of Catholic era.
1544860	1546340	This is a full example.
1546340	1549340	But in itself, that's what it is.
1549340	1551580	It is this thing that's a better example.
1551580	1555740	Socrates, Hegel actually thinks, the appearance of Socrates
1555740	1558260	within Athenian society is the destruction
1558260	1559420	of Athenian society.
1559420	1562100	Once you have Socrates, the form of life
1562100	1565740	that is classical Athens can survive.
1565740	1569340	So Socrates is in himself the end
1569340	1570900	of the Athenian form of life.
1570900	1573700	But he's not that for himself.
1573700	1576860	That's why he's so surprised they want to put him to death.
1576860	1579460	He's not like, I'm bringing it all to an end, guys.
1579460	1581180	Because if he was, then they'd be like,
1581180	1583420	well, we have to kill you.
1583420	1585000	So there's a distinction between what
1585080	1587320	something is in itself implicitly,
1587320	1589400	but not yet if it's developed and realized for.
1589400	1595240	And what we as the observers can see on who knows what grounds,
1595240	1598000	it will eventually become and become
1598000	1600440	aware of itself explicitly as.
1600440	1601440	There was another one.
1601440	1602840	Yes.
1602840	1607080	Can we say consciousness and knowledge or experience?
1607080	1608280	No.
1608280	1613200	So experience, the technical meaning of experience in Hegel
1613200	1614720	is the process.
1614720	1620480	It's this.
1620480	1623560	It's one shape of consciousness undermining itself
1623560	1624840	and being replaced by an object.
1624840	1626520	That's what experience is.
1626520	1628960	So this, consciousness of an object,
1628960	1633120	is not technically what Hegel means by experience.
1633120	1633600	Yeah.
1633600	1637680	So just back to movie star twist, is that right?
1637680	1642800	So you said initially that knowing is often
1642800	1647560	a conflict with consciousness, perceive of the object.
1647560	1649440	Can you elaborate on that?
1649440	1652400	Because that's two kinds of a relation.
1652400	1655280	And if consciousness perceive of the object,
1655280	1657080	wouldn't that also be knowing?
1657080	1657600	Yeah, OK.
1657600	1659960	So first of all, I just want to note, no,
1659960	1662760	and this is relevant to the beginning of the book,
1662760	1667160	self-certainty, your sense of certainty.
1667160	1669160	So if this chalk is supposed to not get all over,
1669160	1670720	it means the pot is not succeeding.
1671640	1673200	It's because you wait for it.
1673200	1674560	It's probably because I wait.
1674560	1675600	It's probably my fault.
1680600	1683840	So knowing here is an incredible,
1683840	1686280	that's a very, very general term.
1686280	1690360	So we're not assuming at the beginning of the phenomenology
1690360	1694000	that knowing is anything like you would normally
1694000	1695800	assume in philosophy.
1695800	1698480	So it doesn't have a propositional object.
1698480	1701240	It isn't true justified belief.
1701240	1703560	It isn't opposed to illusion.
1703560	1706520	It isn't opposed to mere opinion or belief.
1706520	1709440	In sensuous certainty, just to anticipate,
1709440	1713160	knowing is just, sensuous certainty can't really
1713160	1715080	say this, but it's just sensuously
1715080	1716480	apprehending something.
1716480	1719200	This is knowing.
1719200	1720440	That's knowing.
1720440	1724440	Now that means that knowing in its most general sense
1724440	1727960	is just the being of an object for consciousness.
1728040	1731440	And so before we get, Hegel will develop
1731440	1735600	over the course of phenomenology notions of knowledge
1735600	1737040	that look more like what we normally
1737040	1739000	talk about in epistemology.
1739000	1740960	But at the very beginning, it's just
1740960	1745120	whether this can be an object of consciousness.
1745120	1746000	Yeah.
1746000	1749400	So for consciousness, consciousness
1749400	1750960	cannot see its own developments.
1750960	1752720	It's only from the standpoint of for us
1752720	1754120	that I can see the whole program.
1754120	1754840	At the beginning.
1754840	1755360	Yes.
1755360	1758440	Eventually, consciousness will become self-conscious
1758440	1761720	or aware of its development in the phenomenology.
1761720	1763080	We won't get there.
1763080	1764080	Yeah.
1764080	1766960	I want to clarify imminence, because, for example,
1766960	1773080	in your example, if Socrates himself is not aware of it
1773080	1775960	or himself, he's not aware of the fact
1775960	1778520	that he's a distraction of being in society,
1778520	1782000	then the fact that Socrates is such a distraction
1782000	1785560	would still be imminent, because it's not?
1785560	1789840	If you said it in the courtroom in which Socrates
1789840	1792320	is being tried, no.
1792320	1796200	But it would be imminent if you could,
1796200	1799160	as a Hegelian philosopher, figure out
1799160	1802360	the underlying structure of Athenian society
1802360	1807840	and then show that it cannot allow someone like Socrates
1807840	1809960	within it and that once you even have
1809960	1811800	the possibility of someone like Socrates,
1811920	1813640	it's no longer stable.
1813640	1816880	And that, therefore, historically destroys the Greek city
1816880	1823400	state and give rise eventually to the Roman form of life,
1823400	1825200	then you would have made explicit
1825200	1827120	and you would have done so purely imminently
1827120	1830560	within, so to speak, the logic of these different historically
1830560	1835000	determined shapes of life that Socrates
1835000	1836600	is the end of the Athenian society.
1836600	1838200	But that was merely an illustration.
1838200	1840960	I know, but in that case, it's not
1841200	1844160	imminent for Socrates, but it's imminent for the Athenian
1844160	1845360	society.
1845360	1848200	It can be developed imminently, even
1848200	1851800	if the people in that historical period are not aware of it.
1851800	1854640	Or in other ways, we're getting way ahead of ourselves.
1854640	1859840	History for Hegel is the process of contradictions
1859840	1862360	in themselves being contradictions for themselves.
1862360	1864320	That is to say, implicit contradictions becoming
1864320	1868120	explicit contradictions, people being like, oh, wait.
1868120	1873120	How can it be that all men are created equal in a doubt
1873120	1875120	by the creator of certain inalienable rights
1875120	1879280	if our entire society is founded on the labor of enslave?
1879280	1880840	There was a question over here.
1880840	1881440	Yes.
1881440	1882840	It's just a simple question.
1882840	1885520	So for that process, is Hegel actually
1885520	1888960	being prescriptive or descriptive?
1888960	1890880	Descriptive.
1890880	1891360	Yes.
1891360	1892880	Yeah, just a follow-up.
1892880	1897280	So knowing just become the object of consciousness,
1897280	1901440	how can it be at all with itself or contradict itself?
1901440	1902440	We'll see.
1902440	1903400	We'll see.
1903400	1903880	Yes.
1903880	1905200	Is there some even more meta thing
1905200	1906880	that's supposed to happen to the observer
1906880	1909560	as they move through the shapes of consciousness?
1909560	1910360	Yes.
1910360	1912520	I'm not going to emphasize that in this class,
1912520	1915440	but I'll talk about this a little bit.
1915440	1919720	But you, who I've never read the farm culture before,
1919720	1922400	are supposed to have your consciousness raised
1922400	1925960	to the level of spirit over the course of reading this book.
1925960	1929240	So that is to say, you are all spirit in itself,
1929240	1931840	but not yet spirit for itself, because you are not
1931840	1935880	aware of what you are, namely spirit and what spirit is.
1935880	1938120	So one of the roles the phenomenology of spirit
1938120	1940520	is supposed to play is to get you off to that level.
1940520	1943640	Now, the reason it's supposed to get you off to that level
1943640	1946720	is so that you can then begin Hegelian science.
1946720	1950240	So the phenomenology of spirit is essentially,
1950240	1953040	in a certain way, it's the prerequisite
1953040	1956200	for all of Hegel's classes at the University of Berlin.
1956200	1958480	And in fact, at the beginning of the encyclopedia,
1958480	1961880	he says something to the effect of like,
1961880	1964720	what if you want to take this class without a prerequisite?
1964720	1966840	And the answer is like, you can do that,
1966840	1969800	but there are certain objections you're not allowed to raise.
1969800	1971880	And this book answers all the objections
1971880	1974720	you're not allowed to raise when you take logic
1974720	1977800	at the University of Berlin in the 1820s with Professor
1977800	1979000	Hegel.
1979000	1982240	Now, I should have said this last time, but I didn't say it.
1982720	1984560	So the way you should think about this class
1984560	1986880	is the professor is Hegel.
1986880	1989680	But in classic German professor style,
1989680	1991840	he doesn't show up to his own lectures.
1991840	1995360	He sends his assistant, me, to teach his lectures
1995360	1997360	and to run his office out.
1997360	1999080	So what we're trying to do is figure out
1999080	2002560	what Professor Hegel thought, but he never shows up.
2002560	2006120	So all we have is his books and the guy
2006120	2009320	that he's forced to teach his classes for several years.
2009320	2012600	And also in classic German professor style,
2012600	2015640	we'll then completely ignore me and never help me professionally.
2015640	2018080	OK, that's why.
2018080	2023960	So let's start sense certainty.
2023960	2027760	Before I begin, who found this reading hard?
2027760	2031000	Who found this reading very hard?
2031000	2036480	OK, just to give you an idea of the phenomenology,
2036480	2039360	this is by far the easiest thing in the phenomenology.
2039360	2041760	This is the thing that everyone kind of
2041760	2045280	feels comfortable teaching in the phenomenology.
2045280	2052560	So let us begin with the very opening of sense certainty.
2052560	2056360	Now, in classic style, I have to sit down and read the text.
2056360	2069320	It seems somehow sacrilegious to stand while reading.
2069320	2071840	I don't feel the need to cover my head when reading Hegel,
2071840	2072840	but OK.
2080320	2084400	OK, so let me just dive in.
2084400	2089400	Knowing which is initially our object or immediately
2089400	2094120	can be nothing but immediate knowing of the immediate
2094120	2096360	or of what is.
2096360	2098760	Now, knowing is initially our object.
2098760	2102680	So we have to begin by talking about knowing.
2102680	2105560	We have to begin by talking about a shape of consciousness.
2105560	2108480	Now, this is the beginning.
2108480	2113280	That means we can't have arrived at this shape of consciousness
2113280	2114760	by something else.
2114760	2118680	So it can't have been mediated by a previous shape
2118680	2122320	of consciousness or anything else in knowing.
2122320	2123960	Now, mediation, this is a word you're
2123960	2127600	going to hear a million, million, million times in this class.
2127600	2129960	Just the simplest meaning of mediation,
2129960	2132800	I think just like the most general way
2132800	2137400	to think about it in Hegel, the place you should begin
2137400	2141680	is just mediation just means by means of something else
2141760	2143440	or by means of something else-ness.
2160240	2165000	But now notice, by means of something else
2165000	2170920	involves being one thing rather than another.
2170920	2180960	So mediation goes together with determinism.
2180960	2182760	So let me just give some examples.
2182760	2186360	Mediate knowing is knowing something
2186360	2187960	by knowing something else.
2187960	2190960	The classic example is inference.
2190960	2193880	If I know that Q, because I inferred it from P,
2193880	2198520	and if P then Q, then my knowledge of Q is immediate.
2198520	2201680	But that means if my knowledge is mediated,
2201680	2204280	there are other items of knowledge it is not.
2204280	2209800	It is determinantly Q rather than P or if P then Q.
2209800	2212320	For there to be immediate or inferential knowledge,
2212320	2216240	there has to be determinacy among the propositions.
2216240	2222560	Now, determinacy is being one thing rather than another.
2222560	2230800	Now, why does determinacy require mediation?
2230800	2236600	Because if I'm this rather than that, if I'm x rather than y,
2236600	2242160	I'm x partly by means of not being y.
2242160	2246840	So mediacy and determinacy go together.
2246840	2251120	Now, we have to start immediately.
2251120	2254680	Because this is the beginning, the beginning has to be immediate.
2254680	2256680	It can't be mediated by anything else.
2263520	2269960	But that means it also has to be indeterminate.
2269960	2279480	Now, what does it mean that we have to have an immediate knowing
2279480	2282080	which is initially our object, or immediately,
2282080	2284320	can be nothing but immediate knowing.
2284320	2287720	So we have to have an immediate conception of knowing,
2287720	2291400	not mediated by anything else.
2291400	2295000	If it were knowledge of something mediated,
2295000	2298440	then it wouldn't be an immediate conception of knowing.
2298440	2300760	Because in order for it to be knowledge of that mediated thing
2300760	2303760	or conceive of it, it would have to be knowledge of that thing
2303760	2305320	as opposed to something else.
2305320	2307640	And therefore, it would be mediated by that something else.
2307640	2311480	So we have to immediately start with immediate knowledge,
2311480	2314520	which is knowledge of the immediate.
2314520	2316000	Now, what is knowledge of the immediate?
2316000	2319960	It has to be knowledge of the indeterminate.
2319960	2323040	That is to say, we don't know this rather than that.
2323040	2324360	We just know this.
2324360	2326640	We don't know one object as opposed to another.
2326640	2330320	We just know the object.
2330320	2334600	Now, there's a theme in the sensuous certainty
2334600	2336320	that's going to be super important to this class
2336320	2343040	that I'm going to delay a little bit for the end of class.
2343040	2345560	And I'll just say it right now.
2345560	2349400	So Hegel assumes that what knowledge is
2349400	2351320	is knowledge of what is.
2351320	2353000	You know what is.
2353000	2357200	Just as you think about what is, you judge what is, et cetera.
2357200	2359480	So you can see this from the very first sentence
2359480	2360560	of the phenomenology.
2360560	2367480	It is natural supposition that in philosophy,
2367480	2369680	before one gets down to dealing with what is at issue,
2369680	2373720	namely, the actual cognition of what in truth is.
2373720	2376280	So basic assumption of phenomenology, what you know
2376280	2378360	is what is or what has been.
2378360	2380320	Now, you might ask, but don't I know things?
2380320	2383240	I can know shadows.
2383240	2386960	Not being is in a certain way a kind of being.
2386960	2390320	It's relevant or determinate with respect to being.
2390960	2393720	I want to set the being theme aside for now,
2393720	2395160	because I'll come back to it later,
2395160	2398760	and it's even more abstract than everything else.
2398760	2401440	So we start with an immediate form of knowledge.
2401440	2403840	That knowledge has to be immediate knowledge
2403840	2406040	or knowledge of the immediate.
2406040	2408080	Because otherwise, it would be mediated
2408080	2411320	by something else, some conception of its knowledge
2411320	2412960	as distinct from some other kind of knowledge,
2412960	2414200	and then it wouldn't be the beginning,
2414200	2416000	or knowledge of its object as distinct
2416000	2418800	from some other object, and it wouldn't be immediate.
2418800	2421560	So we know the first shape of consciousness
2421560	2424200	is immediate knowledge of the immediate.
2424200	2430320	It's just so it can't be knowing by mediation,
2430320	2433080	and it can't be knowledge of what is immediate.
2433080	2433800	Why?
2433800	2437240	Because knowledge determines what the object of knowledge is.
2437240	2442040	There has to be a fit between being for consciousness
2442040	2443880	and the object of consciousness.
2443880	2447800	So the being of consciousness, the being for consciousness
2447800	2451920	is immediacy, and the object is immediate.
2451920	2454040	We therefore are to alter nothing in the object
2454040	2455480	as it presents itself, and we must
2455480	2457280	keep our conceptualizing it apart
2457280	2458720	from our apprehending of it.
2458720	2461960	So that means both we as the phenomenological observer
2461960	2467120	simply have to observe what this immediate shape of knowing is.
2467120	2469600	It's not our job to alter it.
2469600	2472480	We have to just observe what this shape of consciousness
2472480	2473840	says about itself.
2473840	2476560	But likewise, this shape of consciousness
2476560	2479560	can't conceptualize its object.
2479560	2480480	Why?
2480480	2485200	Because conceptualizing something is determining it.
2485200	2488080	It's representing it as falling under one concept rather than
2488080	2492880	another, and that involves mediation.
2492880	2497320	Conceptualizing is mediate, so the immediate
2497320	2499360	has to be non-conceptual.
2499360	2500960	Let me just read a little bit from here.
2500960	2503920	The concrete content of sensuous certainty
2503920	2506120	permits itself to appear immediately
2506120	2507800	as the richest cognition.
2507800	2512760	So this shape of consciousness thinks of itself.
2512760	2516440	It's just immediate apprehension of the object.
2516440	2519360	It's sensuous because we're in consciousness,
2519360	2522760	and so we think the object is what determines what knowledge
2522760	2523320	is.
2523320	2526280	There's an object outside of consciousness
2526280	2529000	that is the thing that we have to map or match onto.
2529000	2531600	So it's sensuous, immediate circle.
2531680	2536600	And it thinks of itself as the richest form of cognition
2536600	2543960	because it lets the whole sensuous richness of the world
2543960	2548840	be what it is without bringing it under consciousness.
2548840	2551600	So Hegel is playing off this idea
2551600	2556960	that people had in this period that conceptualizing things
2556960	2560400	deprives them of their life or their richness.
2561320	2564840	Concepts, of course, are only about generalities.
2564840	2567200	I'll get to you in a second what things have in common.
2567200	2571160	And so when you conceptualize, you ignore the infinitely rich
2571160	2573120	particularity of every individual thing.
2573120	2575440	So this form of consciousness thinks,
2575440	2577360	I'm not doing any of that.
2577360	2580080	I'm not desiccating anything or generalizing.
2580080	2584440	I'm just purely apprehending everything immediately
2584440	2588000	in its sensuous richness.
2588000	2589840	Indeed, there's a knowing of an infinite wealth
2590280	2591960	in which no limit is to be found,
2591960	2594280	whether we venture out into the reaches of space and time
2594280	2595960	as the place where that wealth extends itself
2595960	2597680	or when we take a piece out of this pontitude
2597680	2599680	divided and thereby delve into it.
2599680	2603240	So there's no limits because a limit would,
2604160	2605360	if there were a limit,
2605360	2606800	there would be something beyond the limit
2606800	2608840	that would involve mediation.
2608840	2611520	So there's no limits extensively.
2611520	2614160	There's no point beyond sensuous certainty.
2614160	2616600	And there's no limits within the object.
2616600	2618600	Sensuous certainty can dive further into the object,
2618600	2621800	look further and further and further into the object.
2621800	2624200	In addition, it appears as the most veritable
2624200	2626880	where it has not omitted anything from its object
2626880	2629160	because it isn't conceptually determining it.
2629160	2631720	It's not leaving out some of its details
2631720	2634040	and conceptualizing only some of them.
2637000	2640720	But rather has its complete entirety before itself.
2640720	2644160	However, this certainty in fact yields the most abstract
2644160	2646280	and the very poorest truth.
2646280	2649080	It expresses what it knows as this.
2649080	2650400	It is.
2650400	2654000	And its truth only contains the being of the object.
2654000	2656800	Now this is, I wanna separate the being issue
2656800	2659880	from the it issue for the following reason.
2659880	2662760	It can't really properly speaking be the case
2662760	2666960	that what sensuous certainty knows is it is or this is
2666960	2670880	because that it is is not immediate
2670880	2673800	because it involves a subject and a predicate.
2673800	2674800	And so it would involve the difference
2674800	2676320	between a subject and a predicate.
2676320	2678040	It would involve immediate relationship
2678040	2679760	between subject and predicate.
2679760	2683000	It would be determining the it as being.
2683000	2685520	So I wanna focus on it and then I'll come back to it.
2687200	2689600	So now what Hegel is saying, he's gonna argue
2689600	2692560	that contrary to what sensuous certainty thinks,
2692560	2696560	it doesn't know, it isn't the richest
2696560	2700640	and most variegated form of consciousness.
2700640	2703680	In fact, what it does is the most universal and abstract.
2704840	2706160	So just a little bit further.
2706160	2709160	For sensuous certainty, this is what is essential
2709160	2711720	and this pure being where this simple immediacy
2711720	2713400	constitutes its truth.
2713400	2718400	So the truth is this, or it.
2718560	2721440	And being for consciousness certainty
2721440	2724240	is just immediate apprehending.
2724240	2726160	Likewise, as a relation certainty
2726160	2728120	is an immediate pure relation.
2728120	2730920	Consciousness is I, nothing further,
2730920	2732840	a pure this and the singular individual
2732840	2735800	knows a pure this or he knows the singular.
2735800	2739680	So let's just take the first shape of consciousness
2739680	2744400	to be I know this.
2745560	2750080	Where knowledge here is just immediate.
2752560	2755480	So I'm not conceptualizing this.
2755480	2757880	And so this is not an object of concepts.
2757880	2759720	It's not a thing with many properties.
2760720	2762360	All right, yes.
2765320	2768560	What is the root of immediate knowledge?
2768560	2770680	So immediate knowledge is knowledge
2770680	2773160	that isn't mediated by any other knowledge.
2773160	2776600	So the idea is to note, this is what sensuous certainty
2776600	2779840	thinks, to know this, I don't need to know anything else.
2781680	2785840	However, if what I knew about this was that it was a pencil,
2785840	2789760	I would need to know what a pencil is.
2789760	2792560	I would need to know the difference between pencil
2792560	2795560	and a pencil, that is to say the pencil
2795560	2798280	and the universal pencil, et cetera, et cetera.
2798280	2800120	But immediate knowledge is knowledge
2800120	2801840	not by means of anything else.
2803040	2805880	Wherever there's mediation, there's determinacy.
2807000	2809240	Being one thing and not being another.
2809240	2812040	So if there's no immediacy, there's no mediation,
2812040	2813520	there's no determinacy.
2813520	2815960	So I don't know this as opposed to something else.
2815960	2817080	I just know this.
2817080	2820800	So how do I know this if I see it for the first time?
2822040	2823920	That's what knowing is.
2823920	2826400	So you're assuming that to know this,
2826400	2827960	I need to know what it is.
2827960	2829600	I need to bring it under a concept.
2829600	2831720	Sensuous certainty is denying.
2831720	2836040	Sensuous certainty says, this is knowledge.
2838280	2840280	And so is this.
2840280	2842800	And so is this, yeah.
2842800	2846240	Isn't starting with immediate knowledge a kind of immediacy?
2846240	2849400	Because we're starting with immediacy
2849400	2851320	rather than mediacy.
2851320	2852200	Okay, great.
2852200	2853960	So that is gonna be the question.
2853960	2855880	So hold on to that question
2855880	2858480	until we get to the beginning of the science of logic.
2858480	2859920	Because I agree with you.
2859920	2862600	And I think that's the way we save
2862600	2863640	Pedagorean philosophy.
2866080	2867480	Yeah.
2867480	2869320	In the first like, I know or something,
2869320	2871720	it's like, it's as conceptualizing
2871840	2874880	and in the footnote is as conceptually comprehending.
2874880	2876960	Oh, yeah.
2876960	2879880	That's because Terry Pinkard loves to insert
2879880	2882880	his own interpretations into the translation.
2883880	2886520	Which is, so let me just, I'm actually not seeing,
2886520	2888440	where is the footnote actually?
2888440	2890600	It's on the first page and.
2890600	2892120	Yeah, but what sentence does it modify?
2892120	2892960	I have so many.
2892960	2896120	It's the last sentence of 90.
2896120	2896960	The last sentence.
2896960	2899000	Oh, conceptualizing.
2899000	2901360	Yeah, so let's see what that is.
2901360	2903760	That's almost certainly gonna be Begrifen.
2904760	2907120	And Terry loves to translate Begrifen
2907120	2910520	as conceptually comprehending, which is hilarious.
2910520	2911760	Yeah, it's Begrifen.
2911760	2916600	Okay, Begrifen just means comprehending or conceptualizing.
2916600	2918440	It doesn't mean both.
2918440	2920560	That is to say, basic rule of translation.
2920560	2923240	Where there's one word, don't translate it as two words.
2923240	2925520	Okay, like that just doesn't work.
2925520	2930520	Okay, so what that should really be is comprehending.
2932200	2935080	Okay, now the reason he's translated
2935080	2936960	as conceptually comprehending,
2936960	2938720	this is in German, Begrifen,
2941640	2945400	is the word in German for concept is Begrif.
2947360	2948800	That's what a concept is.
2949920	2952600	Which is the noun form of the verb Begrifen,
2952600	2954320	which is also to grasp.
2954320	2956320	So Begrifen is also a grasping.
2957320	2959920	So in some ways, obviously it's a conceptualizing.
2960920	2964760	But in general, the closest thing in English to Begrifen
2964760	2966400	in philosophical texts is comprehending,
2966400	2967760	comprehending something.
2967760	2969280	So you should just translate it as comprehending.
2969280	2972120	Or you could translate it as conceptualizing,
2972120	2973440	but you do not wanna translate it
2973440	2975080	as conceptually comprehending.
2975080	2977880	That's just adding complexity that's not in the original.
2977880	2980520	Okay, so what Hegel is saying is
2980520	2983360	we must not conceptualize this thing.
2984360	2989360	Any, our job is to just ask what sensuous certainty says
2992120	2996600	about itself, not to bring our own concepts to bear
2996600	2999600	on and make sensuous certainty
2999600	3001640	into something that we think it should be.
3002640	3006040	Okay, so now going further,
3006040	3009080	we're gonna skip 92, the end of 93.
3009080	3014080	The I, a knowing that knows the object only
3016040	3018560	for the reason that the object is,
3018560	3022280	but which itself can just as well be as not be.
3022280	3025280	So that means, so just to anticipate,
3025280	3028760	sensuous certainty is gonna undergo various changes
3028760	3031440	over the course of this chapter.
3031440	3033760	So Hegel begins by talking about
3033760	3036520	just the bare abstract idea,
3036560	3037920	or I'm sorry, just you start someone
3037920	3039280	by talking sensuous certainty,
3039280	3042640	and then imminently criticizes it.
3042640	3045600	And then sensuous, he allows sensuous certainty
3045600	3049520	to modify itself in light of those imminent criticisms
3049520	3051960	while remaining sensuous certainty.
3051960	3054680	So the first form of sensuous certainty
3054680	3057280	is one on which, in Hegelian terms,
3057280	3060520	the object, this, is the essence.
3060520	3065520	That means the object determines what it is to know it,
3065520	3067920	which means the object can be there
3069080	3070720	whether or not the subject is,
3070720	3073800	or the subject is purely receptive in knowing the object.
3074680	3078360	So the I, a knowing that knows the object
3078360	3080840	only for the reason that the object is,
3080840	3083960	but which itself can just as well be as not be.
3083960	3087960	So the knowing can be or not be, and the object still is.
3087960	3092400	However the object is, it is the true and the essence.
3092400	3095960	The object is indifferent as to whether it's known or not.
3095960	3098920	The object remains even when it is not known,
3098920	3102160	but if the object does not exist, then there is no known.
3103680	3106680	The object is therefore to be considered
3106680	3110240	in terms of whether, in sensuous certainty itself,
3110240	3112840	it is in fact the kind of essence
3112840	3116320	which sensuous certainty passes it off as being.
3116320	3119600	That is to say, is immediate,
3119720	3123200	is immediate knowing a way of knowing this?
3123200	3124120	That's the question,
3124120	3127080	because that's what sensuous certainty says it is.
3127080	3129800	That is, it is to be considered as to whether this,
3129800	3134280	its concept, its conception of itself,
3134280	3137280	the object and the being of the object forehead,
3137280	3138800	which is to be the essence,
3138800	3142000	corresponds to the way it is present within that certainty.
3142000	3144920	To that end, we need not reflect on the object
3144920	3147240	and mull over what it might be in truth.
3147240	3149960	We need only to consider it as sensuous certainty
3149960	3152200	has it in sensuous certainty itself.
3152200	3154840	That is to say, we just have to do this imminently
3154840	3157800	rather than transcendently, non-imminently,
3157800	3159720	applying our own criteria to value.
3161000	3164200	Therefore, sensuous certainty itself is to be asked,
3164200	3166280	what is this?
3166280	3169480	If we take it in the twofold shape of its being
3169480	3171640	as the now and the here,
3171640	3175840	so one interesting thing about the phenomenology
3175840	3179280	is Hegel assumes from page one
3179280	3181640	that consciousness is consciousness
3181640	3183040	of objects in space and time.
3184840	3187640	So whatever the project of the phenomenology is,
3187640	3191040	he's not trying to answer the skeptic who's like,
3191040	3193680	I didn't say anything about space and time.
3194680	3197760	And as we'll see, he even assumes some very natural things
3197760	3199640	about the structure of space and time,
3199640	3201920	namely that it's divisible.
3202920	3207400	So whatever the phenomenology is supposed to do,
3207400	3210280	it's not supposed to refute the skeptic
3210280	3214080	who denies that objects outside the mind
3214080	3215320	are in space and time,
3215320	3217960	nor is it supposed to derive space and time
3217960	3220040	from something more fundamental,
3220040	3223280	which weirdly is part of the project of the Hegel system.
3225160	3226000	Notoriously.
3226920	3230800	So what I know can be characterized just purely imminently.
3230800	3232760	We're just unfolding what's sent to a certainty.
3232760	3234400	What I know is this here now,
3236680	3238840	if we take it in the twofold shape of its being
3238840	3240280	as the now and here,
3240280	3242200	then the dialectic,
3242200	3244000	where the, remember the dialectic
3244000	3246640	is the internal imminent dialectic
3246640	3248320	of a Hegel consciousness,
3248320	3251560	where it generates contradictions of itself
3251560	3253680	and tries to resolve them.
3253680	3256360	The dialectic, which it has in itself,
3256360	3260200	will take on a form as intelligible as the this itself.
3260200	3263640	To the question, what is the now?
3263640	3267120	We answer, for example, the now is the night.
3267120	3268400	So if we ask sensuous conscious,
3268400	3271200	so this is a slightly artificial example
3271200	3272360	that Hegel uses to make a point.
3272360	3273760	So I'll just read it and then I'll explain
3273760	3275080	what the point is.
3275080	3277820	We answer, for example, the now is night.
3277820	3280080	In order to put the truth of this sensuous certainty
3280080	3282800	to the test, a simple experiment will suffice.
3282800	3284480	We write down this truth.
3284480	3287480	A truth cannot be lost by being written down anymore
3287480	3289800	than it can be lost by our preserving it.
3289800	3293600	And if now, this midday, we look at this truth,
3293600	3295200	which has been written down,
3295200	3298120	we will have to say that it has become rather staged.
3298120	3301560	Okay, so the idea is the sentence,
3308160	3309320	now is night.
3319800	3324800	Is true, say, at 11 p.m. and is false at 2 p.m.
3336600	3341600	So what Hegel is doing is arguing that
3341600	3346600	in so far as sensuous certainty
3349200	3352900	says that knowledge is I know this here now,
3355680	3360280	it cannot make sense of now.
3361320	3362680	Why?
3362680	3366860	Because Hegel argues in the next paragraph
3366860	3370240	that now is a universal.
3370240	3375240	That is to say, it applies to multiple different times.
3376000	3381000	It applies to every time at the time at which it's uttered.
3381080	3384160	So for any time, now uttered at that time
3384160	3385300	refers to that time.
3386200	3391200	Now refers to noon, 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.
3393440	3398160	Okay, now why would it be bad
3398160	3401660	if the object of knowledge for sensuous certainty
3401660	3402780	were a universal?
3403680	3408680	It would be bad because a universal is a one over a minute.
3410460	3413000	It applies to multiple particulars.
3414520	3419520	But that means it is distinct from the particulars
3419740	3423500	it applies to, and they are distinct from one another,
3424500	3429500	which means that to know a universal requires determinancy.
3433260	3435980	This is determinately this rather than that,
3435980	3438220	and determinately a particular rather than a universal,
3438220	3440580	and a universal is a determinately a universal
3440580	3442460	rather than a particular.
3442460	3446820	That means knowledge of a universal requires mediation.
3447900	3449700	You know what a universal is
3449700	3452740	by means of knowing it isn't a particular,
3452780	3454980	namely the things that it can instantiate.
3454980	3457580	But there can't be anything immediate
3457580	3460000	in the object of sensuous certainty,
3460000	3463840	so this cannot characterize its object.
3464780	3466780	Now in contemporary philosophy,
3466780	3470180	it's very weird to think of now as a universal.
3471220	3473900	If you said that in contemporary philosophy of language,
3473900	3475660	class, Imogen Dickey would kill you.
3476740	3480140	So the more natural thing is to think of it now
3480140	3481940	as what we call an indexical.
3482740	3487460	Which is to say, something that refers to different things
3487460	3490740	under different contexts of utterances, contexts of utterance.
3490740	3495740	So now, as uttered at time t,
3501020	3504840	refers to time t.
3506540	3508300	So that's the more contemporary way
3508300	3510980	of expressing the nature of now.
3511020	3513500	That it's an indexical rather than a universal.
3513500	3515940	But Hegel's point remains,
3515940	3519660	because this also requires the difference
3519660	3522420	between individual times
3522420	3526220	and a general quantifier over times.
3526220	3528720	This says for all times,
3531340	3534680	so in order for sensuous certainty
3534680	3537540	to have an indexical expression
3537540	3539540	in the objects of its knowledge,
3539540	3543020	it would have to understand indexicals.
3543940	3547840	Which involves understanding that one expression
3547840	3550740	can refer to different things at different times.
3550740	3555240	That requires determinacy, requires mediation.
3556100	3561100	So the same argument eliminates the indexical now
3562180	3564260	from being within the content
3564260	3566260	of sensuous certainty's knowledge.
3566260	3571260	The same arises for Hugh,
3572580	3574100	as Hegel goes on to say.
3575980	3580620	We also express the sensuous, this is 98.
3580620	3584140	The same case comes up in the other form of the this,
3584140	3585900	namely in the here.
3585900	3588460	For example, here is the tree.
3588460	3590780	I turn around this truth vanishes,
3590780	3593500	and it has inverted itself into its contrary.
3593500	3596600	Here there is not a tree, but rather a house.
3596600	3598780	The here itself does not disappear,
3598780	3601460	rather it endures in the disappearance of the house,
3601460	3604460	the tree, and it is indifferent to being a house, a tree.
3604460	3607900	But this shows itself again to be a mediated simplicity
3607900	3609180	or as being universality.
3609180	3612760	So once again, Hegel thinks of here as a universal.
3612760	3615420	That's slightly odd in a contemporary perspective
3615420	3617120	to think that here is a universal
3617120	3620220	that's instantiated by every location.
3620220	3621540	It's more natural to think of it
3621540	3626540	as a indexical for all locations L.
3630420	3635420	As utter at L refers to L.
3642100	3645500	If you want me to write out the clause for this.
3645500	3646700	So the problem with this, right,
3646700	3648600	is it depends on where you're pointing.
3648600	3650900	And a disgraced former colleague of mine,
3650940	3652740	Colin McGinn, has this famous paper
3652740	3654540	where he tries to settle the question
3654540	3657700	exactly which object is referred to by pointing.
3657700	3661500	And so he literally has in this paper a diagram of a hand.
3662660	3663900	And then there's this question of like,
3663900	3666340	well, it's obviously, it doesn't have to be exactly.
3666340	3669900	So like, you know, there's like a cone of reference
3669900	3671720	and there's like an empirical question,
3671720	3673700	what is the angle theta?
3673700	3677720	Like if I say, can I say this
3677720	3679100	and be referring to the lectern?
3679100	3680580	No, it's too far away.
3681220	3683040	There, can I be referring to the lectern?
3683040	3685020	Questionable, definitely.
3685020	3687620	So somewhere there's this vague boundary
3687620	3690240	of the theta of reference.
3690240	3691580	This is what, okay, this is what people
3691580	3693380	like Colin McGinn spend their time doing.
3695700	3696540	Okay.
3697700	3699980	The fact that it was a hand is deeply ironic.
3699980	3701340	Okay.
3701340	3706340	So even if we think of here as an indexical
3710740	3712820	expression rather than a universal,
3712820	3714780	the same point applies.
3714780	3719240	Because this requires there being a distinction
3719240	3722900	between the general term location
3722900	3724780	and the individual locations.
3724780	3726820	That is to say, since you're certain
3726820	3730020	you would have to understand differences among locations
3730020	3735020	and the difference between a location
3735240	3737500	and the general term location.
3737500	3741860	That requires, that is determinate
3741860	3743220	and that means it's median.
3744860	3747580	You understand one thing via an object.
3747580	3748500	And it can't do that.
3748500	3752340	So it also can't have here in the content of what it knows.
3753420	3754260	Yes.
3754260	3755300	Doesn't the,
3757260	3759780	Colin, thinking of knowledge as a knowledgeable object
3759780	3764040	already presumed like a distinction between objects
3764040	3766260	rather than just being an object,
3766260	3768740	which to say now is night I feel
3768740	3771380	it's already kind of giving some certainty,
3771380	3774380	something that's uncertainty has already denounced.
3774380	3776660	Now is not, it just is, isn't it?
3776660	3777620	Exactly.
3777620	3781360	And that means that either,
3782580	3787420	so what you're really showing is
3789580	3791860	sense certainty shouldn't even be talking
3791860	3792820	about here and now.
3793660	3795500	It should just say, I know this.
3795500	3797980	Or if it wants to say here and now,
3799780	3804780	it should just refuse to look at any other objects
3804800	3805860	or at any other time.
3806980	3808520	That is to say, it should say,
3808520	3810580	what I know is this here now,
3810580	3814020	don't tell me about any other objects or at any other times.
3814020	3817220	I'm saying it shouldn't even recognize other objects.
3817220	3818960	It just exists.
3818960	3819800	Exactly.
3819800	3823000	So Hegel's going to modify sensuous certainty
3823000	3826160	to answer his own objection in the direction
3826160	3827200	that you're indicating.
3827200	3828040	Okay.
3828040	3828880	Yeah.
3828880	3833880	So this situation of I determines universal of no.
3838160	3842240	So now in time, so now as P1 or P2 or P3
3842240	3844840	is dependent on my situation.
3844840	3847960	Yeah, so Hegel's going to do exactly the same move
3847960	3850560	with I in one second.
3850560	3852760	Because I is also an index.
3853400	3855160	That is to say, in his terms, it's a universal.
3855160	3858240	We would think of it more naturally as an index.
3858240	3860400	But before we got there,
3860400	3862920	Hegel said something really important in 97.
3864680	3868460	We also express the sensuous as a universal,
3868460	3870500	but we say is this,
3870500	3872680	i.e. the universal this,
3872680	3875360	or we say it is, i.e. being as such.
3875360	3877320	Let's leave the being theme aside.
3877320	3880200	We thereby, of course, do not represent to ourselves
3880240	3883480	the universal, this for being as such,
3883480	3885720	but we express the universal.
3885720	3887760	Or in this sensuous certainty,
3887760	3890840	we do not at all say what we mean.
3892200	3893520	So there's a distinction,
3893520	3895880	this is totally central to sensuous certainty
3895880	3900880	between what we say and what we mean,
3902480	3905040	by which Hegel means what we intend to say.
3905840	3910840	So he's going to argue that what sensuous certainty
3910880	3915520	intends to mean is this particular piece of chalk.
3915520	3919640	But what it actually says is the universal this.
3921360	3924040	So it can't say what it means to say.
3925760	3929800	So what sensuous certainty is trying to do is express
3929800	3932520	that what it knows is particulars.
3933520	3937680	But with only this here and now, it can't do that.
3937680	3940360	Because Hegel will argue over the course of the chapter,
3940360	3944040	to know a particular, you have to have both
3945400	3947200	something like this here and now,
3947200	3950800	call it an indexical, call it an intuition,
3950800	3953920	and a conception of a universal.
3953920	3958000	You have to distinguish this from other particulars
3958000	3959400	in terms of its properties.
3960400	3964880	So sensuous certainty thinks of itself
3964880	3967760	that it knows individual particulars.
3967760	3971000	But what it says is, I know this,
3971000	3972480	and this is a universal.
3973440	3977480	Because that's this, that's this, that's this.
3977480	3979080	Everything's at this.
3979080	3982080	So if what it knows is this, it knows,
3984760	3985960	rather than this.
3986960	3987800	Yeah.
3987800	3990320	I'm confused because I thought we are not,
3990320	3993000	we're trying to not conceptualize in answering
3993000	3996560	for the sensuous certainty person.
3996560	4000640	But then we introduce the concept of a universal.
4000640	4004720	Wouldn't they just not conceptualize that?
4004720	4005560	Right.
4008560	4012720	So one background worry here is whether Hegel is
4013720	4017440	making sensuous certainty answer questions
4017440	4020160	that according to sensuous certainty's own concept
4020160	4022120	of itself, it doesn't have to.
4022120	4022960	Yeah.
4022960	4023800	Okay.
4028360	4030680	It's important to note that sensuous certainty
4030680	4033080	is not just mute.
4033080	4038080	It's not like, this is not caveman consciousness.
4038360	4042200	So it has a conception of itself of what it knows.
4042200	4046200	Now, it can conceptualize its knowledge
4046200	4048280	without thinking that what it knows
4048280	4049640	is a conceptualized object.
4050560	4053640	So in order, the whole setup is that we're examining
4053640	4055400	concepts of knowledge.
4055400	4058200	So sensuous certainty has to have a concept of itself.
4059720	4063760	But what it knows is the object,
4063760	4065480	and it knows it non-conceptually.
4066680	4069200	Which means the project of the phenomenology
4069200	4074200	is not to take each conception of knowledge and then ask,
4074400	4078320	does that, or each shape of consciousness
4078320	4079640	that has a conception of knowledge,
4079640	4081440	ask does that shape of consciousness
4081440	4084120	know its conception of knowledge?
4084120	4086480	That is to say, we don't take the concept of knowledge
4086480	4088040	and put it on the object side.
4088960	4091360	Because sensuous certainty would immediately fail that.
4091360	4094320	Because a concept of knowledge is conceptual.
4094320	4096320	So sensuous certainty doesn't think it knows
4096320	4097720	its concept of knowledge.
4097720	4100040	That's just what it says if you ask it.
4100040	4101680	What I know is this.
4101680	4103280	But your concept of knowledge is not a this,
4103320	4105760	yeah, yeah, yeah, epistemology is kind of bullshit.
4106760	4108320	It's not something that it knows.
4108320	4109640	It's just how it answers.
4109640	4111280	It's how it conceives of this.
4111280	4113080	And so it would be cheating, it would be cheap
4113080	4115080	if we were like, well, you don't know that.
4115080	4118000	It's supposed to be not cheating if what we say is,
4118000	4121200	that immediate knowledge isn't knowledge of that object.
4121200	4123360	It's not the object that you intend to know,
4123360	4124640	the object that you mean.
4124640	4127080	The object that you say is something different.
4127080	4127920	Yeah?
4127920	4131120	Well, why not start with the caveman consciousness?
4131120	4133800	Well, because it's really hard to argue with caveman, right?
4135240	4136960	The epistemological version of,
4136960	4139600	oh, I'm just a caveman lawyer, right?
4139600	4141520	I, that was just a gesture and a joke.
4141520	4144400	I didn't really know what I needed to tell you that through.
4144400	4149400	Yeah, because caveman consciousness
4152000	4152840	sort of,
4156840	4160040	by definition, doesn't have the conception of itself as knowledge.
4161280	4166280	Okay, and that might mean, so background question,
4166400	4171400	is Hegel assuming something to the effect that if you know,
4171400	4173320	maybe you don't know you know,
4173320	4176760	but you can coherently conceptualize your knowledge
4176760	4180560	in a way that survives imminent dialectical critique?
4180560	4183200	I think he is, potentially.
4183200	4188200	Okay, so we've talked about 97 and 98, time check.
4189200	4194200	Let's take a 10 minute break.
4205080	4209240	Consciousness, Hegel has raised these problems
4209240	4210400	for sensuous certainty.
4213080	4216280	Here and now are universals.
4218200	4221400	Therefore, either what sensuous certainty knows
4221400	4223280	is the universal this,
4223280	4225120	which applies to absolutely everything.
4226560	4231560	Or, insofar as it wants to know this,
4232120	4235240	it can't use here or now to figure it out.
4235240	4239600	Okay, now sensuous certainty modifies itself.
4239600	4242880	And it modifies itself in the direction
4242880	4244640	of making itself the essence.
4245480	4248560	Now what that means is, it says,
4248560	4253000	okay, I determine what this is,
4253000	4256520	because what is here or what is now,
4256520	4259280	or what is this, is what is,
4260840	4264200	it is where I am, and when I am, and what I'm pointing to.
4265480	4269120	So it tries to solve this problem of this here now
4269120	4272880	by anchoring the reference of this here and now to the I.
4272920	4276200	So I could write those out, those indexical expressions,
4276200	4279280	indexical clauses, using I, but I won't bother,
4279280	4281760	because we can all see what the problem is gonna be.
4281760	4286760	The problem is going to be that I itself is an indexical.
4287600	4292600	I, as uttered by any subject S, refers to S.
4293480	4297000	So Hegel will say I is a universal.
4297000	4301840	I refers indifferently to every subject that can say I.
4303320	4306760	Or, if we take the more contemporary conception
4306760	4308320	on which it's an indexical,
4309360	4314360	that cannot be within the content of what consciousness knows.
4314680	4318480	Consciousness is explanation of how it knows its object
4318480	4319760	cannot go by universals.
4321360	4326040	So now Hegel says that this is the bottom of 102,
4326040	4329800	oh he's saying 101, this just expresses this idea
4329800	4332480	of tying, of using the I to anchor
4332480	4334880	the reference of here and now.
4334880	4336960	Now is daytime, because I see it.
4336960	4339320	Here is a tree for precisely the same reason,
4339320	4341080	however sensuous certainty experiences
4341080	4343520	in these relationships, the same dialectic
4343520	4345760	as it did within the preceding relationships.
4345760	4349240	I, this, see the tree and assert the tree to be tree,
4349240	4350800	to be here.
4350800	4352760	Now, properly speaking, it doesn't assert anything
4352760	4354400	to be here, that's 8%.
4354400	4356240	However, another I sees the house
4356240	4359360	and asserts that there is no tree here, but rather a house.
4359360	4361480	Both truths have the same warrants,
4361480	4363840	namely the immediacy of seeing and the surety
4363840	4366320	and the seerons, which both have about their knowing,
4366320	4368840	however one vanishes into the other.
4368840	4372400	So I see a house, Christa sees a tree,
4372400	4374520	I see a house, I see a tree.
4379200	4381080	They can't both be right.
4381080	4384320	And sensuous certainty, or let's see, I see a tree,
4384320	4387960	I see a non-tree, or I don't see a tree.
4388800	4390320	They can't both be right,
4390320	4393000	and sensuous certainty doesn't have the means
4393000	4395680	to distinguish the two in the way we would by saying,
4395680	4398760	when I say I see a tree, it means Nick Stang sees a tree.
4398760	4401000	And when Christa says I see a non-tree,
4401000	4402560	it means Christa sees a tree,
4402560	4404800	because that would involve having the distinction
4404800	4408240	between the universal, one who can say I,
4408240	4410640	and particular people who can say I.
4410640	4413480	Okay, 102, the beginning of 102,
4413480	4415880	I've already explained what's going on.
4415880	4418760	So then at the very bottom of page 63,
4418760	4421120	however much this demand is set before science
4421120	4422880	as its touchstone,
4422880	4425160	a demand which it would surely not last out,
4425160	4427880	namely the deduce, construct, find a priori,
4427880	4429960	however one wishes to express it,
4429960	4432760	a so-called this thing, or this person,
4432760	4435520	still it is reasonable that the demand should state
4435520	4438000	which of the many things this thing,
4438000	4440680	or which of the eyes this I means,
4440680	4442840	but it is impossible to state this.
4442840	4445840	So sensuous certainty says,
4445840	4447920	what it knows is this here now,
4447920	4450680	but it cannot, compatible with its own shape or consciousness,
4450680	4452960	say which thing it knows.
4454520	4456680	And so either it knows the universal,
4456680	4459160	which is what it says, but it doesn't want to say that,
4459160	4460720	it doesn't mean to say that,
4460720	4462880	or it needs to be modified.
4463880	4467520	Okay, 103, sensuous certainty therefore learns
4467520	4470640	from experience in the technical Hegelian sense
4470640	4474080	that its essence is neither in the object nor in the eye,
4474080	4476720	and in the immediacy is in immediacy
4476720	4479600	of neither one or the other of them.
4479600	4483000	For in both, what I mean is instead what is inessential,
4483000	4484760	and the object and eye are universals
4484760	4486280	in which the now and the human eye
4486280	4488680	that me and do not endure are not.
4488680	4491360	So it's tried making the object be essential,
4491360	4493280	a thing that determines what knowing is,
4493280	4497480	it's tried making itself the essential
4497480	4500400	by using it to anchor the reference of here and now,
4500760	4502120	neither worked.
4502120	4505200	We thereby come to posit the whole of sensuous certainty
4505200	4507320	itself as its essence,
4507320	4509920	and no longer only as a moment of sensuous certainty
4509920	4511600	as happened in both cases,
4511600	4513200	in which at first the object approaches the eye,
4513200	4514680	and the eye itself reaches supposed to be
4514680	4516320	the reality of sensuous certainty.
4516320	4519080	It is thus only the whole of sensuous certainty itself,
4519080	4521240	which links tenaciously in such sensuous certainty
4521240	4523800	to immediacy, in which thereby excludes from itself
4523800	4526240	all the opposition that took place in what proceeding.
4526240	4527400	So sensuous certainty realizes,
4527400	4530120	okay, I tried making the object the essence,
4530120	4532000	I tried making myself the essence, neither worked.
4532000	4533640	So you need to think of it,
4533640	4534960	they're both essential or neither.
4534960	4538320	I'm not gonna talk about essence anymore.
4538320	4541320	So I'm just gonna take sensuous certainty itself.
4541320	4544840	This situation of I know this,
4544840	4546560	that's gonna be the whole thing.
4546560	4549200	This pure immediacy therefore no longer has any concern
4549200	4551520	with the otherness of the here as a tree,
4551520	4553360	which is a here that is a non-tree,
4553360	4555640	nor with the otherness of now as daytime,
4555640	4557840	and which passes over into a now that is night,
4557840	4558800	nor with another eye,
4558800	4560720	for which something other is the object.
4560720	4563240	So this new shape of self-consciousness,
4563240	4566080	new shape of self-censored certainty claims,
4566080	4569600	look, I know this, and if you raise any objections
4569600	4572760	about trees or houses, things I don't know now,
4572760	4575280	that isn't this, I'm going to ignore you.
4575280	4578800	Or you could think of this as episodic sensuous certainty.
4578800	4583200	This sensuous certainty knows this, now it knows this.
4583200	4587720	And if you ask it, but now is the water bottle,
4588600	4591000	now is the pencil is no longer true,
4591000	4592760	what are you talking about?
4592760	4594560	So now it's immunized itself
4594560	4596560	against all of these Hegelian objections.
4597480	4599760	So really these earlier Hegelian objections
4599760	4604320	were just moves to get you to see the logic of the game.
4604320	4606560	Because this is where sensuous certainty
4606560	4608120	should have started from.
4608120	4612120	Because all of these problems that were brought in
4612120	4613880	were really properly speaking things
4613880	4616000	that sensuous certainty never claimed to them.
4616000	4618640	Objects that weren't sensuously present to them,
4618640	4622080	like the tree when it was only perceiving the house,
4622080	4623720	weren't only sensing the house.
4623720	4626880	Like the daytime when now is night.
4626880	4628440	And other eyes.
4628440	4630760	So now sensuous certainty doesn't want to hear anything
4630760	4632560	about a house when it's looking at a tree.
4632560	4634400	It doesn't want to hear anything about daytime
4634400	4635240	when it's night.
4635240	4636800	And it doesn't want to hear anything about eyes.
4636800	4638840	And if you raise that, it's going to tell you,
4638840	4640080	I don't know what you're talking about.
4640080	4642240	None of that's knowledge, that's all bullshit.
4642240	4643780	Don't.
4643780	4644900	I just have one question.
4644900	4647460	Is it maybe even when we're talking about something
4647460	4650060	like this thing, you could call it an object?
4650060	4655820	Or is it more just like a bundle of sense data or something?
4655820	4658660	Bundle of sense data already brings in too much.
4658660	4663220	And object is a super, super general notion.
4663220	4666180	It's literally just the accusative.
4666180	4671580	That is to say, it's what consciousness is of.
4671580	4673460	Whenever there's of-ness, there's an object.
4674420	4677180	However much you use the word object, but OK.
4677180	4680420	So at this stage, we're at the real caveman consciousness?
4680420	4683460	Except that, unlike the caveman,
4683460	4686660	it has a conception of its known.
4686660	4688040	Otherwise, the whole project wouldn't go on.
4688040	4689240	You cannot argue with cavemen.
4689240	4691580	I mean, probably you could argue with cavemen.
4691580	4694140	There's a great book about how it's called
4694140	4697060	The Dawn of Everything by Ray Rundland Groud.
4697060	4698620	And the basic idea is we all think
4698620	4703420	of a prehistoric, so-called hunter-gatherer,
4703420	4708660	societies as really boring and life-having soft.
4708660	4712100	But actually, it was probably way better.
4712100	4715100	It's just talking about consciousness
4715100	4718380	or the sense of certain telling us something.
4718380	4721020	I just wonder, because in this book,
4721020	4724580	there's a concept called cognitive impenetrability.
4724580	4728420	It says that in perception, it just perception itself.
4728620	4729980	It doesn't tell us anything.
4729980	4734780	But some people also argue that we can actually
4734780	4738260	perceive some high-order property in things,
4738260	4741300	for example, like unity, identity, and so on.
4741300	4744940	Yeah, so this conception, this model of consciousness
4744940	4748820	is several levels more primitive than anything
4748820	4751060	you would find in contemporary analytic philosophy
4751060	4752620	or cognitive science.
4752620	4754940	Because this has not been developed
4754940	4757660	because it's plausible as an account of consciousness
4757900	4759780	or because it's something that emerges naturally
4759780	4761300	from the sciences.
4761300	4766300	It's been introduced purely to get the project started.
4772740	4776580	This is way more primitive than any conception
4776580	4779340	of perceptual consciousness that you will find
4779340	4781380	in contemporary literature.
4781380	4782660	Let's just read a little bit further.
4782660	4785460	This pure immediacy, therefore, no longer has any concern
4785460	4787460	with the otherness of the here as a tree,
4787580	4788780	which is a here that is a non-tree,
4788780	4790260	nor the otherness of now is daytime,
4790260	4792060	which passes over into a now that is night,
4792060	4794860	nor with another eye, for which something other is the object.
4794860	4798180	Its truth is preserved as a self-consistent relation,
4798180	4800100	which makes no difference of essentiality
4800100	4803140	and non-essentiality between the eye and the object,
4803140	4805020	and into which, therefore, no difference at all
4805020	4806260	can force its entry.
4806260	4809480	I, this eye, assert therefore that here is a tree.
4809480	4812660	Once again, shouldn't say is a tree, just here.
4812660	4813500	Happens to be a tree.
4813500	4814980	And it's not the case that I turn around
4814980	4817020	so that the here would become for me not a tree,
4817060	4818500	or that I myself, at another time,
4818500	4819980	take the here not to be a tree,
4819980	4821480	the now not to be the daytime.
4821480	4823380	Rather, I am pure intuitive,
4823380	4826220	and I stick with, namely, that now is daytime,
4826220	4828580	or else I also stick with here is a tree.
4828580	4830880	I also do not compare the here and the now themselves
4830880	4831720	with each other.
4831720	4834220	Rather, I cling tenaciously to an immediate relation.
4834220	4835380	Now it is daytime.
4835380	4839480	So any of these previous or past experiences,
4839480	4841280	any other objects in the environment,
4841280	4844300	any other subjects are now just being completely left out
4844300	4848060	by sensuous certainty as objects of knowledge.
4848060	4851480	Since the certainty itself no longer wishes to step forward
4851480	4853340	when we draw its attention to a now that is night,
4853340	4854720	or to an eye for which it is night,
4854720	4856940	we step up to it and let ourselves point
4856940	4858380	to the now that is a certainty.
4858380	4860300	So this angles, the metaphor is supposed to be,
4860300	4863340	we now take up the standpoint of sensuous certainty.
4863340	4866300	We look out from the eyes of sensuous certainty.
4867500	4870060	Thus we must enter into the same point of time or space,
4870060	4871260	point it out to ourselves,
4871260	4873540	allow ourselves to be made into the same eye
4873700	4875340	as that is a knowing uncertainty.
4875340	4877960	Let us see therefore how what is immediate,
4877960	4880900	which is pointed out to us is composed.
4880900	4883700	Okay, so now Hegel first makes the point
4883700	4887780	that he's going to make in 106 and 107 about time.
4887780	4888820	And because it's about time,
4888820	4890760	it's a little bit more complicated.
4890760	4892300	But I'll just say it about time,
4892300	4893660	you'll get the basic structure of it,
4893660	4895900	and then we'll talk about space.
4895900	4898980	So he first makes it about now, then he makes it about here.
4898980	4901880	So the point about now is that I say,
4901880	4905140	what I know is this here now,
4906800	4909480	saying that takes a certain amount of time.
4910560	4913440	And I haven't said it until I've said all of it.
4914920	4917420	But by the time I've said it,
4917420	4919020	what I intended to say,
4920260	4923440	the object that I intended to say that I know
4923440	4926240	the beginning of that no longer is.
4927200	4930840	Because if it did, if the object persisted,
4930880	4933080	it would be a universal.
4933080	4935520	It would be a thing that's one over many.
4935520	4938160	Not a property, but a thing that can exist
4938160	4939800	at different times.
4939800	4942520	And so for consciousness,
4942520	4945960	to be able to give an account of why this here now
4946960	4950520	refers either to the first moment of the thing,
4950520	4952600	or the whole life of the thing,
4952600	4955280	it would be able to have to distinguish
4955280	4956760	the thing as a universal,
4956760	4958520	or a thing that endures through time
4958560	4961520	from its various moments of time.
4961520	4964000	And that requires mediation.
4964000	4966880	That requires a distinction among things.
4966880	4970160	And that is not something that such a certain can know.
4971800	4973060	So the idea is,
4974480	4975720	time is not,
4977160	4978960	there's more than one moment of time.
4980040	4983760	So Hegel's just assuming there's more than one moment of time.
4983760	4987280	Thinking the thought, what I know is this here now,
4987280	4990640	or what I know is this now, takes some time.
4992020	4995120	You haven't finished it until all that time has passed.
4996420	5001420	But the object, the moment of time that began,
5002120	5004680	no longer is, so either you're no longer able
5004680	5006880	to refer to that moment of time,
5006880	5010160	or you're referring to a thing that persists through time,
5010160	5012720	and that requires mediation.
5012720	5014520	That requires the idea of a thing
5014520	5016560	that exists at different times.
5018240	5020800	Is Hegel also assuming time is infinitely divisible?
5020800	5023600	I don't think he's assuming it's infinitely divisible.
5024560	5027280	I think he's assuming it's divisible.
5028160	5031200	But he might be assuming it's infinitely divisible.
5031200	5034100	The most he's assuming is that it's orbital.
5034100	5035400	He's infinitely divisible.
5035400	5037040	He's not assuming it's infinitely divided.
5037040	5041080	That is to say, there's always a smaller interval of time.
5041080	5042320	So that's the time point.
5043320	5044320	More complicated.
5044320	5046440	The here point is much simpler.
5047920	5049560	So 108.
5049560	5051040	The here that has been pointed out
5051040	5054320	and to which I cling is likewise a this here,
5054320	5057000	which is in fact not this here,
5057000	5059280	but is rather an in front of and behind
5059280	5061640	or an above and below or a right and left.
5062560	5066880	So I refer to something that is spatially complex.
5066880	5068460	That is to say, has parts.
5069380	5071960	The here, which is supposed to be pointed out,
5071960	5075520	vanishes into another here, but that one likewise vanishes.
5076520	5081520	That is to say, here could refer,
5081680	5086280	if I say here, that could refer to the whole object
5086280	5088040	or refer to any of its parts.
5089880	5092440	What is pointed out, held onto and which endures
5092440	5096160	is a negative this, which only is as the here's are taken
5096160	5098640	as they're supposed to be, but which in being so taken
5098640	5100000	have sublated themselves.
5101560	5103400	It is a simple summary of many years.
5103400	5105240	Why did you guys do this to yourself?
5105600	5109160	You could have taken bioethics instead you're reading this.
5109160	5112800	Okay, so what he means by that is
5115720	5118880	so he's assuming that physical objects
5118880	5123380	are spatially extended, so they have parts.
5123380	5125280	The thing that sensuous surgery knows
5125280	5127720	is a spatially complex object with parts.
5129960	5133500	And that means that it's spatially universal.
5133540	5136180	That is to say, it's in all of these parts.
5137940	5141900	Which means that to be conscious of it
5141900	5146440	as opposed to any of its parts requires mediation.
5146440	5149740	So why would I say this here, this here now,
5149740	5153220	am I referring to the whole book rather than its parts?
5153220	5157180	The only thing that could explain why my consciousness
5157180	5161140	is of this whole book rather than its parts
5161140	5165580	is because I'm aware of it as a book with parts
5165580	5167560	rather than as the parts.
5167560	5171460	I have to consciously separate it from its background,
5171460	5173340	from its environment, and from its parts
5173340	5176620	to be conscious of it as the whole object it is.
5176620	5179260	The same problem applies if I want to be conscious
5179260	5181380	of the page as opposed to the whole book,
5181380	5184900	I have to be conscious of the page rather than the book.
5184900	5189900	And that requires negation and that's a form of determinacy
5190020	5191500	which is a form of mediation.
5191500	5193900	And that is not allowed by essentially certainty.
5196400	5199700	The here that is meant would be the point.
5199700	5202780	However, the point is not, but rather as the point
5202780	5205060	is demonstrated as existing, the demonstrating points
5205060	5207260	to itself as showing itself to be not immediate knowing
5207260	5209180	but instead of movement from out of the many years
5209180	5210900	which we meant into the universal here,
5210900	5212420	which is a simple plurality of years
5212420	5214900	in the way that the daytime is a simple plurality of that.
5214900	5215740	What does that mean?
5215740	5218980	What that means is Hegel admits the existence
5219020	5222060	of spatial points, but they have their being
5223380	5227900	in being the intersection of lines,
5227900	5231700	which have their being in being the intersection of planes,
5231700	5234620	which have their being in being the intersection of solids.
5234620	5237940	That is to say, to be conscious of a point
5239220	5241900	is mediated by consciousness of the line
5241900	5243780	that intersects at that point.
5243780	5246800	So consciousness of a point is totally okay,
5246800	5249360	but it's immediate.
5249360	5250960	Okay, now what is Hegel assuming
5250960	5252880	about the composition of space here?
5252880	5257880	He's assuming that it is infinitely divisible
5260640	5262640	because if there were,
5264840	5267720	he seems to be assuming that it's infinitely divisible.
5267720	5269240	I'd have to think about whether this argument
5269240	5271000	could work without that assumption,
5271000	5272480	but he does seem to be assuming that.
5272480	5273320	Okay.
5274320	5277880	Okay, so the idea is sensuous certainty says,
5277880	5280560	okay, look, forget all these other objects.
5280560	5282040	All I know is this here now,
5283220	5287640	but now why is its consciousness of the whole pencil
5288520	5289960	rather than the tip of the pencil,
5289960	5290960	the upper half of the pencil,
5290960	5292560	the lower half of the pencil,
5292560	5294960	the color of the pencil, et cetera?
5294960	5297280	The only thing that it could do that
5297280	5299320	is because it's conscious of this thing
5299320	5300680	as a unity of parts,
5301560	5306560	which means it has to have a conception of the whole
5307480	5309000	as opposed to the parts.
5310400	5311520	That's just to say,
5311520	5316520	it has to have mediacy within the content of its consciousness.
5321200	5323120	Okay, so now to go back to this,
5323120	5326040	so one of the classic worries
5326040	5330120	about Hegel's critique of sensuous certainty
5330240	5333440	is that he's putting in sensuous certainty
5333440	5335720	the amount of things that sensuous certainty
5335720	5337300	doesn't have to say.
5337300	5339800	This is Zopan's question about,
5339800	5341960	it's caveman consciousness.
5341960	5345720	Now, if sensuous certainty was literally just mute,
5346620	5348840	like staring at things,
5348840	5350880	without any conception of itself as knowing,
5350880	5353320	obviously Hegel's critique would not be imminent,
5354360	5356200	but that just means that that can't possibly
5356200	5358280	be the project of the world.
5358760	5363440	So a shape of consciousness is a shape of consciousness.
5363440	5364520	That is to say,
5364520	5367060	it's something that has a conception of itself
5367060	5368880	as relating to an object.
5368880	5371720	That means it has to have a conception
5371720	5375920	of why its consciousness is a consciousness of its object.
5378640	5383160	And Hegel is assuming that the consciousness
5383160	5387920	of the sensuous certainty's consciousness of its object,
5387920	5391520	if that consciousness is not conceptually mediated,
5391520	5396520	can't be a consciousness of a whole thing apart.
5400200	5404480	Can you just explain what exactly the sensuous certainty
5404480	5407880	person can afford to distinguish without concepts?
5407880	5409360	Is it between particulars,
5409360	5412120	or is it between the concept of a universal
5412120	5414760	and that of a particular?
5414760	5416640	So what it can say,
5416680	5419840	so we're allowing it to say things in answer to us,
5419840	5420920	which involves concepts,
5422240	5425120	but what it can know involves no concepts.
5427320	5429120	In sorry, it involves no universals.
5430480	5432480	All it knows is this here now.
5436160	5440560	So he tries to avoid Hegel's critique
5440560	5443160	by claiming that this here now is not a universal
5443160	5445040	because it doesn't care about the other instances,
5445040	5446360	it just cares about this.
5447240	5449280	But Hegel's point is that even this,
5449280	5451160	being conscious of this,
5451160	5453200	requires consciousness of a universal.
5453200	5456320	It requires a consciousness of a one over man.
5456320	5458240	And that means it requires consciousness
5458240	5460520	of the one as being distinct from them,
5460520	5464600	which is determinism, and that's a kind of mediation.
5466600	5469320	Now, let's go a little bit further.
5472240	5475560	109, it is clear both that the dialectic
5475600	5479760	of sensuous certainty is nothing but the simple history
5479760	5483040	of its movement that is its experience.
5483040	5486240	So the dialectic of sensuous certainty
5486240	5490800	is just this sequence of experiences,
5490800	5495800	which is to say its awareness of apparent contradictions
5496600	5499720	between its consciousness of the object and the object
5499720	5501440	and attempts to resolve them.
5501440	5503640	And that sensuous certainty itself is nothing
5503640	5505360	but just this history.
5505480	5507280	So the shape of consciousness,
5507280	5510960	Hegel's now identifying with its own experience.
5510960	5512600	Or sensuous certainty is,
5512600	5514440	this is not something happening to sensuous certainty
5514440	5517160	on that side, we're not doing anything to sensuous certainty.
5517160	5520000	Sensuous certainty, just purely the concept
5520000	5522920	of sensuous certainty when thought thread
5522920	5524680	generates these problems.
5524680	5528200	For that reason, natural consciousness also proceeds
5528200	5531800	to this result, what is the true in sensuous certainty
5531800	5533920	to keep pressing the other forward.
5533920	5536280	It learns from experience about it,
5536280	5538560	but then it likewise forgets it,
5538560	5540880	and then it starts the whole movement all over again
5540880	5542360	right from the beginning.
5542360	5543760	It is thus a bit astonishing
5543760	5545600	when in the face of this experience,
5545600	5547640	it is set up as a philosophical assertion,
5547640	5549320	whereas a universal experience,
5549320	5551320	or even as the outcome of skepticism,
5551320	5554960	that the reality or the being of external things as this
5554960	5559760	or as sensuous is to have absolute truth for consciousness.
5559760	5564760	Such an assertion does not say at,
5564760	5567600	does not say at the same, does not at the same time
5567600	5569160	know what it is saying.
5569160	5570920	It does not know what it is saying,
5570920	5573520	the opposite of what it wants to say.
5573520	5576040	So sensuous certainty wants to say
5576040	5578920	that the object of consciousness is the pencil
5578920	5582600	in saying, all I know is this.
5582600	5585840	But actually, this is a universal.
5585840	5589160	In fact, this is the most abstract universal,
5589160	5591440	because everything is a this.
5591440	5594720	So now, let me turn to the theme
5597440	5599960	that I said I would talk about, which is being.
5603600	5608600	So sensuous certainty's official view is I know this.
5614560	5617440	Now Hegel sometimes says what it knows is,
5617440	5622440	I know this is, but that makes the object of consciousness
5624160	5626400	complex, that is to say there's a difference
5626400	5629240	between the subject and the predicate.
5629240	5630560	You can't have that.
5630560	5633000	So we're properly speaking, what it knows is this.
5635920	5640480	But we can also just characterize that object as it.
5640480	5644120	What it knows is it, or being.
5645120	5650680	Now the object of consciousness has to be completely immediate.
5653920	5660120	Immediacy goes with indeterminacy.
5660120	5661760	Why?
5661760	5670920	Because immediacy is the same or goes with determinacy.
5670920	5672680	If something is determinate, it's
5672680	5674680	one thing rather than another, it
5674680	5678720	is what it is in virtue of what it is not.
5678720	5683920	So if something has a determinate color, it's red.
5683920	5688400	It's red in virtue of not being blue.
5688400	5691240	Likewise, if something is mediated,
5691240	5693320	it has to be mediated by something else.
5693320	5696480	So it has to be determinately, not that.
5696480	5699120	Now, there is this thing called self-mediation in Hegel.
5699120	5700920	Something can mediate itself.
5700920	5703680	But then there's a difference, there's
5703680	5708280	determinacy between the role of the thing as mediator
5708280	5710600	and the very same thing as mediator.
5710600	5712080	So wherever there's mediation, there's
5712080	5714840	determinacy, wherever there's determinacy, there's mediator.
5714840	5719600	So wherever there's lack of mediacy,
5719600	5722320	wherever there's immediacy, there's indeterminacy.
5722320	5726000	So what if I know is this and it's immediate,
5726000	5728120	it's an indeterminate this.
5728120	5730000	Now, this is all stuff that we are saying.
5730080	5732680	This is not something that consciousness gets at.
5732680	5736320	This is for us, not for some sensuous certainty.
5736320	5740440	What I know is the indeterminate this.
5740440	5742840	So what sensuous certainty is saying
5742840	5746880	is I know this, which is not just the cosmos.
5746880	5749000	Because the cosmos is a determinate this.
5749000	5752960	It's the most indeterminate possible this.
5752960	5755840	Another way of putting that is what consciousness knows
5755840	5759520	is not this determinate being, but completely indeterminate
5759880	5761240	being.
5761240	5767360	What it knows is being, pure being.
5767360	5768840	OK.
5768840	5771560	That means there's a structural parallel,
5771560	5773760	this is just to anticipate a couple of things,
5773760	5775760	between sensuous certainty and the beginning
5775760	5778280	of the science of logic.
5778280	5780600	The beginning of the first category of the science
5780600	5782480	of logic is pure being.
5782480	5783120	OK.
5783120	5785520	Now, question.
5785520	5788800	I myself am not really sure what I want to say about this.
5789800	5793240	So Hegel draws a distinction between what sensuous certainty
5793240	5796960	says and what it means.
5796960	5801680	What it says it knows is pure being,
5801680	5804440	completely indeterminate being.
5804440	5807600	You take away all immediacy, you take all way determinacy.
5807600	5810920	It's not that I know this being, because this being is
5810920	5813680	this being, a virtue of not being, some other being.
5813680	5817520	It's a determinate being, or a specific being,
5817520	5819880	mediated by some other being.
5819880	5821520	So completely immediate being, which
5821520	5825280	is the absolutely pure, general being.
5825280	5827560	Not just not even God, because God is traditionally
5827560	5829920	conceived of as a being, a very special being,
5829920	5833200	but one being among others, just pure being.
5833200	5835320	So what Hegel says is sensuous certainty
5835320	5837960	says what it knows is pure being.
5837960	5844040	But what it means is it knows this being, this particular
5844040	5844520	being.
5844520	5851240	And so this contrast, this conflict,
5851240	5855120	shows that this form of consciousness is incoherent.
5855120	5858800	But you could argue on behalf of sensuous certainty.
5858800	5860600	No.
5860600	5862560	What you've shown is that sensuous certainty
5862560	5864960	knows pure being.
5864960	5866760	Now, I'm not sure what to do with that.
5869760	5873000	And I want to leave this open, because one
5873000	5874880	of the big problems in the science of logic
5874880	5878680	is why, what entitles us to go beyond pure being?
5878680	5881880	So why can't sensuous, why isn't Hegel just proven
5881880	5886480	that what knowing is is the knowing of pure being?
5886480	5887720	Done.
5887720	5889280	Book ends.
5889280	5899240	Now, one thing that Hegel could say is, look,
5899240	5902480	it might be that knowing is just the pure knowing
5902480	5903840	of pure being.
5903840	5906760	But that's not sensuous.
5906760	5909000	Whatever your access to pure being is,
5909000	5911000	it's not through the senses.
5911000	5917800	So that definitely is not what sensuous certainty means to me.
5917800	5920520	It may be what it says, but it doesn't mean to me.
5920520	5922240	So I just want to flag that.
5922240	5926840	So this distinction between what sensuous certainty says
5926840	5929800	and what it means.
5929800	5934440	So first of all, general irony of the phenomenology.
5934440	5936800	What is for consciousness is not always
5936800	5938320	the same as what is for us.
5938320	5942200	So certain things will seem a certain way to consciousness,
5942200	5946840	but the observer can see that it's not that way.
5946840	5948960	Irony is when the apparent meaning
5948960	5950760	is different from the actual meaning.
5950760	5955600	So Oedipus is like, why is there this plague affecting Athens?
5955600	5957400	Someone must have cured it in some terrible crime.
5957400	5958200	I wonder who it is.
5958200	5960480	And we're like, we all know why.
5960480	5963160	So likewise, there's an irony here
5963160	5966240	in that sensuous certainty thinks
5966240	5971480	that what it knows is the super concrete sensuous particulars.
5971480	5975760	What it really knows is the most abstract thing of all, pure being.
5975760	5979240	Now, the other thing, there's a sort of historical irony here
5979240	5986840	in that there's a famous objection by this guy named
5986840	5992320	Krug to basically Hegel and all of his pals,
5992320	5995320	Fichte Schelling and Hegel, that these guys are just
5995320	5998480	talking about these complete abstractions.
5998480	6000480	This is all bullshit.
6000480	6003000	The this is bullshit reaction to German idealism
6003000	6004080	has an excellent pedigree.
6004080	6008240	The number one, the great advocate
6008240	6011680	of the this is bullshit reaction is Schopenhauer.
6011680	6015480	Unfortunately for Schopenhauer, his position is just Schelling's.
6015480	6018480	So Schelling is bullshit.
6021400	6024280	So when Krug says someplace, I can't remember where he says this.
6024280	6027560	He says, look, these guys talk about deducing all this stuff
6027560	6030840	from pure self-conscious, just the concept of knowing.
6030840	6032920	OK, I'll have you a challenge.
6032920	6035000	Deduce this pen.
6035000	6039360	So the idea is that in these systems of German idealism,
6039360	6042120	we never get to concrete particulars,
6042120	6046000	that somehow they've erased all particularity or singularity
6046000	6048360	in these super abstract notions.
6048360	6050320	So the other irony of such uncertainty
6050320	6056760	is Hegel is arguing that this, the thing that Krug
6056760	6058760	is demanding a deduction of, the thing that's
6058760	6062200	supposed to be the most concrete particular thing possible,
6062200	6063800	the German idealism could ever grasp
6063800	6068360	is, in fact, the most abstract, purely.
6068360	6070480	OK.
6070480	6074400	Let me just think for a moment how much more I actually
6074400	6079160	want to say.
6079160	6081120	OK, questions.
6081120	6082680	Yes.
6082680	6086280	I still kind of wonder how those questions tell you something.
6086280	6088840	It doesn't be like your perception itself
6088840	6089920	has already information.
6089920	6091560	It's not like three sides.
6091560	6094080	Or is it that I have this perception,
6094080	6097480	but what it says, what it tells, involves
6097480	6101840	some sort of inner tone, some kind of conceptualization.
6101840	6104280	So you're asking the question that's
6104280	6105840	not the question of phenomenology.
6105840	6109280	You're asking the question, what is perceptual experience?
6109280	6110680	The question of the phenomenology
6110680	6115200	is start with shapes of consciousness
6115200	6117480	and then undermine them internally.
6117480	6119440	So sensuous certainty, as I said before,
6119440	6123400	is not as complex as the thing you're taking into it.
6123400	6127280	It's a philosopher's construct.
6127280	6133040	It's just immediate sensuous apprehension of intent.
6133040	6137520	It means, in particular, what it says is a universal.
6137520	6139160	There were questions for you, Isaac.
6139160	6143360	Yeah, so is the pure being here, Mass Hegel poet,
6143360	6148960	is that somewhat similar to Heidegger's being or not?
6148960	6151480	So Tark and I taught a whole seminar about this.
6151480	6154000	And I'm not sure what conclusion we came to.
6154000	6163240	But there's no simple answer to that question.
6163240	6167680	And insofar as there is one, the answer has to be no.
6167680	6172320	Because being is what Dasein understands.
6172320	6175840	And pure being for Hegel has no relationship
6175840	6178000	to any particular being.
6178040	6179720	It has to be more general than that.
6179720	6181120	Yeah.
6181120	6185320	So if subject is purely receptive,
6185320	6192480	how do we know the object that we perceive for first time?
6192480	6197680	Once again, for sensuous certainty,
6197680	6202360	knowing an object just is apprehending it.
6202360	6203960	So when you see it for the first time,
6203960	6206280	you know it as well as you will ever know it,
6206280	6207800	as well as you know anything.
6207880	6209680	For the first time, for the second time,
6209680	6213560	those are only relevant if knowledge is something more
6213560	6216040	than just apprehending something.
6216040	6219760	More than just, I mean, and sensuous certainty
6219760	6222280	has a, when I say apprehension, has a superminable notion
6222280	6223520	of apprehension.
6223520	6225760	It's not even the Kantian thing where in apprehension,
6225760	6226800	you have to combine some.
6226800	6228720	It's just like, boom, it's before you.
6228720	6238200	The assumption or the premise implicit in your question
6238200	6242400	that we know something less well the first time than later,
6242400	6245920	assume that knowledge is a matter
6245920	6248360	of accumulating information about something
6248360	6250040	through further acquaintance with it.
6250040	6252720	But that is not sense certainty's conception
6252720	6254200	of what knowledge is.
6254200	6255920	Sense certainty's conception of knowledge
6255920	6264760	is in some ways, the more unfamiliar the thing is,
6264760	6265840	the better.
6265840	6267640	Because if it's unfamiliar, you're
6267640	6269960	just going to be like, what is this?
6269960	6275480	The first time you see a pencil, you don't know it any better
6275480	6276720	or any worse.
6276720	6280200	So the subject comes through object?
6280200	6281160	No.
6281160	6287120	The subject is immediately sensibly aware of that.
6287120	6288320	Yeah.
6288320	6295240	So another question is that, is what conscience means
6295240	6297840	identifiable to poor consciousness
6297840	6302480	and what you says identify or is in a cell,
6302480	6304800	is that identifiable or not really there
6304800	6308320	to distinct separate, distinct distinct?
6308360	6311560	I mean, insofar as there's a distinction emerges
6311560	6317880	between what it says and what it means,
6317880	6325520	that has to become for consciousness.
6325520	6328240	Otherwise, it wouldn't be a problem.
6328240	6332120	All the problems have to be problems that eventually
6332120	6334000	become for consciousness.
6334000	6337000	Even if when Hegel originally introduces them,
6337000	6339920	they're not yet for consciousness but merely for us.
6339920	6345720	But is what he says identifiable in the cell more like poor?
6345720	6349520	But what it says, like I said, I don't think
6349520	6352120	it should be identifiable with it.
6352120	6352600	Yeah.
6352600	6353960	Devanj?
6353960	6356400	What does he mean when he says sublate?
6356400	6356920	Oh, OK.
6356920	6359640	I was hoping someone would not ask me that question.
6359640	6362120	And the reason is, I think, so it's totally
6362120	6363360	a central in Hegel.
6363360	6366440	I just think it's easier to understand in the logic
6366520	6369040	because he has a whole discussion of it in the logic.
6369040	6372680	So the word in German is aufheben.
6372680	6377560	Now, aufheben, which is a separable prefix for those of you
6377560	6382840	who are taking German, has two totally different meanings
6382840	6383960	in German.
6383960	6387960	It means both to lift something up, you have this aufgehogen.
6387960	6390080	It also means to cancel something.
6390080	6394040	So if you suspend a law, you've heben this auf.
6394040	6396120	So Hegel loves the fact that there's
6396120	6400400	this word that means two completely different things.
6400400	6403600	Now, what he means by it is something
6403600	6407920	is sublated aufgehogen.
6407920	6412400	The verb is aufgehben, but the past part is it's aufgehogen.
6415400	6418760	It's to sublate.
6418760	6420120	This is sublated.
6425040	6426680	OK.
6426680	6433280	So something is sublated when it is canceled but preserved
6433280	6435400	at a higher logical level.
6435400	6437440	Now, what does that mean?
6437440	6442960	What that means, we'll give you some sort of folk examples.
6442960	6448840	So Hegel likes to say that the British monarch is sublated
6448840	6451760	in the British Constitution because there's
6451760	6456320	no monarch, because Charles, whatever his name is,
6456320	6459200	your king, not mine.
6459200	6466240	I am a subject of no kings, has no power.
6466240	6471560	His ancestors would despise his current predicament.
6471560	6475360	But he's still there.
6475360	6478240	He's there in a transformed role.
6478240	6479800	So he's both there and not there.
6479800	6482000	OK, what does that mean?
6482000	6489160	I think the better, the way to really answer this
6489160	6489800	is in the logic.
6489800	6492280	I think it becomes much clearer in the logic.
6492280	6500280	But yeah.
6500280	6506120	So the idea of sublation is that when one shape of consciousness
6506120	6509720	undermines itself and gives rise to the next,
6509720	6513280	certain features of the first shape of consciousness
6513280	6516240	are present in the second shape of consciousness.
6516240	6518520	But they have a totally different meaning.
6518520	6520440	They're like the British monarch.
6520440	6524600	It's a monarch, but in nothing like the original sense.
6524600	6532000	It's both canceled and lifted in the back.
6532000	6532600	Yeah, sorry, sorry.
6532600	6533200	I keep missing you.
6533200	6533680	Sorry.
6533680	6535320	Yeah, your name.
6535320	6535800	Bowie.
6535800	6536280	Bowie.
6536280	6536800	OK.
6537400	6540880	I want to ask about 103, 104, and 105.
6540880	6541400	That's a lot.
6541400	6542240	No, no, no.
6542240	6545440	But just basically, what does Hegel mean
6545440	6549000	when he says that the whole of the century's consciousness
6549000	6550240	is its own essence?
6550240	6553640	Because when he talks about I being its own essence,
6553640	6555240	I mean, being the essence of the century,
6555240	6559120	certainly he means that, oh, when I say now, it's my now.
6559120	6561200	But what does it mean for the whole of the century?
6561200	6564840	So essence is an essentially contrasted concept.
6564840	6566720	It's like being special.
6566720	6570560	If everyone is special, no one is special.
6570560	6574960	So if both moments of such uncertainty are the essence,
6574960	6577360	then there's certainly neither of them.
6577360	6579920	So what that means is it's not that I determine
6579920	6582680	what the object of knowledge is, or the object
6582680	6585040	determines what knowledge is.
6585040	6587400	We're not making these distinctions anymore.
6587400	6590960	So the move of using the eye to anchor the reference of this
6590960	6595080	is out, because we're not considering any other of this.
6595080	6597840	So really, the difference is that sensuous certainty
6597840	6604440	originally was sort of non-punctual or non- it
6604440	6607600	was willing to acknowledge that something outside
6607600	6612280	of a single knowing instance was knowledge.
6612280	6614440	So you said, well, what about when you were perceiving
6614440	6615520	the tree rather than the house?
6615520	6616960	Oh, OK, the answer to that.
6616960	6619920	Now it just says, I don't know what you're talking about.
6619920	6623480	That means sensuous certainty, once both subject and object
6623480	6626160	are equally the essence, which means certainly neither of them
6626160	6634680	are, that I feel like some of you are still
6634680	6636800	stuck at that point about everyone's special knowing
6636800	6638200	is because you're like, but wait,
6638200	6640760	my third grade teacher told us we were all like,
6640760	6643000	was she lying to me?
6643000	6643500	Sorry.
6648200	6650440	So the idea is, sensuous certainty,
6650440	6654660	now that we've gotten this revised version of sensuous certainty
6654660	6659480	that's revised it so in order to resolve these problems,
6659480	6662240	it knows this.
6662240	6663560	Now it knows this.
6663560	6665480	And it knows nothing about that, and doesn't want
6665480	6666680	to hear anything about that.
6666680	6668000	And now it knows this.
6668000	6671480	It doesn't know anything about that, doesn't want to hear about that.
6671480	6672240	That's the idea.
6672240	6677000	So it's giving up on any particular privilege in having it.
6677000	6679000	Yeah.
6679040	6682480	I'm wondering how exactly is sensuous certainty
6682480	6685400	is the only conception of knowledge available to itself,
6685400	6687880	like separate from itself?
6687880	6692440	Like sensuous certainty can't separate between particular pieces?
6692440	6693400	Yeah, so good.
6693400	6703720	So the very idea of a conception of knowledge requires concepts.
6703720	6707360	Therefore, it has to be able to conceptualize
6707360	6710120	it's not.
6710120	6713880	It has to be able to sort of say about itself what knowledge is,
6713880	6717600	even if that doesn't go in the object of knowledge.
6717600	6721680	Now the worry here, so we don't want,
6721680	6724240	so there's two extremes that we want to avoid.
6724240	6727480	We want to avoid on the one hand what we've been calling caveman's.
6727480	6729920	It's probably deep into a caveman, I apologize.
6729920	6733160	Caveman consciousness, where it just knows an object,
6733160	6737760	doesn't even have a conception of itself in it.
6737760	6739880	It's probably more like animal consciousness.
6739880	6746720	On the other hand, we want to avoid a consciousness,
6746720	6750880	or shape of consciousness, that has a conceptually
6750880	6753680	or articulate conception of knowledge,
6753680	6756040	but then doesn't think that that conceptually
6756040	6758280	or articulate conception of knowledge
6758280	6761040	is one of the objects of its knowledge,
6761040	6763360	and can make the following move.
6763360	6769200	It can say, oh, look, I can explain why the object of my knowledge
6769200	6771640	is the pencil, rather than the parts of the pencil,
6771640	6774360	by using concepts.
6774360	6778000	But the object of my consciousness, the object of my knowledge,
6778000	6781520	is non-conception.
6781520	6783240	You see what the problem is?
6783240	6786840	Because then it could answer Hegel's critique,
6786840	6788960	while remaining sensuous certainty
6788960	6791360	in its conception of knowledge.
6791360	6795560	So the worry is that sensuous certainty can answer Hegel's
6795560	6801120	criticism by saying, oh, in my conceptually
6801120	6804280	or articulate account of what knowledge is,
6804280	6807840	I can explain why my consciousness is consciousness
6807840	6810320	of this object rather than that object,
6810320	6813120	even though none of the stuff that I just said
6813120	6816080	can be among the objects of consciousness.
6816080	6818040	And so we need a principled reason
6818040	6823120	for locating sensuous certainty between the skill of caveman
6823120	6828040	consciousness and the caribdis of overly conceptually
6828040	6832160	sophisticated sensuous certainty.
6832160	6834760	And it's possible.
6834760	6836760	So I said before, one worry that people
6836760	6838960	have had about sensuous certainty for a long time
6838960	6842520	is Hegel is making sensuous certainty answer questions
6842520	6845440	it doesn't have to answer or can't answer.
6845440	6848080	That's sort of the worry about caveman consciousness.
6848080	6851600	The worry about what I'm calling conceptually sophisticated
6851600	6856920	sensuous certainty is it can answer Hegel's critique.
6856920	6860040	But the material it uses to answer Hegel's critique
6860040	6862280	doesn't go in the object of consciousness.
6862280	6863820	It's not one of the things it knows,
6863820	6866280	or one of the things it's conscious of.
6866280	6871680	It's meta philosophical, or it's meta epistemological account
6871680	6875040	of what the object of consciousness is.
6875040	6878520	So fully defending Hegel would require explaining
6878520	6883640	our principle way why that is not a legitimate move.
6886600	6887400	Yes, so far.
6887400	6888200	Sensuous search.
6888200	6890480	So who is it fighting with?
6890480	6892240	That's a phrase to use.
6892240	6893080	It's some.
6893080	6893600	OK.
6893600	6895760	Yeah, it's some.
6895760	6896280	Yes.
6896280	6898520	Why can't universality or universality
6898520	6900600	be known immediately?
6900600	6905800	This is a sort of, so a universal can't be
6905800	6908920	known as a universal immediately.
6908920	6911280	Because to know something as a universal,
6911280	6915400	you have to distinguish it from a predicament.
6915400	6918480	So to be conscious of something as a universal,
6918480	6922080	you have to be aware of it as a one over many.
6922080	6925240	And that requires us distinct from the many.
6925240	6926840	But why is it not the other way around?
6926840	6929680	That you first understand this unity to things
6929680	6932240	and then you can understand particulars.
6932240	6935120	Why do we have to understand distinct particulars first
6935120	6938080	in order to understand what a universal is?
6938080	6939840	I mean, the same thing.
6939840	6941680	I didn't say you have to understand the particulars
6941680	6942160	first.
6942160	6944240	To understand a particular is a particular.
6944240	6947040	You also have to understand it as distinct from potentially
6947040	6950640	other particulars and from universals that it realizes.
6950640	6954760	So that's also media.
6954760	6962880	So the immediate, the thing that you know immediately
6962880	6972440	is this, which now, sensuous certainty doesn't say of it
6972440	6973680	that it's a universal.
6973680	6976240	Because it's not aware of it as a universal.
6976240	6980360	We, the chronological observers, are aware of it as a universal.
6980360	6985640	Let me ask, how many of you are totally lost?
6985640	6987880	Raise your hand if you are totally lost.
6987880	6990840	Someone, OK, there's 0% chance that only three of you
6990840	6992040	are totally lost.
6992040	6992800	Just be honest.
6995840	6996680	OK.
6996680	7000360	Someone who is totally lost, tell me
7000360	7004480	the last place in which you were not lost.
7004480	7006080	Where did you get lost?
7006080	7007840	Someone we have not heard from yet.
7010480	7012480	I saw some hands in the background.
7015640	7017560	Anybody?
7017560	7018760	OK, Krista.
7018760	7020400	I'm not sure you're going to be like,
7020400	7023320	I got lost at this place, which is way further along
7023320	7025560	than where other people got lost.
7025560	7031040	So how do we get to pure being and what
7031040	7033680	sensory sense is pure being?
7033680	7036040	So the way we get to pure being is, first of all,
7036040	7042840	we just assume that the object of knowledge is what it is.
7042840	7044520	You only know what it is.
7044520	7049640	Now, sensuous certainty is immediate consciousness.
7049640	7054400	That means what it is conscious of can't be determined.
7054400	7057800	Because determinacy always involves idiomatic.
7057800	7061240	That means it cannot be contrast of a particular being.
7061240	7067920	That means it cannot be conscious of a determinate being,
7067920	7070720	one being as opposed to another being.
7070720	7074200	Because to be conscious of one being as opposed to another being,
7074200	7081200	a determinate being, requires negation, which is a kind of mediation.
7081200	7084680	That means because it's conscious of what is,
7084680	7087040	because all knowledge is knowledge of what is,
7087040	7090400	it's not knowledge of a determinate being,
7090400	7094680	any determinate being, or even a very indeterminate being.
7094680	7100240	It's conscious of indeterminate pure being without any determinacy.
7100240	7104760	So pure being is not a very special being.
7104760	7107600	It's not the universal being, because that
7107600	7111200	would be determinate or universal rather than a particular.
7111200	7114160	It's not God.
7114280	7117800	It's not the so-called bear particular, because that's
7117800	7119800	a particular rather than a universal.
7119800	7123560	It's just being.
7123560	7127960	It's what Parmenides is talking about.
7127960	7132320	OK, I'm sorry, I don't know your name.
7132320	7134480	Did you say you were lost?
7134480	7135960	Eventually, I didn't get lost.
7135960	7139200	Do you want to tell me the last place where you were not lost?
7139200	7140360	Did you trace your steps?
7140360	7142360	No, I wasn't around the being thing.
7142360	7143480	OK, that's great.
7144240	7146920	If you only got lost at being, you're doing very good.
7146920	7150480	Being is a very respectable place to get lost at.
7150480	7156960	I got lost the move of using the eye to anchor this.
7156960	7164600	So the idea is Hegel says, look, here and now are universals,
7164600	7169400	because that's a here, that's a here, that's a here.
7169400	7171200	Every time is a now.
7171200	7173360	Consciousness says, OK, this is a version
7173360	7175400	of making the indexical move.
7175400	7181320	It says, here is wherever I am, and now
7181320	7183360	is whenever I am speaking.
7183360	7185040	OK, good.
7185040	7189680	But now notice, I is also a universal or an indexical.
7189680	7192520	You can say I, I can say I, everyone here can.
7192520	7195960	I'm assuming everyone here can say I.
7195960	7200240	That means that for consciousness to use that move,
7200240	7203440	it has to distinguish its eye from other eyes.
7203440	7206480	That is just as to say, I, as uttered by any speaker,
7206480	7210400	S, refers to X. But that requires
7210400	7214680	the difference between a particular instance
7214680	7219080	of the variable and the general term binding the variable.
7219080	7220760	And that's a version of the distinction
7220760	7222400	between particulars and traversals.
7222400	7225280	That requires negations.
7225280	7229200	That's a form of determinacy, and it can't do that.
7229640	7231720	Is the order a matter of whether Hegel
7231720	7233880	does time first or space first?
7233880	7234800	I don't think so.
7234800	7236320	That's a good question.
7236320	7240480	But he does time in both cases first, and I'm not sure why.
7240480	7242560	Yes?
7242560	7243920	No, you.
7243920	7248720	Just why can't determination or distinction be given immediately?
7248720	7252120	Because I feel like I can immediately see differences.
7252120	7254040	This is a really good question, and it's
7254040	7257960	totally foundational in Hegel that he doesn't think
7257960	7259120	that it can be.
7259920	7264800	Now, for a really good argument, we have not seen one yet.
7264800	7267240	But the basic idea, it's in a certain way,
7267240	7269640	it's a version of the Kantian points
7269640	7272080	that the combination of the manifold
7272080	7274920	is not given by the senses.
7274920	7279480	If any immediate form of awareness,
7279480	7283800	not by means of anything else, does not
7283800	7288680	acquaint you with anything that's determinate.
7288680	7290840	Determinately one way rather than another.
7290840	7293600	For it to be determinately one way rather than another,
7293600	7297560	you have to be aware of it as determinately one way
7297560	7298440	rather than the other.
7298440	7300040	And that means your awareness of it
7300040	7303680	is that way is mediated by your awareness of the ways
7303680	7305760	it might otherwise be.
7305760	7310200	This is so foundational for Hegel.
7310200	7313400	I'm not even sure he ever argued sort of.
7313400	7316080	An immediate relation is a relation
7316080	7318520	to something indeterminate.
7318520	7322000	And that means all of the immediate stuff.
7322000	7326320	So people in this period love appealing
7326320	7328360	to immediate awareness of things.
7328360	7330960	And the Hegelian move repeated over and over
7330960	7335400	is that makes the object of your awareness totally indeterminate.
7335400	7337400	OK, now here's a challenging question.
7338040	7345200	Is any of this in sensual certainty a criticism of Kant?
7345200	7350120	Does Kant have to disagree with any of any in sensual certainty?
7353800	7355440	You want to take a stab at it?
7355440	7358000	There might be a way in which if you read Kant's definition
7358000	7360320	of intuition at the beginning, that this is just
7360320	7362680	an attack on that conception, that you can be immediately
7362680	7364520	related to the object.
7364520	7368480	OK, so on one way of thinking about this,
7368480	7372240	this is a criticism of Kant's notion of intuition.
7372240	7375800	Because intuition is an immediate relation.
7375800	7378320	And Kant thinks it's an immediate relation
7378320	7380560	to a determinate object.
7380560	7384880	That's the intuition of this object rather than another.
7384880	7392440	But you could also think Kant completely
7392440	7398360	agrees that in order for you to be conscious of your intuition
7398360	7400480	as being of one object rather than another,
7400480	7403600	you have to conceptualize it.
7403600	7405600	So it's not at all clear that Kant
7405600	7409760	has to disagree with it like this.
7409760	7416360	So let me just repeat that line of thought very briefly.
7416360	7418960	So one reading of Kant, which I don't think
7418960	7420600	is a right reading but simply upheld,
7420600	7423480	is that intuitions, because they are immediate,
7423480	7425920	are completely indeterminate.
7425920	7430320	The object of intuition without concept is just totally indeterminate.
7430320	7432600	I think that doesn't make any sense in Kant.
7432600	7437080	But if that's what Kant's view, then Hegel's just making his point forward.
7437080	7440800	I think it's much more plausible that Kant thinks that intuition
7440800	7442920	is an intuition of a determinate object.
7442920	7444320	It's a particular object.
7444320	7445680	It's an intuition of this object.
7445680	7449520	It's not just an intuition of objects that are indeterminate.
7449560	7454680	But Kant can, I think, acknowledge the point here by saying, oh, that's right.
7454680	7458280	But in order for you to be conscious of that object of intuition
7458280	7463920	as the object of that intuition, you need to conceptualize it.
7463920	7464680	Yes?
7464680	7465240	Yeah.
7465240	7468920	Just one question about that last comparison between the two
7468920	7469960	that you made.
7469960	7472720	It seems to me when you're talking about the object for Hegel,
7472720	7475680	that seems much more broad than the object for Kant.
7475680	7477840	I think we would grant that the object does need
7477840	7479440	to fall under concepts for Kant.
7479440	7485440	But it seems like there are things that when Kant wouldn't consider an object,
7485440	7488200	but you suggest that Hegel maybe would.
7488200	7489960	And that would seem to maybe.
7489960	7493120	So object at this point is supposed to be totally general.
7493120	7495000	It's the object of consciousness.
7495000	7497720	The only more specific notion of object that we've seen
7497720	7499400	is the object of sensuous certainty.
7499400	7502480	And that's quite determinate.
7502480	7505440	It's intended to be a very determinate conception of an object.
7505440	7507960	Something you can be sensuously certain of.
7507960	7510240	You can't be sensuously certain of God.
7510240	7512520	You can't be sensuously certain of the laws of nature.
7512520	7513560	You don't sense them.
7513560	7516280	You can't be sensuously certain of propositions inside of it.
7516280	7519400	So we can see the most general possible notion of object at all,
7519400	7523560	and an attempt at a highly determinate one, where the highly
7523560	7526320	determinate one has Hegel or he's fate.
7529640	7533680	I'm tempted to think that Kant would just say everything even concepts
7533680	7536600	are immediate because of self-consciousness.
7536600	7542240	So then there's no real problem for him that, for example,
7542240	7547080	to think that we can't immediately know what universal means.
7547080	7550280	Because everything's kind of immediate.
7550280	7554040	Sorry, did you say immediate or immediate?
7554040	7555320	Immediate.
7555320	7559640	But Kant's conceptual representation is immediate representation.
7559640	7563920	To have a concept is to represent something
7563920	7567240	by means of the marks of that concept.
7567240	7573400	So conceptual representation, as such, is immediate.
7573400	7577760	What about just unity of app perception, the baseline?
7577760	7579640	Is that kind of immediate?
7579640	7584760	And from there, you can just know how things are like?
7584760	7589080	So I'm immediately conscious of myself as combining.
7589080	7591280	But in order for me to be conscious of anything,
7591280	7593680	something has to be given to me in tuition.
7593680	7595320	And I have to conceptualize it.
7595320	7599120	So you're right, I'm immediately conscious of myself as acting.
7599120	7604640	But what Hegel would say is that I is totally indeterminate.
7604640	7605680	That's kind of the point.
7605680	7606600	It's totally empty.
7606600	7608120	The I has no content.
7608120	7611500	So Hegel would actually think that, on that point,
7611500	7613760	Kant completely agrees with it.
7613760	7617960	But I'm worried that we're kind of losing everybody with Kant.
7617960	7619120	Yes, sorry.
7619120	7622480	Just one more comment.
7622480	7622960	Great.
7622960	7624040	I think it was all met.
7624040	7627640	Is there an issue with Hegel's specific case in time
7627640	7631000	as you adrift with it or not?
7631000	7632120	Yes.
7632120	7639200	Depending on how strongly, it depends on what
7639200	7641800	Hegel means by calling space and time universal.
7641800	7645400	I think all he means by universal is a one over met.
7645400	7648560	And in that very minimal sense, space and time
7648560	7650520	are ones over many in Kant.
7650520	7652720	They're not conceptual universals.
7652720	7654200	But yeah, that's a good question.
7654200	7658400	I guess you repeat your indexical formulation
7658400	7660320	of the universality of the I.
7660320	7661200	Oh, absolutely.
7663880	7665040	I would love to do that.
7665040	7667680	OK.
7667680	7691640	Or any speaker S I has uttered by mass refers to S.
7691640	7695520	Seems unarguable.
7695520	7697360	What did you learn today in philosophy class?
7697360	7701200	Well, we learned whenever anyone says I, I refers to them,
7701200	7703880	the person who said it.
7703880	7706640	How much is the tuition of the school is?
7706640	7712320	So the idea is notice that this requires
7712320	7715560	a difference between the universal speaker
7715560	7718440	and individual values of this variable.
7718440	7721640	If we wrote this out, it would start with the quantifiable
7721640	7726360	clause for all S. If S is a speaker,
7727360	7729440	and that just has contained within it
7729440	7732040	the difference between a particular and a universal,
7732040	7735240	that involves mediation, it involves determinacy.
7735240	7739040	None of that can be in the content of what
7739040	7741160	sensuous certainty is conscious of.
7741160	7744160	Now, the question that I was talking about before
7744160	7747600	is whether it could be something sensuous certainty could
7747600	7753360	say in order to explain the reference of its consciousness
7753360	7756160	to an object, even though it's not something it's conscious of.
7756160	7757960	And that gets into the difficult question of,
7757960	7760280	how conceptually sophisticated are we
7760280	7762840	allowed to make sensuous certainty?
7762840	7764320	Willow, you have your head up.
7764320	7766160	No, he's got 109.
7766160	7766680	OK.
7766680	7767840	I understood.
7767840	7770880	Or are you going to ask me the series of Vakas?
7770880	7773080	I mean, if you want to add it to it.
7773080	7774000	You have to ask me.
7774000	7774960	Sure, sure.
7774960	7776000	Well, what are they?
7776000	7777120	I just read off the bad.
7777120	7778720	Well, they're Roman gods.
7778720	7779240	You know that.
7779240	7779560	There you go.
7779560	7780320	Yes, I do know that.
7780320	7781120	OK.
7781120	7782200	That's not what I would do.
7782200	7782700	OK.
7782860	7787780	What I was curious about, anyway, was the so I understood you
7787780	7793500	as saying that sensuous sort of, you know,
7793500	7795500	says it knows pure being, but really knows
7795500	7797900	this specific thing, this pencil, whatever.
7797900	7802100	And then it's an issue that you can't know pure being
7802100	7804100	through your senses and whatnot.
7804100	7805980	Where does that come from?
7805980	7807980	You know, you can't know it through your senses.
7807980	7810620	That does seem obvious to me, but would this have to be given?
7810900	7815380	So it doesn't come up here, such as the series of Vakas passage.
7815380	7818740	So it was a response to a worry that you might have.
7818740	7822860	Hegel is assuming that by having demonstrated
7822860	7826980	that what sensuous certainty can say of its object,
7826980	7829340	namely that it's pure being, cannot be
7829340	7831620	what it means to be its object.
7831620	7833740	But then why couldn't sensuous certainty just
7833740	7836060	say, this is a question that as far as I know,
7836060	7838380	Hegel doesn't address, that, oh, no, no.
7839260	7841620	That's both what I said and what I meant to be my object.
7841620	7843500	The object of sensuous certainty is pure being.
7846340	7847620	And he doesn't address this.
7847620	7851300	Now then you might say, well, OK, how could sensibility,
7851300	7854740	how could the senses acquaint you with pure being?
7854740	7856940	But now I will talk about series in Vakas.
7856940	7858420	So this is a great passage.
7858420	7860260	With its appeal to universal experience,
7860260	7862620	we may be participating to anticipate concerns
7862620	7864020	in the practical sense.
7864020	7866340	So the phenomenology is not just about theoretical knowledge,
7866340	7868860	it's also about practical knowledge, knowledgeable is good.
7868860	7871020	In this respect, what one can say
7871020	7873260	to those who make assertions about the truth and reality
7873260	7876380	of sensuous objects is that they should be sent back
7876380	7878900	to the most elementary school of wisdom,
7878900	7883780	namely to the old Ellucidian secrets of Ceres and Vakas.
7883780	7887260	So the Ellucidian mysteries are this mystery cult
7887260	7891300	in ancient Greece that you would be inducted into,
7891300	7894620	and you would be taught various cosmic truths
7894620	7897100	about the universe that we don't know that much about it.
7897100	7902300	But Hegel knows as much as anyone in the 19th century
7902300	7906820	other than Schelling about classical antiquity.
7906820	7912180	And he has a view about what the esoteric doctrine, the insider
7912180	7914460	teaching of the Ellucidian mystery cult was.
7914460	7915960	And he's about to tell us what is.
7915960	7918820	And they have yet to learn the secret of the eating of the bread
7918820	7921100	and drinking of the wine.
7921100	7924340	This is so because the person who has been initiated into these secrets
7924380	7927500	not only comes to doubt the being of sensuous things,
7927500	7930540	but rather it arrives at despair about them.
7930540	7933020	In part, he brings about their nothingness.
7933020	7937660	And in part, he seems them to seize them to do it to themselves.
7937660	7942620	So what Hegel is referencing is the fact that on his view,
7942620	7945820	what you learned in the Ellucidian mysteries
7945820	7951020	was that no individual being has any reality.
7951020	7954740	And you learned this by basically taking a lot of drugs.
7954740	7956020	I'm totally serious.
7956020	7957420	This is almost certainly true.
7957420	7959260	Almost certainly true of all these ancient mystery
7959260	7962340	cults were based on the heavy use of all this magic.
7962340	7965460	That's like you can actually prove this archaeologically
7965460	7968140	because you can get plant residue from these various bowls
7968140	7971060	and you can figure out what psychedelics they use.
7971060	7973420	You take a bunch of psychedelics, and then they would perform
7973420	7974940	these little pageants for you.
7974940	7977420	And then the point on Hegel's interpretation,
7977420	7979580	the point of the pageant was to discover
7979580	7982820	that no finite being has any reality.
7982820	7986460	The only being that's real is pure being.
7986460	7990020	So the point is the people who insist
7990020	7993660	on the reality of individual things, the sensuous certainty
7993660	7998860	person, needs to go do the Ellucidian mysteries.
7998860	8001940	And what they'll see is that's the true result of their view,
8001940	8005300	that the only thing that's real is pure being.
8005300	8007300	Now what are the animals excluded from this wisdom?
8007300	8008780	Instead, they prove themselves to be
8008780	8010620	the most deeply initiated into it,
8010620	8013180	for they do not stand still in the face of sensuous things
8013180	8015220	as if those things existed in themselves.
8015220	8016980	Despairing of the reality of those things
8016980	8019420	and in the total certainty of the nullity of those things,
8019420	8021180	they without any further ado simply
8021180	8023380	help themselves to them and devour them.
8023380	8025020	Just like the animals, all of nature
8025020	8026780	celebrates these revealed mysteries,
8026780	8031260	which teach the truth about sensuous things.
8031260	8033700	So Hegel is saying, even the animals know better
8033700	8035580	than the sensuous certainty person,
8035580	8037780	they know that finite things don't have any reality
8037780	8039900	because you can just eat them.
8039900	8041660	So is that just a joke?
8041660	8043020	It's not just a joke.
8043020	8046340	Because Hegel's view, Hegel's true view,
8046340	8048860	he's not someone who believes that the only thing that's
8048860	8050220	real is pure being.
8050220	8054060	That view is called a cosmose.
8054060	8060620	It's the view that denies the existence of the cosmos,
8060620	8064500	where we take the cosmos to mean determinate beings,
8064500	8068260	determinate or find ideas.
8068260	8072140	So if an atheist is someone who denies the existence of God,
8072140	8075820	and a cosmist is someone who denies the existence of beings,
8075820	8077620	there's only pure being.
8077620	8081460	Now Hegel, I'm sort of obsessed with this.
8081460	8083380	Some of you heard me talk about this many, many times.
8083380	8084900	This is one of my great hobby horses.
8084900	8089060	Hegel is obsessed with refuting a cosmose.
8089060	8096900	In fact, the science of logic, in a less temperate moment,
8096900	8098940	I would say Hegel's entire philosophical project
8098940	8100660	consists in the reputation of a cosmose.
8100660	8102340	That's a little bit of an exaggeration.
8102340	8105300	But his view about the North, so Hegel
8105300	8108540	does not think that the Eleusinian mysteries are
8108540	8109540	getting you at the truth.
8109540	8111500	Namely, all there is is pure being and finite things
8111500	8112860	have no reality.
8112860	8115260	He thinks that view is incoherent.
8115260	8117260	Because if they have no finite reality,
8117260	8121060	how could you have thought they had a finite reality?
8121060	8123700	The illusory being is a kind of being.
8123700	8127660	So they can't not exist at all.
8127660	8131820	And furthermore, he thinks that the pressure to a cosmism
8131820	8133980	is endemic or internal, more or less,
8133980	8135820	to the entire Western philosophical tradition.
8135820	8137900	In fact, Western philosophy begins with a cosmism.
8137900	8140980	It begins with Parnedians.
8140980	8144900	And it returns in the form of Spinoza,
8145540	8147780	he thinks Spinoza, although he Spinoza denies it,
8147780	8151460	Spinoza's view entails that no finite things exist.
8151460	8154060	In fact, not just no finite things, no beings exist.
8154060	8155100	God is not a being.
8155100	8156260	God is just pure being.
8156260	8157700	That's what Hegel thinks Western is.
8157700	8160580	He's also read it.
8160580	8163460	And he thinks that his entire philosophical tradition,
8163460	8166060	fifth de Chale, all of his pals, also
8166060	8170820	have this problem that their fundamental first principle,
8170820	8174180	the I or the indifference point, actually
8174180	8177180	eliminates the existence of all finite things.
8177180	8178540	It eliminates all beings.
8178540	8180580	It's just pure being.
8180580	8182860	So what we have to do is maintain
8182860	8185660	the existence of finite things, but not in this dumb way
8185660	8187740	that sexual certainty wants to.
8187740	8189980	Here's a being, here's another being,
8189980	8192940	and they're unrelated to one another.
8192940	8194980	In fact, the way we have to retain
8194980	8198300	the being of finite things is the way the animals do,
8198300	8201620	which is to say, they have a, finite things
8201620	8207820	have a kind of being, which is then subrelated,
8207820	8210500	but then retained at a higher level.
8210500	8213020	So we'll talk about this in the logic,
8213020	8217340	but the digestive model of the animal's relationship
8217340	8219580	to finite things is, in fact, Hegel's
8219580	8221500	view about the reality of finite things.
8221500	8223500	So what he's saying is, you need to go
8223500	8225420	to the L.O. studio of mysteries, or more properly,
8225420	8227060	just to pay attention to animals.
8227060	8231060	And what you'll see is, finite things do have a kind of being.
8231940	8232780	Then we'll read some more.
8232780	8234940	Actually, in the back, we have not heard from you.
8234940	8236540	Yeah, sorry.
8236540	8240860	So then, where does, I guess, Hegel's one time student,
8240860	8242420	Sterner fall out?
8242420	8243860	I have no idea.
8243860	8246660	I've never read any Sterner, because it just
8246660	8249460	sounds so insane.
8249460	8252220	Generally, so after Hegel's death,
8252220	8256420	or even during Hegel's life, people
8256420	8258980	divide in their reactions to Hegel
8258980	8261700	between so-called left Hegelians, who
8261700	8264660	think that the true philosophical message of Hegel
8264660	8268260	is revolutionary with respect to traditional religion
8268260	8269780	in the Prussian state.
8269780	8273780	Right Hegelians, who think Hegel is a defender
8273780	8276940	of orthodox Lutheranism, and the Prussian monarchy,
8276940	8278660	and the true view.
8278660	8283100	Central Hegelianism, Hegel was a central Hegelian, namely
8283100	8288340	that the true religious concept of Hegel
8288340	8292700	is not very much like orthodox Lutheranism,
8292700	8295460	but nor is it any kind of atheism,
8295460	8297140	or this Freudian nonsense about how
8297140	8299380	God is the projection of our inferiority complex,
8299380	8301820	or whatever.
8301820	8304460	And the political content of Hegelian philosophy
8304460	8306980	is a constitutional reform of the Prussian monarchy,
8306980	8309900	rather than it's in its absolutist form.
8309900	8312180	But I have not gotten into this.
8312180	8314220	Sterner is one of the big left Hegelians,
8314220	8316220	but I have, to a large extent, not really gotten
8316220	8317300	to the left Hegelianism, because they
8317340	8320140	don't feel like I understand Hegel well enough to get
8320140	8322380	into the left, right, and center Hegelianism.
8322380	8325180	OK, but before we finish today, I
8325180	8329860	want to talk about the end of 110, or actually 110.
8329860	8332900	However, those who set up such assertions in lines
8332900	8334980	with the previous remarks also immediately
8334980	8336860	say the opposite of what they mean,
8336860	8338660	a phenomenon that is perhaps best
8338660	8340340	able to bring them to reflect on the nature
8340340	8341740	of the century with certainty.
8341740	8343980	They speak of the existence of external objects,
8343980	8345660	which, to put it more precisely, can
8345660	8347860	be turned into the actual, absolutely singular,
8347860	8351140	individual, wholly personal, individual things, each of which
8351140	8353020	is absolutely unlike the others.
8353020	8356140	This existence is said to have absolute certainty and truth.
8356140	8358820	They mean this piece of paper on which I am writing,
8358820	8360620	or rather have written this.
8360620	8362900	But they do not say what they mean.
8362900	8366540	They intend to talk about concrete, sensible particulars,
8366540	8368740	but what they really say is universals.
8368740	8371020	However much they actually wanted to say what they
8371020	8373540	knew about this piece of paper, and however much they wanted
8373540	8375940	to say it, still it would be impossible
8375940	8379260	because the sensuous this, which is what is meant,
8379260	8383100	is inaccessible to the language which belongs to consciousness,
8383100	8385540	or to what is in itself universal.
8385540	8388420	In the actual attempt to say it, in itself
8388420	8390500	would therefore rot away.
8390500	8395540	So the singular, an individual, is inaccessible to the language
8395540	8400620	of consciousness because, to refer to this,
8400620	8404500	you need not just a universal, nor do you
8404500	8407660	need just a singular indexical like this.
8407660	8409420	You need both.
8409420	8412420	You need to refer to this pencil.
8412420	8415380	You need to have a conception of the object
8415380	8419020	as an instance of a universal.
8419020	8422020	So the idea is, if you just have this,
8422020	8425180	there's no account of why you're referring to the pencil
8425180	8428820	rather than the parts of the pencil, the eraser, the tip.
8428820	8433020	The only way objects can be available for consciousness
8433020	8438380	is if they are this such, an instance of a universal.
8438380	8442340	Skipping a bit, if nothing is more said of a thing,
8442340	8445820	that it is an actual thing, an external object,
8445820	8449500	that it is only expressed as the most universal of all.
8449500	8453620	And what is therefore expressed is the sameness with everything
8453620	8455700	rather than its distinctiveness.
8455700	8458700	If I say a singular thing, then instead I
8458700	8461260	say something entirely universal about it,
8461260	8463540	for everything is a singular thing.
8463540	8466700	Likewise, this thing is anything one pleases.
8466700	8470460	To characterize it more precisely as this piece of paper,
8470460	8473980	every and each bit of paper is a this, a piece of paper,
8473980	8478220	and I've only spoken, as usual, of the universal.
8478220	8480720	That is to say, I need not just a universal, but something
8480720	8482500	like a Kantian intuition.
8482500	8485100	However, if I wish to lend a helping hand to speech,
8485100	8487780	which itself has the defined nature of immediately inverting
8487780	8490540	the meaning, that of making it to something else,
8490540	8492700	and in that way of not letting the meaning get
8492700	8494220	into words at all.
8494220	8497020	So this is what Hegel loves these plays on language,
8497020	8499420	because he thinks what language shows
8499420	8502620	is this distinction between what consciousness means to say
8502620	8505140	and what it says.
8505140	8507140	Then by pointing out this piece of paper,
8507140	8509660	I thus learn from experience what the truth of sensuous
8509660	8511340	certainty, in fact, is.
8511340	8513500	I point it out as a hearer, which
8513500	8516460	is a hearer of other hearers, for which in its own self
8516460	8519700	is a simple ensemble of many hearers, which is to say,
8519700	8521140	is a universal.
8521140	8524060	In that way, I receive it as it is in truth,
8524060	8527300	and instead of noting what is immediate, I perceive.
8527300	8529740	So now what Hegel is doing is transitioning
8529740	8533820	to the transition from the first object to the second.
8533820	8536260	So that is to say, from the first form of consciousness
8536260	8538340	to the second form of consciousness.
8538340	8541100	The second form of consciousness is the determinant negation
8541180	8544020	of the first form of consciousness.
8544020	8545300	We don't have a new beginning.
8545300	8546580	We don't start from nothing.
8546580	8548500	Nor is the second shape of consciousness just,
8548500	8550220	you don't know it.
8550220	8553780	The second object is the being of the first object
8553780	8555180	for consciousness.
8555180	8558460	So insofar as the first object knew something,
8558460	8560820	the second object is what it knew.
8560820	8565460	So insofar as the first shape of consciousness knew something
8565460	8569820	or intended to know something, it was this.
8569820	8572500	But the reason it couldn't know this
8572500	8576020	is because it didn't put any universals in the shape,
8576020	8578700	in the object of its knowledge.
8578700	8582700	So the resolution of that problem
8582700	8586340	is to recognize that the object of knowledge
8586340	8590100	is a thing that instantiates universals,
8590100	8593940	a thing with properties, of this such.
8593940	8597900	Because once we have that, we have both of this,
8597900	8601380	which is something like a spatio-temporal indexical.
8601380	8604180	It indicates a direction in your environment.
8604180	8606940	But then with the concept, it picks out
8606940	8609940	in the fortunate case which thing in your environment
8609940	8611460	you're referring to.
8611460	8617300	If I say, this book, I'm screwed.
8617300	8620740	If I say, this iPhone, now I'm good to go.
8620740	8622780	And the reason that worked is because I
8622780	8625100	didn't say the iPhone or iPhones.
8625100	8627380	That will refer to all iPhones whatsoever.
8627460	8630620	Nor did I say this, because this doesn't determinately
8630620	8631780	refer to anything.
8631780	8633380	I said, this iPhone.
8633380	8637460	And that only picks out this if this is an iPhone,
8637460	8639380	and not everything else is an iPhone, which
8639380	8641700	means this has to have a universal,
8641700	8643340	has to be an instance of something,
8643340	8646860	and it has to be a universal that other things don't have,
8646860	8648940	not everything else has.
8648940	8651260	Otherwise, it wouldn't pick it up.
8651260	8652260	Yeah?
8652460	8656900	For instance, expressing it as an actual thing
8656900	8660900	and its sameness with everything else,
8660900	8662900	does this, when you speak to the students,
8662900	8664660	be that Schelling position that you
8664660	8666900	emphasize in the practice of managing the 12,000
8666900	8669700	by a computer-socially-centered student?
8669700	8670300	Yes.
8670300	8674060	In an other way, if we want to bring Schelling into that,
8674060	8683740	what he's saying is what sensuous certainty means
8683740	8686300	to know, what it intends to know,
8686300	8688260	is concrete particulars.
8688260	8690620	What it actually says it knows is
8690620	8693860	something as indeterminate as Schelling's note in which
8693860	8695980	all cows are alive.
8695980	8697460	Pure be.
8697460	8705060	Now, that brings in Schelling, but many of you
8705060	8706420	don't know who Schelling is.
8706420	8707380	Don't worry about it.
8707380	8713540	But the first principle of Schelling's philosophy,
8713540	8716780	Hegel thinks is, actually Schelling explicitly says this,
8716780	8720460	is as indeterminate as purity.
8720460	8722900	That's to say, it has no differences or determinacies
8722900	8724100	in it whatsoever.
8724100	8726980	It's completely a cosmos starting point.
8727020	8732420	So what Hegel is saying is that sensuous certainty thinks
8732420	8734740	it's the most concrete empiricist position
8734740	8735620	possible.
8735620	8738900	But what it's actually saying is that what it's conscious of
8738900	8741820	is the most insane Schellingian totally
8741820	8746460	indifferent starting point of all philosophy.
8746460	8750060	So that means that the second shape of consciousness
8750060	8756280	is one in which objects are instances of universals, things
8756280	8758520	with problems.
8758520	8761040	Now, I just want to note that if we
8761040	8766320	look at the table of contents of the phenomenology of spirit,
8766320	8769720	I think this edition has a relatively informative one.
8772720	8777000	We'll just note that the first form of consciousness
8777000	8778800	is sensuous certainty.
8778800	8781960	The second shape of consciousness is perceiving.
8781960	8783880	And the third shape of consciousness
8783880	8786880	is force and the understanding, appearance,
8786880	8789000	and the super sensible world.
8789000	8791920	So if we think of this in Kantian terms,
8791920	8793760	and then the second one is self-consciousness,
8793760	8797320	we're in a certain way building up
8797320	8799440	the capacities of the Kantian mind.
8799440	8804360	There's appearance, perception, and then understanding.
8804360	8806680	Where understanding involves making a distinction
8806680	8812920	between how things appear to you and the super sensible objects
8812920	8814440	that are appearing to you.
8814440	8818320	And then there's aperceptive self-consciousness.
8818320	8820400	Now, that doesn't mean that this is supposed
8820400	8824160	to correspond one-to-one with Kant's taxonomy
8824160	8829200	of the human mind because Hegel thinks of Kant
8829200	8830880	as he thinks of every other philosopher
8830880	8832920	as insufficiently systematic.
8832920	8835880	That's to say, we don't want a one-to-one correspondence
8835880	8838640	with Kant's quote unquote system because Kant's system isn't
8838640	8840280	really systematic.
8840360	8843480	This is the systematic articulation
8843480	8846000	of everything that has to be in spirit in order
8846000	8848320	for spirit to be spirit.
8848320	8851360	But even properly, it maybe isn't that
8851360	8854800	because it's doing that by way of uncovering
8854800	8857480	the internal dialectical failures of all
8857480	8862400	of these other conceptions of what now it is.
8862400	8862880	Yeah.
8862880	8864000	Yeah.
8864000	8867080	I have a question similar to Kantian's one.
8867080	8868760	And it's just about concepts.
8868840	8872240	I feel like in the Cartesian sense,
8872240	8874560	the thoughts in itself themselves
8874560	8877360	are kind of immediate to us.
8877360	8881840	And then with perceptual input, we see new things.
8881840	8885560	And we maybe we can modify all those concepts and so on.
8885560	8887520	It's like backwards.
8887520	8892960	So that is a remark in a different way
8892960	8896720	of doing philosophy, a way of doing philosophy in which we
8896720	8900120	start with what seems plausible to us,
8900120	8902520	and then we reason from there.
8902520	8904000	That's not what Hegel is doing.
8904000	8906320	That's not how the phenomenology works.
8906320	8910160	The phenomenology does not work with any.
8910160	8913480	Our assumptions are supposed to be completely suspended.
8913480	8916760	And it's supposed to unfold from the most immediate,
8916760	8920120	that is to say, indeterminate shape of knowledge possible,
8920120	8922080	everything that knowledge is.
8922080	8925040	So what seems to us plausible isn't,
8925040	8927520	so to speak, argumentatively relevant.
8927520	8934160	And so likewise, what's phenomenologically available
8934160	8938000	to us in Dufcerlian sense also isn't relevant,
8938000	8944600	because that would assume a different conception
8944600	8946520	of what knowledge is, which hasn't been dialectically
8946520	8949440	unfolded yet in phenomenology.
8949440	8950720	Yeah.
8950720	8952600	In the previous lecture, you said
8952600	8955040	that each shape of consciousness
8955040	8959200	has to determine the next shape of consciousness.
8959200	8962080	It seems like pure consciousness has options
8962080	8965840	between sticking to its original claim.
8965840	8967720	I know particulars.
8967720	8970880	Or just going into pure being.
8970880	8972840	How about an issue?
8972840	8974200	It is an issue.
8974200	8976400	The systematic structure of phenomenology
8976400	8980520	requires that there be one and only one successor
8980520	8981800	shape of consciousness.
8981800	8985800	If there's forking paths, then the argument is real.
8985800	8990360	So if we really want to take phenomenology seriously,
8990360	8992400	we have to ask ourselves at every step,
8992400	8995040	is there a potential forking path here?
8995040	8999720	And the move towards pure being is one such forking path.
8999720	9002640	Now, I think Hegel thinks he has a number of reasons
9002640	9006760	to foreclose sensuous certainty of pure being
9006760	9009480	as a possibility, one of which will be relevant when we talk
9009480	9011240	about pure being and logic, is I think
9011240	9015680	he thinks pure being is not a possible object of knowledge
9015680	9017440	because it's so indeterminate.
9017440	9020000	You can't know pure being.
9020000	9022120	What would you know?
9022120	9024680	What did you learn at school today, pure being?
9024680	9025680	Oh, tell me about that.
9025680	9027880	It is.
9027880	9030480	It is just purely.
9030480	9031840	Is there any particular way?
9031840	9032560	Oh, no, no, no.
9032560	9033680	It's not any particular way.
9033680	9034160	It just did.
9037520	9038400	Yes, fine.
9038400	9040120	Each of the arguments Hegel makes,
9040440	9042520	are those supposedly the only arguments that
9042520	9044920	can be made to move from one argument to the next?
9047840	9048920	Good question.
9048920	9051240	I don't think Hegel wants to like,
9051240	9054080	we don't want to read Hegel as having some like,
9054080	9057960	implausible view or like, these words in exactly this order
9057960	9059080	have to be written this way.
9059080	9063400	So like, there has to be some flexibility or plasticity
9063400	9065280	in the order of presentation.
9065280	9068240	Like, did he have to do this whole thing of doing,
9069200	9072800	now is night, and here's the tree, here's the house.
9072800	9074160	I see the tree.
9074160	9076160	I see the house as someone else.
9076160	9077880	Couldn't he have just skipped immediately
9077880	9080160	to the form of sensuous certainty
9080160	9082840	in which there's no essential difference,
9082840	9085120	no difference in essence between subject and object?
9085120	9086680	Probably.
9086680	9091240	But the problems arise from the shape of consciousness itself,
9091240	9095040	and therefore, they cannot be Hegel's invention.
9095040	9097320	So I'll just warn, I mean, one of the reasons
9097320	9099120	I don't love teaching the phenomenology of spirit
9099120	9100120	as the whole book, I actually love
9100120	9103280	teaching sensuous certainty because people get the point.
9103280	9107200	And you can actually kind of philosophically engage with it,
9107200	9108440	pretty straightforwardly.
9108440	9111160	One of the reasons I don't love teaching the whole book is,
9111160	9114560	the further you go in the book, the harder it is to believe
9114560	9116840	all of the transitions are principled.
9116840	9120600	So famously, as a friend of mine, I put it this way,
9120600	9122880	it's more or less impossible to predict
9122880	9125200	what the next shape of consciousness is going to be,
9125240	9127800	which is a sign that there is not, in fact,
9127800	9130640	a principal function that takes you from shape of consciousness
9130640	9133280	n to n plus 1, because then we would just learn the function.
9133280	9134800	Every time I read the phenomenology,
9134800	9136840	I'm a little surprised by what comes next.
9136840	9138120	I'm like, really?
9138120	9139400	Why that?
9139400	9144240	Likewise, it's hard by the end of the book
9144240	9150800	to feel like all of these problems are purely interned.
9150800	9152560	My general sense is, I kind of feel
9152560	9155400	like I have a line on what's going on everything up
9155400	9156440	through reason.
9156440	9158520	And then the transition, once we transition
9158520	9160800	to spirit in the middle of the book,
9160800	9164120	the feeling of arbitrariness in the successor
9164120	9167480	shapes of consciousness and the problems that arise
9167480	9170920	starts to just kind of grow exponentially.
9170920	9174840	So after we get to reason, we get to spirit.
9174840	9178000	And the first shape of spirit is this shape of spirit
9178000	9187160	in which somehow your family is in touch
9187160	9191440	with the gods of the underworld.
9191440	9193520	But then in your public life, you're
9193520	9198360	like a good patriotic Greek citizen.
9198360	9201440	So it's just like, what?
9201440	9203240	Why are we talking about antigone?
9203240	9206680	It's just very hard for me to really be convinced
9206680	9208840	about every transition.
9208840	9211680	I'm not a super phenomenology optimist.
9211680	9213800	Just to make sure I got this, however,
9213800	9218280	the paradox of sense certainty is not
9218280	9221440	being able to say what it means or the contradiction to what
9221440	9224920	it means when it says, are the rocks on which sense certainty
9224920	9230080	as a shape of knowing, for example.
9230080	9233280	And that's what causes the despair, is it,
9233280	9236040	that lifts us up to the next?
9236040	9236540	Exactly.
9236540	9238280	Up to the next state.
9238280	9244320	And that's an example of an internal self-contradiction.
9244320	9246800	Or imminent, yeah.
9246800	9251800	Could not the advocate of sense certainty
9251800	9257480	say that contradiction is not part of its bag
9257480	9260040	and that therefore what's being advanced against it
9260040	9261800	is actually an external criteria?
9261800	9262680	Good.
9262680	9265440	Gets to a fundamental issue in Hegel's philosophy.
9265520	9269160	Why do we have to care about contradictions?
9269160	9273720	Foundational, if we just read the way the book works,
9273720	9280280	it seems absolutely foundational that contradictions are death.
9280280	9282400	That means you get a contradiction,
9282400	9284000	you have to overcome it.
9284000	9288840	Sense to a certainty cannot just rest content.
9288840	9291440	Just be like, yep, I know this object.
9291440	9293280	That object is not knowable.
9293280	9295040	What's the problem?
9295840	9300560	Now, this will be more relevant in the science of logic.
9300560	9303920	But Hegel's, both the phenomenology and the science
9303920	9306640	of logic, mostly explicitly, I kind of think actually
9306640	9308440	the entire encyclopedia, the entire system,
9308440	9313040	depends on uncovering and reconciling contradictions.
9313040	9315840	Now, that's true, as you just brought out,
9315840	9318520	from the word one of the phenomenology.
9318520	9322440	It will also be true from word one of the science of logic.
9322440	9325760	Now, no justification is given to us.
9325760	9328960	So that means it's internal, it's foundational for Hegel,
9328960	9331600	that you cannot just rest content with a contradiction.
9331600	9334120	You have to move beyond.
9334120	9338520	Now, that means that a certain kind of attitude
9338520	9340680	towards the principle of contradiction
9340680	9344600	is built into the way the whole philosophical system works.
9344600	9347400	One view about contradictions is that contradictions cannot even
9347400	9349720	be thought.
9349720	9353480	You can say P and not P, but you haven't thought anything.
9353480	9357320	Kant can be read as saying that.
9357320	9360560	Another view is that you just shouldn't
9360560	9363000	believe contradictions, you shouldn't think of them.
9363000	9365320	You can, but you shouldn't give them.
9365320	9367680	Kant can also be read that way.
9367680	9371720	The problem with the don't do it is, OK,
9371720	9374360	I do a lot of things I shouldn't do.
9374360	9377600	What's so bad about contradicting myself?
9377600	9379320	What I say won't be true, but I also
9379320	9382560	say a lot of things aren't true.
9382560	9385840	The problem with that you can't think it is, well,
9385840	9388520	it does seem like we think contradictions all the time.
9388520	9390400	You can reason with them.
9390400	9394520	So now Hegel definitely is not a you cannot think a contradiction
9394520	9398560	person, because the logic is just full of contradictions.
9398560	9400480	And it's all thinking.
9400480	9405080	But nor is he merely a don't do it, because that's too weak.
9405080	9410200	And the logic is not built on, oh, you should keep doing this.
9410200	9413800	The forward movement of the phenomenology and the logic
9413800	9415600	are not a normative one.
9415600	9419760	You're a bad person if you don't keep reading.
9419760	9423720	So he seems to have a third view, which is contradictions
9423720	9430480	are thinkable, but thought as such must strive to resolve.
9430480	9433640	It cannot rest content with a contradiction.
9433640	9437640	It has to try to go beyond the contradiction.
9437640	9441600	And the reason this is relevant is because there
9441600	9445480	are people who read, so we'll talk about this when we get
9445480	9447600	to the logic, there are people who
9447600	9449560	think there are true contradictions.
9449560	9452200	They're called dialytheists, because they
9452200	9459080	think something can be both true and false.
9459600	9463920	That can be true, that p is both true and false.
9463920	9467840	And Hegel is one of their main historical supports.
9467840	9470600	You can read Hegel as a dialytheist,
9470600	9474360	because he says dialytheist friendly things all the time.
9474360	9478160	The problem is if Hegel thinks that contradictions are true,
9478160	9482160	when we get to contradictions, why do we have to move beyond them?
9482160	9484560	The problem with the dialytheist is
9484560	9488200	they don't have a sufficient, for Hegel,
9488200	9490360	a sufficiently strong justification of why we,
9490360	9492560	when we get to a contradiction, we don't just go, oh,
9492560	9494800	interesting fact, contradiction.
9494800	9498480	What they will say is you want to minimize contradictions,
9498480	9501480	because the more contradictions you have,
9501480	9503280	the more messed up your logic is.
9503280	9505640	So the basic idea of dialytheist logic
9505640	9508440	is you can have a non-trivial logic that
9508440	9509840	has true contradictions in it.
9509840	9511440	You just have various logical methods
9511440	9513520	of constraining, localizing the contradictions.
9513520	9515600	So there's a contradictory subject matter here,
9515600	9516920	but as long as you're sufficiently far away
9517000	9519400	from that subject matter, you don't have to contradict yourself.
9519400	9523040	But the problem is that involves a basically pragmatic approach
9523040	9526080	to logic, which is totally acceptable in contemporary
9526080	9528320	philosophy, but it's totally an alphabet of Hegel's whole way
9528320	9529440	of doing philosophy.
9529440	9531800	What we're trying to do in hand-making philosophy
9531800	9536400	is not like, find the best overall plausible view
9536400	9538600	compatible with our starting positions.
9538600	9539240	No.
9539240	9541080	We're trying to totally systematically
9541080	9544520	from a completely indeterminate presuppositionless starting
9544520	9546520	point unfold all the philosophy.
9546520	9548680	So we need a more systematic explanation
9548680	9551600	of why, when we get to a contradiction,
9551600	9553680	we're not just happy with that.
9553680	9557320	And I mean, this is a very huge topic in Hegel.
9557320	9558880	It will occupy us at various points
9558880	9560120	over the course of the semester.
9560120	9562320	I think it's just internal that Hegel's conception
9562320	9566480	is that thinking strives to overcome a contradiction,
9566480	9568680	and thinking is not in agreement with itself.
9568680	9573720	It's not fully thinking, except insofar as it
9573720	9576760	overcomes contradiction.
9576760	9577640	OK.
9577640	9583440	I think that is going to be it for today.
9583440	9585320	I'll set some reading notes for next week.
9585320	9587320	There's a lot of reading on the syllabus for next week.
9587320	9589560	It'll take me two weeks to get through all of it,
9589560	9594880	try to read absolute knowing, and then experience gratitude.
9598280	9600280	We're not reading the whole phenomenology.
9603720	9604220	Yeah.
9604220	9605200	We'll go back.
9605200	9606200	We'll go back.
9606200	9608680	We'll read the whole phenomenology.
9608680	9609160	Yeah.
9609160	9610140	I think it's good.
9610140	9610640	Yeah.
9610640	9611140	Yeah.
9611140	9612140	I think it's good.
9612140	9612640	Yeah.
9612640	9613140	It's good.
9613140	9613640	Yeah.
9613640	9614140	It's good.
9614140	9614640	It's good.
9614640	9615120	It's good.
9615120	9615620	It's good.
9615620	9616120	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9616120	9616620	Yeah.
9616620	9617120	Yeah.
9617120	9617620	Yeah.
9617620	9618120	Yeah.
9618120	9618620	Yes.
9618620	9619120	Thank you.
9619120	9621120	Thank you for showing questions.
9621120	9622120	Oh, OK.
9622120	9624120	One, two, three.
9624120	9624620	OK.
9624620	9626620	Mr. Brown said that it's OK.
9626620	9627120	OK.
9627120	9627620	Thank you.
9627620	9628620	It's not that it's OK.
9628620	9629120	It's OK.
9629120	9629620	Yeah.
9629620	9630120	It's OK.
9630120	9631620	Yes.
9631620	9633120	It's not really about politics anymore.
9634020	9636020	It's about transformation.
9636020	9636520	It's about transformation.
9636520	9637020	Yeah.
9637020	9637520	Yeah.
9637520	9639520	We'll just do it on the conference.
9639520	9640520	There you go.
9640520	9642020	There you go.
9642020	9642520	Yeah.
9642520	9643020	Good.
9643020	9643520	Thank you.
9643520	9644040	Thank you.
9644040	9644520	Thank you.
9644520	9646020	We have your photos of it.
9646020	9646520	OK.
9646520	9647020	Thank you.
9647020	9647520	Thank you.
9647520	9648020	Thank you.
9648020	9648520	Thank you.
9648520	9649020	OK.
9649020	9650020	You're out of the park.
9650020	9652020	No, we're not in the park.
9652020	9655020	Oh, my family's not here.
9655020	9655520	Hello.
