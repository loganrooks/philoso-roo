0	5320	So let me say a few things about the idea of this class.
5320	11040	So Hegel has always suffered from the problem
11040	13280	that he is very hard to teach.
13280	15640	And the reason he is very hard to teach
15640	18920	is because there is no book by Hegel
18920	23120	that is the equivalent of the critique of pure reason,
23120	28120	or the ethics of Spinoza, or the Republic of Plato,
28240	31800	or Truth is a Human Nature.
31800	34560	That is to say, a single book that you
34560	36920	could teach either in the course of a semester,
36920	40000	or you could teach a significant chunk of a semester,
40000	44120	that gives you, if not the philosopher's whole system,
44120	48960	at least enough of it that you can kind of figure out
48960	52480	how everything fits into it.
52480	57200	The closest thing in Hegel would be the philosophy of right.
57200	61640	But that is really only a very small part of Hegel's system.
61640	65040	The books by Hegel that do contain a more complete
65040	67640	presentation of the system have this problem
67640	71520	that they are unbelievably hard to read,
71520	74240	in particular this one, the Phenomenology of Spirit.
74240	77560	So the standard way that Hegel gets
77560	79760	taught at the undergraduate class
79760	82960	is you teach the Phenomenology of Spirit.
82960	86080	So in the past when I've taught this class,
86080	88200	I have done the standard thing.
88200	90320	You try to read the Phenomenology of Spirit.
90320	92960	The problem with that is that in one semester,
92960	96480	you can only really do half of the Phenomenology.
96480	98640	I never managed to get to the end.
98640	102000	And the Phenomenology of Spirit is, I think,
102000	105960	the hardest book in the entire Western philosophical tradition.
105960	109880	So what has this experience teaching the Phenomenology
109880	112360	of Spirit that, at a certain point, people aren't really
112360	113920	reading the book anymore.
113920	117280	They're just kind of getting a kind of indirect high level
117280	118720	summary of it.
118720	120960	And they're kind of talking about Hegel,
120960	123480	but they're not really talking about what's in the book.
123480	124960	And that's not just true of students
124960	126160	in undergraduate classes.
126160	128520	On Hegel, I sometimes have the impression
128520	131120	with a lot of so-called Hegel scholars
131120	133840	that they're not really reading the same book that I am.
133840	137000	They're kind of like doing this second hand high level
137000	137880	summary of Hegel.
137880	142280	So the last time I taught 316, I went the opposite direction.
142280	145840	We read the Phenomenology of Spirit line by line.
145840	148400	In fact, in at least one three hour course,
148400	150960	we didn't get past a single sentence.
150960	155520	That had the contrary benefit that people were really, really
155520	157800	reading the text.
157800	160160	However, it had the complementary problem
160160	162120	that we didn't get very far.
162120	165520	And after a certain point, even if you're
165520	168280	reading it sentence by sentence, Hegel
168280	170680	is extraordinarily difficult.
170680	175320	So this class is going to go in the opposite direction.
175320	179280	The idea of this class is that we're going to do,
179280	184440	or I'm going to present, the entirety of Hegel's system,
184440	185640	or at least not the whole thing.
185640	187400	You can't do the whole thing one semester.
187400	190680	I'm going to talk about all of the main structural moments
190680	191920	of Hegel's system.
191920	194880	And I'll talk about this in more detail, a little bit more
194880	200040	detail later today, and much more detail in several weeks.
200040	202600	We're going to talk about the Phenomenology of Spirit, which
202600	207280	is the introduction to the system, which has three parts,
207280	210760	logic, philosophy of spirit.
214920	218440	Sorry, I really should bring my notes with me.
218440	222760	Philosophy of nature, that's an embarrassing mistake.
222760	223920	The philosophy of spirit.
223920	229640	So we're obviously not going to read every part.
229640	234040	The book that presents this whole thing is called the Psychopedia.
234040	236800	We're not going to read the entire Encyclopedia.
236800	238240	That would be ridiculous.
238240	241040	But we're going to talk about all of the main structural moments
241040	241920	of this.
241920	245560	So we're going to spend the first two weeks on the Phenomenology
245560	246640	of Spirit.
246640	251680	We're going to spend three, four, five, six, from weeks three
251680	253840	to six on the logic, which means we're
253840	256800	going to talk about the beginning.
256800	259360	And we're going to talk about the end.
259360	261840	And then we're going to spend a week on the transition
261840	263440	to the philosophy of nature.
263440	265400	Then we're going to spend a week talking
265400	268480	about the move from the philosophy of nature
268480	270080	to the philosophy of spirit.
270080	276160	And then we're going to spend one week on the philosophy of right.
276160	277800	It's week nine.
277800	281640	We're going to spend, I feel like I've missed a week somewhere
281640	282140	in here.
282140	283560	This is not quite accurate.
283560	285960	But you get the basic picture.
285960	295400	And then we're going to spend one week on art, one week on religion,
295400	299400	and then one week on philosophy, which
299400	302600	is the return of the philosophy of spirit back to the logic.
302600	305720	So we're not going to cover every single part of the system.
305720	309600	But we are going to talk about all the major moving parts.
309600	314560	So the other idea that sort of mixed in with this idea for this course
314560	318360	is we're going to read all the parts of Hegel you can just read.
318360	320800	We're going to read all the easy parts of it.
320800	322760	And we're going to read them in systematic order
322760	326360	so that you have some idea of what Hegel's philosophical system actually
326360	326960	is.
326960	331120	The other problem with reading the phenomenology of spirit,
331120	334200	the other problem with treating the phenomenology of spirit
334200	337120	as like the textbook for an undergraduate Hegel course,
337120	342240	is I'll talk about this more later today and more next week.
342240	344840	The phenomenology of spirit is in a certain way,
344840	349400	although this requires qualifications, only Hegel's negative view.
349400	353000	It should bear the subtitle wrong answers only.
353000	357240	So the phenomenology of spirit is a series of failed attempts,
357240	359880	failed accounts of what knowledge is.
359880	364600	So it's just very weird that this book has become treated
364600	367440	as the critique of pure reason of Hegel.
367440	371200	That is just, I mean, Hegel would be totally shocked
371200	373160	that this is the book that everyone reads,
373160	376720	because it's basically his jubinellia.
376720	379320	And he wasn't even really sure what to do with it
379320	382160	once he had completed the mature system, which is this.
386160	387400	OK.
387400	391960	So that's the idea of what you've gotten yourself into.
391960	392920	OK.
392920	394360	Some course mechanics.
394360	397240	The syllabus is on Quercus.
397240	398800	I will just say a few things about it.
398800	400800	I find discussing course mechanics in the beginning
400800	402720	of the semester really boring.
402720	404280	So I'm going to do this very quickly.
404280	407520	You have to write two essays, and there is a final exam
407520	409480	during the exam period.
409480	413080	The, you know, it couldn't be more straightforward.
413080	414280	OK.
414280	416920	Your participation grade will be determined
416920	420160	on the basis of how many weeks you submit questions
420160	421400	about the reading.
421400	423160	So the questions about the reading should be written.
423160	425160	You can type them if you want, but it's also
425160	426720	fine to submit them just handwritten,
426720	429160	as long as your handwriting is legible.
429160	431680	And they should be questions about the reading for that week.
431680	435400	And not, you know, like, I was an undergraduate too once.
435400	437000	I know all the tricks, right?
437000	439640	So not like you just turn to a random page in the reading,
439640	442400	and you find Hegel saying, the study of philosophy
442400	445120	is hindered by the conduct of only clever argumentation.
445120	447160	Why does Hegel say the, you know,
447160	449360	that's not what I'm looking for.
449440	451520	You know, put, like, say a little bit more
451520	455280	about why this question is relevant or contextualize it.
455280	457440	Given that Hegel says this, and he says this other thing,
457440	458520	how is this compatible?
458520	461400	Why does Hegel think that this transition is unproblematic?
461400	463160	Why is this argument supposed to be good?
463160	464160	How is this consistent?
464160	464960	Something like that.
464960	465920	Two for every week.
465920	466480	OK.
466480	469040	So some of you probably, how many of you
469040	471120	brought reading questions for this week?
471120	472120	OK, good.
472120	473360	That's great.
473360	475120	A lot of you joined the class later,
475120	476640	didn't know about this, so I'm going
476640	478200	to treat those as extra credit.
478280	480120	You can hand them, you can give them to me
480120	481440	at the end of the day.
481440	483800	But in general, they're due first thing.
483800	485840	So you know, this is like, don't show up
485840	488240	and think you can scribble a few questions about the reading
488240	489560	and grab total credit for it.
489560	490920	That's not going to work.
490920	491800	OK.
491800	497560	Other than that, how many of you here are auditing this class?
497560	498440	OK.
498440	499840	That's a lot.
499840	501200	That's like an insane number.
501200	501720	OK.
501720	504160	So let me just say, those of you who
504160	506720	are taking this class for credit,
506720	510720	you have something of great value that other people want,
510720	512760	which means you have to earn it.
512760	515760	So do your best work.
515760	518480	Because if you don't do your best work,
518480	521400	I would prefer that you just drop the class
521400	523760	and one of the people who's auditing it take your spot.
523760	526280	Because many of them are very, very motivated.
526280	528560	OK.
528560	533480	Let me say one or two things more.
533480	536000	Why is Hegel relevant, or why is Hegel important?
536000	539480	Why should you spend the amount of energy
539480	543720	that you're going to have to expend this semester on Hegel?
543720	545960	I mean, the other reason that I've designed this class
545960	548360	is I wanted to finally teach a Hegel class that
548360	551320	wasn't impossibly difficult.
551320	553840	This is supposed to be like moderate level difficulty
553840	554600	Hegel.
554600	556120	OK.
556120	559520	I mean, for the most part, not a sign of a really impossible
559520	560960	hard things in Hegel.
560960	564440	But there's a few weeks where we are
564440	566960	going to read some really hard stuff in Hegel,
566960	569880	and I will kind of hold your hand through those.
569880	570560	OK.
570560	575640	So I regard Hegel as the philosophical equal,
575640	578680	the peer of Plato and Aristotle.
578680	582520	I think he's the only modern philosopher other than Kant,
582520	585120	who has that kind of status.
585120	588320	In a more generous mood, or if Tariq Dicco were here,
588320	591040	I would include Heidegger.
591080	594440	But, and Hegel has had an enormous influence
594440	598320	on European philosophy, the Western philosophy,
598320	599800	after that.
599800	602800	But always, I think, in a distorted form.
602800	606160	That is to say, the Hegel that was taken up
606160	610560	and was influential in philosophy after that
610560	615440	was always in one way or another distorted version of Hegel.
615440	618520	So that, in a certain way, the true Hegel
618520	621320	remains to be understood and really
621320	624160	philosophically appreciated.
624160	627320	Which also makes reading Hegel very exciting,
627320	631360	because there's more work to be done in understanding Hegel,
631360	633400	not just exegetically, but philosophically,
633400	635600	than there is with any other comparably
635600	640400	important modern philosophy, even Kant, especially Kant.
640400	644880	Kant is, in a certain way, relatively well understood,
644880	646960	vastly better understood than Hegel.
646960	650280	And Hegel has only himself to blame for this.
650280	654600	The books are, aside from the philosophy of right,
654600	660120	extraordinarily kind of maddeningly difficult.
660120	662920	Sometimes read as though they are.
662920	665800	So Hegel has a reputation, especially
665800	669400	in the English language tradition,
669400	673800	of just being an author of Gable de Gug of gibberish.
673800	674720	That's not true.
674720	678200	That reflects more on the readers who say that,
678200	680000	or that he's some kind of mystic.
680000	681840	Also, that's just a simple misreading.
681840	687480	But the books are forbiddingly difficult and dense.
687480	689440	There are significant chunks.
689440	693040	I mean, I've spent so much time reading these books.
693040	696200	I'm on my second read.
696200	698480	I read the Phonology of Spirit cover to cover
698480	700440	with some friends, and then I immediately
700440	701880	started rereading it from scratch.
701880	705800	And that's my fourth complete read through in my life.
705800	708680	And I'm constantly rereading the Science of Logic.
708680	711640	There are chunks of these books that I just
711640	713840	have to throw my hands around.
713840	717520	I don't really know what's going on.
717520	719880	Now, there's a reason, and we'll see this
719880	721480	over the course of the semester.
721480	724960	It's not just that Hegel was a bad writer, which he wasn't.
724960	728000	So Hegel has this reputation for being a bad writer.
728000	729720	This is simply false.
729720	734120	When Hegel wants to, he can be eloquent, indeed beautiful.
734120	736040	There's actually a philosophical reason
736040	740680	for why the books are written as densely as they are.
740680	744200	I also think part of the reason why some parts of the books
744200	747160	are as dense as they are is because Hegel had not fully
747160	749960	worked out his theory.
749960	753200	He had not fully worked out his system in all of the detail
753200	758160	that he presents it as having been worked out in.
758160	762040	Failures of presentation are often failures of thought.
762040	764320	And I think to some extent, that's
764320	766760	part of what's going on with Hegel in some places.
766760	768920	And also, I think there are philosophical reasons
768920	771880	for why the books have to be written in this way that
771880	775240	is extremely difficult to read.
775240	778920	But because Hegel has, in my view,
778920	782840	never been received as Hegel, that is to say,
782840	785040	the reception of Hegel has always been the distortion
785040	785760	of Hegel.
785760	788480	That makes Hegel exciting.
788480	795000	In a certain way, in other moods,
795000	797640	I would say this more vociferously.
797640	801680	In a certain way, the big, unaccomplished task
801680	804720	of philosophy in Western tradition
804720	807360	is fully understanding and grappling with Hegel.
807360	809960	I think that's the thing that hasn't really been done.
809960	813480	And this class can serve as a kind of introduction
813480	816360	to doing that, and maybe an inspiration to you
816360	817560	to do that further.
817560	821240	Because one of the ways that I hope this class will function
821240	827720	is as a propagutic for you to read more of Hegel
827720	832040	on your own, an entry point in Hegel
832040	834120	so that you can study it more on your own.
834120	837400	OK, there is no textbook for this class.
837400	839760	All of the readings are going to be online
839760	843200	on corkis in the form of PDFs, which
843200	848640	means that if you want to, you can read them on screens.
848640	851200	And that means that I will have to allow laptops
851200	854560	in this class if normally I don't, which I hate doing.
854560	859560	The reason I hate doing that is because these things are just
859560	860920	distraction machines.
860920	863400	So whenever you see a screen, what you should see
863400	867760	is a conspiracy by very rich and powerful people
867760	870360	to destroy your mind and ruin your life,
870360	873080	because that's, in fact, what they are.
873080	877520	They are the great toxin of our contemporary world.
877520	880280	And so I would prefer to not have them in the classroom.
880280	882680	Somehow, all of the best philosophy ever written
882680	885560	was written without them, so we don't actually
885560	887240	need them for any of this.
887240	889400	In fact, all of the best philosophy
889400	894200	was done and taught without artificial light.
894200	896960	So I would really like to someday teach a class.
897600	900080	If you go to old German universities,
900080	902720	if you go to what is now Pumboldo Investitatie
902720	904120	in Berlin, the University of Berlin,
904120	907080	where Hegel is a professor, the Bruins
907080	911040	have these gigantic floor-to-ceiling windows,
911040	914280	because of course, there was no artificial light.
914280	918560	And teaching by candlelight is not really a safe or
918560	919960	particularly practical.
919960	923440	So in fact, we don't even need this horrible fluorescent
923440	926240	or a headlighting that's ugly and destroys,
926240	929080	diminishes the human spirit.
929080	933800	But unfortunately, we are stuck with this institutional setup.
933800	937200	So that was all a way of saying, I encourage you
937200	944800	to print out the reading and read Hegel in print,
944800	949480	because all of the evidence is that you understand
949480	953640	and remember things better when you read them in print.
956240	957920	When you read something on paper,
957920	961040	you have this multimodal sensory experience of it.
961040	962480	It's both tactile.
962480	967000	If it's a pretty old book, it has an olfactory dimension.
967000	968240	You shouldn't taste the books.
968240	970080	You have a gustatory dimension.
970080	973040	But there's all the physical, it's carrying it around.
973040	975960	You develop a physical relationship with your book.
975960	978600	So if you've ever taken a class under critique of pure reason,
978600	983040	by the end of the semester, your critique is like this.
983040	984440	Binding has been destroyed.
984440	986920	It's covered in notations.
986920	988920	And it's like a physically important object to you.
988920	991240	And that physical defecation to the book, I think,
991240	995040	actually improves your learning and reading experience.
995040	998480	Even better would be if you wanted to buy or somehow
998480	1001640	acquire the physical books.
1001640	1003960	But I'm not going to require that because, of course,
1003960	1005800	we're only going to read a little bit of this
1005800	1008240	and then a little bit of the science of logic.
1008360	1010720	If I made you buy the books for all this class,
1010720	1013720	it would be more expensive than I can reasonably expect from you.
1013720	1014600	OK.
1014600	1016200	So that is everything that I'm going
1016200	1019600	to say about course mechanics before we
1019600	1026880	dive into the phenomenology of spirit itself.
1026880	1038200	Let me just say, normally, so GWF Hegel, born in 1770,
1039160	1042600	you need 31, normally the principle
1042600	1045880	in which I operate with respect to historical philosophers
1045880	1048680	is all that we need to say about them is they were born,
1048680	1050880	they worked, and they died.
1050880	1054440	Now, I'm going to slightly violate my own rule
1054440	1057360	because I'm a big fan of the digression.
1057360	1061480	And in being a fan of the digression in the lecture,
1061480	1065560	I have no less eminent of precursor than Hegel himself
1065560	1068440	because in the transcripts of Hegel's lectures, some
1068440	1070280	of which we will read, Hegel's constantly
1070280	1071920	going on these digressions, some of which
1071920	1075840	are totally off topic and some of which are hilarious.
1075840	1079800	He'll talk about some recent play that's been displayed.
1079800	1084320	So a little bit of digression is fun,
1084320	1089760	distracts us from what Hegel calls the rigor of the concept.
1089760	1092880	But occasionally, biographical remarks about Hegel
1092880	1095000	will actually be exegetically relevant.
1095080	1098320	And so I'll say a few things about Hegel's life.
1098320	1098820	OK.
1101760	1104640	This was all that I want to say initially
1104640	1105960	about Hegel's philosophy.
1105960	1109160	I don't like beginning a class by giving
1109160	1111880	this big aerial overview of the philosopher
1111880	1115560	or the philosophical work precisely because it's
1115560	1117040	given purely externally.
1117040	1118800	It's just narration.
1118800	1120720	It's something you could learn from the Stanford
1120720	1125520	Encyclopedia of Philosophy or YouTube.
1125520	1126600	It's not philosophy.
1126600	1128480	It wouldn't be philosophically justified.
1128480	1130240	It wouldn't be doing any philosophy for you.
1130240	1131800	We wouldn't be doing any philosophy together.
1131800	1133320	I'd just be telling you some stuff.
1133320	1140960	So as we'll see, because Hegel takes very seriously
1140960	1144600	the ambition that philosophy should develop everything
1144600	1149000	from itself, it's particularly inappropriate to Hegel
1149000	1152640	to begin with this external just telling you something,
1152640	1154840	mere reports.
1154840	1158720	I would prefer to begin talking about Hegel
1158720	1161280	by doing philosophy in the Hegelian way, which
1161280	1163760	is developing it internally just through thinking something
1163760	1164360	through.
1164360	1166640	So that's all that I want to say initially
1166640	1168360	about Hegel's philosophy.
1168360	1170480	I'll just say one or two things more
1170480	1173640	about what's special about Hegel.
1173640	1177960	Hegel is probably the most ambitious philosopher
1177960	1179360	who's ever existed.
1179360	1182800	So the ambition of Hegel's philosophy
1182800	1186520	is to develop all of this, which is
1186520	1189380	to say a completely systematic epistemology,
1189380	1190960	a completely systematic metaphysics,
1190960	1193400	a completely systematic account of the natural world,
1193400	1196760	a completely systematic account of the mind, which
1196760	1198640	includes a completely systematic account
1198640	1200920	of moral and political philosophy,
1200920	1203760	a completely systematic account of art and its history,
1203760	1206400	a completely systematic account of the history of religion,
1206400	1211880	And true religion, Hegel calls consonant religion,
1211880	1215760	without any presuppositions.
1215760	1218000	That's the most ambitious that I think philosophy has ever
1218000	1218500	gotten.
1218500	1221360	So Hegel is, in a certain way, the person
1221360	1225760	who has the most faith or confidence in philosophy
1225760	1227600	that I can think of.
1227600	1231280	Everyone since Hegel has been more disillusioned
1231280	1232240	about philosophy.
1232240	1234280	Or another way of pointing that point
1234280	1237920	is Hegel is even more than Kant.
1237920	1240720	The person, the philosopher, with the most confidence
1240720	1246520	that reason, just reasoning, can do everything that we want.
1246520	1248680	That it can be completely satisfactory.
1248680	1250480	Reason can be completely self-determinate.
1250480	1253480	Doesn't need anything outside.
1253480	1255440	Everyone in philosophy, since Hegel,
1255440	1258320	has been more pessimistic about the possibility
1258320	1260280	of this complete self-determination
1260280	1261880	of rational thought.
1262880	1265360	Questions about that before we dive
1265360	1267080	into the phenomenology of spirit itself?
1272040	1272540	No?
1272540	1273040	Yeah.
1273040	1273540	Hey.
1273540	1275120	I'm not sure what that's supposed to be,
1275120	1276960	but can I ask something about the question?
1276960	1277960	Sure.
1277960	1279000	The question is this.
1279000	1281040	On the set of us, that's like two, three lines.
1281040	1283800	But you ask us to contextualize it.
1283800	1287080	That would require us to pull up Hegel.
1287080	1289800	But that makes it less space, like one line or two.
1289800	1291800	So by two or three sentence, do you
1291800	1295800	make two or three sentence of a whole world together?
1295800	1302080	You're taking, like, we'll figure it out.
1302080	1307000	Yeah, you're taking a rule of thumb too precisely.
1307000	1308200	Oh, the other thing I want to say
1308200	1312380	is if anyone reads German, I would
1312380	1317800	encourage you to try to read at least some of this in German.
1317800	1321080	The translations vary a great deal in quality.
1321080	1323800	And so one of the themes of this semester
1323800	1325960	that you will probably learn to find really annoying
1325960	1331080	will be complaining about various Hegel translations.
1331080	1332880	I haven't been hard about whether to use this
1332880	1334680	as the textbook for the course.
1334680	1337560	This is the closest thing to a collection
1337560	1339560	of all of the relevant texts that we
1339560	1341000	would read in this class.
1341000	1343880	The reason I decided against it is the translations
1343880	1346500	are, in some cases, very strange.
1346500	1350740	And the selections are, in some cases, I think not ideal.
1350740	1352780	And so then I thought, OK, then they're
1352780	1354860	going to have to listen to me complain, not only
1354860	1358060	about the translations, but also Holgate selections.
1358060	1359820	That will open order the hell out of them.
1359820	1362260	So I'll just make my own selections.
1362260	1364300	Yes?
1364300	1366020	I don't know if it's too early, but I
1366020	1371940	want to know how Hegel connects logic to aesthetics and how.
1371940	1374260	Oh, that's way too early.
1374260	1374940	Way too early.
1374940	1376100	We're not even.
1376180	1378180	We don't even know what logic is yet.
1378180	1381220	That's just a word on a blackboard.
1381220	1383740	So using the Cambridge translations.
1383740	1386940	Using the Cambridge translations insofar as it's possible.
1386940	1389500	So the Cambridge translations, the Cambridge Hegel
1389500	1391080	translations, you might think, oh, my god,
1391080	1392380	they're going to translate everything.
1392380	1394380	But they have now translated the phenomenology
1394380	1397580	of spirit, the science of logic, the encyclopedia logic,
1397580	1401900	the Hegel's writings from Heidelberg, and that's it.
1401900	1404100	And so you might think, oh, everything's coming out more.
1404100	1407540	No, Hilary Gaskin, the main philosophy
1407540	1408980	editor at Cambridge University Press,
1408980	1410780	has announced it's complete.
1410780	1412780	That's all they're going to do.
1412780	1414500	And that's all they ever intended to.
1414500	1416820	That is not, in fact, a complete story.
1416820	1420100	In fact, so I'll tell you, at some point
1420100	1422620	when I feel like we need a break,
1422620	1424820	I'll give you the complete backstory about how
1424820	1428260	the Cambridge Hegel translation is so radically incomplete.
1428260	1430300	And it was, of course, never intended to be in complete
1430300	1431100	this way.
1431100	1433660	The short answer is they decided to woefully
1433740	1437340	underpay the editorial order, who all resigned.
1437340	1441020	And then at some point, the new editorial board,
1441020	1442380	some point Cambridge just realized
1442380	1444020	it wasn't worth the money.
1444020	1446660	So we're now in this totally ridiculous situation
1446660	1450460	that there is never going to be, in the foreseeable future,
1450460	1453440	a good, complete translation of the works
1453440	1455500	of Hegel in England.
1455500	1458900	So now, OK, I'll say one other thing.
1458900	1461380	There are two different, there's basically
1461380	1465380	two different editions of the works of Hegel in German.
1465380	1469780	The first one is published by a, is now
1469780	1476660	published by a press in Germany called Zuk.
1476660	1478340	Those are, if you ever see, they're
1478340	1481300	sort of very dark blue paperbacks.
1481300	1486020	That translation goes back to a translation that was made,
1486020	1488620	sorry, an edition that was made immediately
1488620	1492460	after Hegel's death by this group called themselves
1492460	1494140	the Friends of Hegel.
1494140	1496580	Now, the problem with that edition
1496580	1498900	is that it isn't up to contemporary
1498900	1500900	filmological snuff.
1500900	1504620	In particular, with respect to Hegel's lectures,
1504620	1506860	they did this thing that from a contemporary point of view
1506860	1508780	was totally outrageous.
1508780	1512060	People, the people who were editing Hegel's lectures,
1512060	1515940	took all of Hegel's notes and the student transcripts
1515940	1520660	and then composed one sort of condensed version
1520660	1523780	of all of this information and then destroyed,
1523780	1527900	in many cases, the originals so that we can't verify
1527900	1530460	whether their edition was correct.
1530460	1535580	So this was for, this was until the 70s, the only edition
1535580	1538500	of Hegel that there was.
1538500	1545020	Now, after that, there's the Academy edition,
1545020	1547300	where people actually sat down and did
1547300	1549220	the really philologically respectable thing.
1549220	1553100	I mean, the other thing is, for instance, the Friends of Hegel
1553100	1556260	edition only contains one edition of the Encyclopedia.
1556260	1559340	It only contains one edition of the Science of Logic.
1559340	1560980	That, by contemporary philological standards,
1560980	1563740	is radically inadequate.
1563740	1567900	The Academy edition does this much more complete job.
1567900	1570700	But the weird result of that is almost all
1570700	1573300	of the translations of Hegel into English that
1573420	1576060	existed historically are based on this.
1576060	1577460	And so you would think, well, this
1577460	1579260	would be a perfect opportunity for Cambridge
1579260	1581300	to do the English translations from that.
1581300	1583500	But that's not going to happen because they
1583500	1585300	underpaid the editorial board.
1585300	1587140	Also, these editorial board guys,
1587140	1588620	like they're all tenure professors
1588620	1589940	drawing massive salaries.
1589940	1591500	They could just do it for free.
1591500	1594900	But I wouldn't tell that to their face.
1594900	1597740	So the other thing that's weird is,
1597740	1600300	so there are all these people make a big deal about this.
1600300	1602260	They just think, oh, you can never
1602260	1605340	talk about Hegel's lectures from the old Friends of Hegel
1605340	1605860	edition.
1605860	1607900	You have to only cite the Academy edition.
1607900	1611540	But the problem is, almost all of the reception of Hegel
1611540	1613060	through the history of philosophy
1613060	1615700	from his death in 1831 until whenever this was published
1615700	1619100	in the 60s or 70s was based on the old edition.
1619100	1623140	So these poorly edited editions of Hegel's lectures
1623140	1624900	are the things that are really influential.
1624900	1628260	So when people talk about Hegel's philosophy of history,
1628260	1629980	almost everyone who's ever engaged
1629980	1631140	with Hegel's philosophy of history
1631140	1633300	was engaging with the poorly edited edition,
1633300	1634700	including Marx and everyone else.
1634700	1641420	So I think you can't just ignore this one.
1641420	1645660	In many cases, the older edition, the not so good edition,
1645660	1648460	makes the text much more readable and fluent.
1648460	1651220	And so when we come to read some of Hegel's lectures,
1651220	1653220	for instance, his lectures on the philosophy of art,
1653220	1657620	the philosophy of religion, and the history of philosophy,
1657620	1659540	I will assign some of the translations
1659540	1660940	from the older editions because they're
1661020	1661900	just more readable.
1661900	1663980	And they are the things that everyone's been talking about.
1663980	1666100	Ever since, so if you hear someone talking about Hegel
1666100	1667860	and some other book, they're almost certainly
1667860	1668660	talking about this.
1668660	1670300	So what value would it be to you?
1670300	1673620	You're like, oh, well, actually, the Hotho transcript.
1673620	1674340	You don't care.
1674340	1677260	I barely care.
1677260	1677980	OK.
1677980	1679900	Other questions before we start talking
1679900	1682580	about the phenomenology of spirit?
1682580	1683060	Yes.
1683060	1684580	I've heard that three years ago,
1684580	1686900	you called it a people person.
1686900	1690980	That only went through 40 or 50 pages of the phenomenology.
1690980	1691460	Yeah.
1691460	1694140	What would be the content-wise difference
1694140	1696660	between these two persons in terms of yours?
1696660	1701140	More of you will understand what I'm saying in this course.
1701140	1705340	Or no, the problem with that course is, so I got through
1705340	1707540	about, did Siwan tell you that?
1707540	1708020	Yeah.
1708020	1709900	OK.
1709900	1713180	Siwan likes that word.
1713180	1713780	So let's see.
1713780	1716460	If I did 50 pages in that class, I got more than that.
1716460	1721060	I got all the way up to maybe sort of skepticism.
1721060	1723300	But I kind of rushed through some of skepticism.
1723300	1726420	So we did maybe like 70 pages.
1726420	1727980	And the problem with that is you just
1727980	1730340	learn in a lot of detail the early moves
1730340	1733180	of the phenomenology of spirit, which doesn't tell you.
1733180	1738340	That basically taught people 10% of this.
1738340	1745380	This is 10% of this weird, immature, semi-juvenalia
1745380	1746660	introduction to Hegel system.
1746660	1747860	It's not Hegel system.
1747860	1748380	OK.
1748380	1750820	But to say more about why just teaching
1750820	1755140	the phenomenology of spirit would be so inadequate,
1755140	1757180	I mean, certainly this version of 360
1757180	1761380	is an elaborate apology for the last time I taught 360.
1761380	1763220	Let's just dive into the text.
1763220	1766340	So if you do not have a copy of the text,
1766340	1769060	rearrange yourself so that you are sitting next to someone
1769060	1771900	who does have a copy of the text.
1771900	1774700	So I'll give you a few minutes to do that.
1774700	1776620	So if two of you are sitting next to each other
1776620	1784380	and you have copies of the text, yeah, sorry, what?
1784380	1787420	Yeah, I mean, there'll be some differences.
1787420	1789300	But you'll basically know what's going on.
1796300	1799580	Is anyone in a Hegel island isolated
1799580	1803740	from any other copy of the text?
1803740	1805860	I would have brought additional copies of the text
1805860	1807060	if I had thought of that.
1807060	1809340	Yeah, no screen.
1809340	1811900	OK.
1811900	1816500	It is a natural supposition that in philosophy,
1816500	1820740	before one gets down to dealing with what is that issue,
1820740	1825060	namely the actual cognition of what in truth is.
1825060	1828620	So the issue of philosophy is actually
1828620	1831180	cognizing what in truth is.
1831180	1836860	Now, there's two words here in German, erkenen and bissen.
1839740	1843900	Pinker has, in almost all cases, translated erkenen
1843900	1850980	has to cognize, and bissen has to know.
1850980	1855820	But he's, now there is a difference between erkenen
1855820	1858100	and bissen in Hegel.
1858100	1862020	But erkenen and bissen are both totally ordinary words
1862020	1864460	in German for knowledge.
1864460	1868820	So epistemology in German is referred to as erketnesteri,
1868820	1870380	the theory of erketens.
1870380	1873060	That's the noun for erketens.
1873060	1877020	So it would be totally fine to translate both of them
1877020	1878460	as knowledge.
1878460	1881500	But Pinker has decided to just mark in English
1881500	1883100	a distinction in the German.
1883100	1887180	So it would be totally fine if we read this as saying,
1887180	1889500	before one gets down to dealing with what is at issue,
1889500	1893780	namely the actual knowledge, actually knowing what is true.
1893780	1895580	So now, Hegel uses the difference
1895580	1899300	between bissen and erkenen to mark some kind of difference.
1899300	1901700	But it isn't super crucial right now.
1901700	1904460	So we can also just read cognition here as knowledge.
1904460	1907020	It is a natural supposition that in philosophy,
1907020	1910020	before one gets down to dealing with what is at issue,
1910020	1913060	namely the actual knowledge of what in truth is.
1913060	1914980	So the business of philosophy is actually
1914980	1917340	knowing what in truth is.
1917340	1921260	So not potentially knowing or kind of knowing or having faith,
1921260	1926820	but knowing and knowing what is true, what is actually true.
1926820	1929860	It is first necessary to come to an understanding
1929860	1932460	about knowledge, which is regarded
1932460	1936620	as the instrument by which one seizes hold of the absolute
1936620	1940540	or as the means by which one catches sight of it.
1940540	1942660	So the first word you should stumble over here
1942660	1944220	is the absolute.
1944300	1948180	So the absolute is this major topic
1948180	1954420	and preoccupation of German philosophy from Kant to Hegel.
1954420	1956940	So in the context in which Hegel is writing this,
1956940	1960380	roughly Jena in 1807, the absolute
1960380	1962860	is the thing everyone cares about.
1962860	1966060	But I want to put the absolute aside for a moment,
1966060	1970180	because this is kind of provisional.
1970180	1972180	Over the course of today, you'll understand better
1972180	1973620	what I mean by this.
1974500	1977180	Hegel won't, in the introduction to the phenomenology,
1977180	1980100	yet have an argument that the topic of philosophy
1980100	1983100	should be the absolute, or that what the topic of knowledge
1983100	1984540	is is the absolute.
1984540	1988020	He, over the course of the phenomenology and the logic,
1988020	1989180	will develop that.
1989180	1992780	So this is a foreshadowing of something
1992780	1994580	that you usually have to argue for,
1994580	1997180	although his audience in 1807 would assume, of course,
1997180	2000020	what we really wanted to have knowledge of is the absolute.
2000020	2001820	So what the absolute is, I'm going
2001820	2004860	to set aside until we see Hegel's view of the absolute.
2004860	2007860	But if you need a sort of precursor,
2007860	2010500	you can think of it as God a little bit better.
2010500	2013500	You can think of it as the unconditioned in Kant.
2013500	2017540	A little bit better, you can think of it as Spinoza's God.
2017540	2023540	Even better, you could think of it as Spinoza's God,
2023540	2025660	where Spinoza's God is understood neither
2025660	2028860	determinately as a subject or as an object.
2028860	2032060	And if that sounds very weird, that's fine.
2032060	2034820	We'll come back to it.
2034820	2038420	So the important thing about paragraph 73,
2038420	2039740	the beginning of the introduction,
2039740	2044780	is Hegel is playing off various tropes in modern philosophy.
2044780	2047020	So when you read the beginning of the introduction
2047020	2049260	of phenomenology, you should think of the beginning
2049260	2051700	of Locke's essay, concerning the understanding,
2051700	2053860	or the beginning of conscripti capuris.
2053860	2055900	The characteristic move of modern philosophy
2055900	2058700	is before we investigate the object,
2058780	2061260	we have to investigate the cognitive powers
2061260	2062660	of the subject.
2062660	2065900	So what Hegel does now is then riff on various tropes
2065900	2068500	in modern philosophy.
2068500	2073460	So he's presenting this thing that you would normally assume.
2073460	2075340	It is a natural supposition.
2075340	2077300	Although we'll see that in a certain way,
2077300	2078940	Hegel doesn't share this supposition.
2078940	2080700	He's distancing himself from this supposition.
2080700	2082420	So the natural supposition is, before we
2082420	2085140	go about the business of knowing objects,
2085140	2089340	we first have to investigate the power of the knowledge
2089340	2089840	itself.
2089840	2091620	We have to know what knowledge is.
2091620	2095260	So he then riffs on various metaphors
2095260	2098260	that you find in early modern philosophy.
2098260	2102660	For one, there might be one rather than another form
2102660	2104700	of cognition that is better suited to achieving
2104700	2105380	this final end.
2105380	2108860	So the idea is, well, you have to decide,
2108860	2111740	is it the senses that give us knowledge of what is?
2111740	2113260	Or is it the intellect?
2113260	2114860	Or is it reason if there's a difference
2114860	2116220	between the intellect and reason?
2116220	2118220	Is it faith that gives us knowledge of what is?
2118220	2120540	So those are the kinds of issues that he's gesturing.
2123020	2126340	If cognition is a faculty of a determinant kind and scope,
2126340	2128100	then without a more precise determination
2128100	2130940	of its nature and limits, one ends up grasping clouds of error
2130940	2132500	rather than the heaven of truth.
2132500	2135420	So if knowledge is a particular human ability
2135420	2137780	among other abilities, then there
2137780	2140700	are things that that ability can be exercised with respect to
2140700	2142940	and things that it cannot be exercised with respect to.
2142940	2145220	So we have to get clarity on that before we
2145220	2148060	try to go about knowing objects.
2148060	2149980	If cognition is the instrument for seizing hold
2149980	2152620	of the absolute, then we don't get the absolute
2152620	2155060	as it is in itself, but we form and change.
2155060	2158860	So the idea of, if cognition is something like a tool,
2158860	2162460	then what it gets us is not the object in itself,
2162460	2165540	but the object introverse that's shaped by the tool.
2165540	2167660	So once again, these are not things
2167660	2170900	I think Hegel needs to put a lot of argumentative weight on.
2170900	2174980	What he's doing is pointing out that these standard moves
2174980	2179380	in modern epistemology bring with them these kinds of thoughts.
2179380	2184460	And he's raising this as a way you could begin in philosophy,
2184460	2186460	but then also distancing himself by them
2186460	2190940	by pointing out that those kinds of moves in modern philosophy
2190940	2195380	bring with them very familiar concerns about whether we'll
2195380	2198580	ever be able to know reality as it is in itself.
2198580	2200620	Most importantly, in 1807, the thing that's
2200660	2205460	always in the back of Hegel's mind is Kant and the idea
2205460	2208620	that Kant's investigation to the powers of human mind
2208620	2211220	in the critique of pure reason winds up
2211220	2214740	proving that we don't know reality as it is in itself.
2214740	2217220	So he's riffing on all these various thoughts
2217220	2221900	that if you begin by investigating knowledge
2221900	2227660	itself, you'll always wind up being distanced from the object
2227660	2230460	as it is in itself.
2230580	2233180	Likewise, if we think of knowledge as a passive medium,
2233180	2235740	well, if you really think through the idea of a passive medium,
2235740	2239580	a medium kind of changes what passes through it.
2239580	2241420	And so then you can kind of remove.
2241420	2251580	So the metaphor is, well, if it's a medium changes,
2251580	2253380	the light passes into glass.
2253380	2255140	There's an angle of refraction.
2255140	2261500	So if we know this, maybe we can infer exactly where
2261500	2263020	the thing came from.
2263020	2265100	But then all we'll know is the direction
2265100	2267140	from which the ray came from.
2267140	2272860	So Hegel is just riffing on standard metaphors
2272860	2274980	about knowledge in modern philosophy
2274980	2277980	and very familiar reasons for thinking
2277980	2280780	that if you think of knowledge that way,
2280780	2282860	you will wind up with a conclusion
2282860	2285460	that you don't know reality as it is itself,
2285460	2287300	you know it only as it appears to you,
2287300	2290740	or you know it only in relation to the human mind,
2290740	2291580	et cetera, et cetera.
2291580	2292060	Yeah.
2292060	2298940	So how much we have prior knowledge of the world,
2298940	2303140	and how he gets to the absoluteness?
2303140	2308380	Is it relative to us, or is it universal?
2308380	2310860	We're way too early to get there.
2310860	2314100	We're at super, super preliminary steps here.
2314100	2316940	So now I'm going to just, because this is not the last time
2316940	2319060	I'm on 2016 where I only got 370 pages,
2319060	2321060	I'm not going to go through sentence by sentence.
2321060	2323260	I'm going to jump through to particular passages
2323260	2326060	that I think are eliminated.
2326060	2330660	So then paragraph 74 begins, and he says, well, look,
2330660	2339300	if this we could just as well, so let me just read this passage.
2339300	2341660	If the common concern about falling into error
2341660	2344660	sets up a mistrust of science, which itself,
2344660	2347900	untroubled by such scruples, simply sets itself to work
2347900	2350020	and actually cognizes it, it is still
2350020	2352140	difficult to say why on the contrary,
2352140	2355380	a mistrust of this mistrust should not be set up,
2355380	2357180	and why one should not be concerned
2357180	2361420	that this fear of erring is already the error itself.
2361420	2364500	So what he's pointing out is the things that
2364500	2367580	get us into a mistrust or skepticism
2367580	2371020	about our ability to know are themselves something
2371020	2373020	that we could be skeptical about.
2373020	2376660	In particular, we don't have to assume
2376660	2382140	that knowledge is an instrument or a tool or a passive media
2382140	2386380	or one ability among others, that those themselves,
2386380	2390540	those standard assumptions that structure modern epistemology
2390540	2393340	and that lead to the conclusion that we don't know realities
2393420	2398980	of itself are themselves something that is questionable.
2398980	2403660	Skipping a little bit, but above all, this picture
2403660	2406580	that he's been somewhat satirically riffing on
2406580	2410580	presupposes that the absolute stands on one side
2410580	2413780	and that cognition stands on the other or itself
2413780	2416820	and separated from the absolute, though cognition is
2416820	2418660	nevertheless something real.
2418660	2420980	So what he's saying is the assumption here
2420980	2425940	in all of this stuff, let's just once again, for now,
2425940	2430020	treat the absolute as the object of knowledge.
2430020	2437900	The assumption is I'm over here, the object is a distinct being,
2437900	2445020	and then somehow I have to overcome this distinctness
2445020	2446740	in order to know.
2446740	2448620	And the standard early modern thought
2448620	2452900	is, well, how could I know an object that's distinct for me?
2452900	2457420	Well, it would have to affect me, have to affect my senses.
2457420	2459180	And I would have to have some capacity
2459180	2462380	to be affected sensorily by it.
2462380	2466020	And then all of these early modern worries
2466020	2468980	from Locke, Hume, Kant, Descartes, everyone else,
2468980	2475220	arise, namely, would that allow us to know the object as it is
2475220	2477580	or only as it affects us?
2477580	2480380	Would it allow us to know the way the object really is
2480380	2482740	or only as it appears to our senses?
2482740	2487860	So he's pointing out that that very standard picture
2487860	2492300	of knowledge as a particular relation of one being
2492300	2496940	to another, or let's say, a capacity that one being has
2496940	2499860	to know another being or other beings,
2499860	2503140	is itself something we can question.
2503140	2505580	We're not stuck with that.
2505580	2507660	OK.
2507660	2509980	I'm going to skip 73.
2509980	2510940	OK.
2510940	2514980	So now he says, look, instead of fussing around with answers
2514980	2517780	to all of this, that is to say, instead of fussing around
2517780	2523540	with the whole problem space of early modern epistemology,
2523540	2526300	empiricism, rationalism, sensibility, understanding,
2526300	2528920	reason, instead of all of that, instead of fussing around
2528920	2530700	with answers to all of this, it is
2530700	2532940	possible to reject these outright
2532940	2536420	as contingent and arbitrary representations
2536420	2538540	and to regard the affiliated use of words,
2538540	2542100	such as absolute cognition, and also objective and subjective,
2542100	2544020	and countless others, whose meaning is assumed
2544020	2547020	to be generally known as even a kind of deceit.
2547020	2549060	So one thing we can do is step back and say,
2549060	2552900	the meaning of subject, object, cognition, absolutely,
2552900	2555660	they themselves are things that have to be determined.
2555660	2557860	It's not self-evident what these things mean,
2557860	2561980	and it's not self-evident that we have to begin philosophy
2561980	2564220	by assuming a particular meaning of them
2564220	2566660	or a particular set up for epistemology, namely,
2566660	2570620	that one, skipping a little bit.
2570620	2573060	They constitute only an empty appearance
2573060	2575340	of a knowing, which immediately vanishes
2575340	2578860	in the face of the science, which comes onto the scene.
2578860	2579380	OK.
2579380	2582820	So just a little note about language.
2582820	2584220	Bissen is to know.
2587420	2591860	Bissenschaft is science.
2591860	2594980	But that means just etymologically in German,
2594980	2599020	there's a very close connection between Bissen and Bissenschaft.
2599020	2604740	So for now, Hegel has a very distinctive notion
2604740	2606740	of what a Bissenschaft is.
2606740	2608020	He hasn't developed it yet.
2608020	2610580	So let's just take on board the idea
2610580	2615820	that if the aim of philosophy is to know, to have Bissen,
2615820	2618500	the aim of philosophy is to be a Bissenschaft,
2618500	2622460	that is to say, to be a science, a body of knowing.
2622460	2624660	Now, this is unnatural in English
2624660	2626340	because we have two different words.
2626340	2628660	And because we have this, frankly,
2628660	2632100	stupid tendency in English to assume that the word science
2632100	2635340	only applies to the natural sciences.
2635340	2637260	That just doesn't make sense in German.
2637260	2639060	In German, the study of literature
2639060	2641020	is the Tsozwe Bissenschaft, the study of politics
2641020	2643100	is Politische Bissenschaft.
2643100	2647940	Any systematically ordered body of knowledge is Bissenschaft.
2647940	2650460	So the introduction of science at this point
2650460	2653980	is not as arbitrary as it seems, although over the course
2653980	2657140	of the system, we'll get a much, much richer notion of science.
2657140	2660700	So all that Hegel is doing is saying, look,
2660700	2662380	it's standard to begin by assuming
2662380	2666140	that we want in philosophy is knowledge,
2666140	2668740	that is to say, scientific knowing, science,
2668740	2670380	of what actually is.
2670380	2673340	And the standard way we begin is by assuming this.
2673340	2675980	But this leads very quickly by arguments
2676020	2678420	that are familiar from early modern philosophy
2678420	2681140	to the conclusion that we don't know objects
2681140	2682260	as they are in themselves.
2682260	2686380	We only know their appearances or other structural features.
2686380	2688700	Or even more radically, in Hume, in some way,
2688700	2691020	we don't really know anything other than our own impressions
2691020	2693300	of objects.
2693300	2696660	But we don't have to assume that because it's not obvious
2696660	2699340	what any of these terms mean.
2699340	2700660	OK.
2700660	2703540	But then he says, all of this vanishes
2703540	2704860	when science comes on the scene.
2704860	2709340	So when someone who has scientific knowing,
2709340	2712300	who knows what, in actuality, is the case,
2712300	2715020	and does so scientifically, when they show up,
2715020	2717860	all of the rest of this is revealed to be deceit.
2717860	2722660	But science, insofar as it comes on the scene,
2722660	2724660	is itself an appearance.
2724660	2728140	Science is coming onto the scene is not yet science
2728140	2731260	as it is carried out and unfolded in its truth.
2731260	2736740	So if I don't have knowledge, I just
2736740	2741220	have various beliefs involving these concepts.
2741220	2744540	I'm just a standard early modern epistemology person.
2744540	2747780	And someone comes on the scene who does have knowing,
2747780	2750700	that's just one more claim to knowledge among others.
2750700	2753700	We don't yet know who has knowledge.
2753700	2756900	Merely, the first appearance of knowing,
2756900	2759180	the first person who knows, doesn't necessarily
2759180	2761100	know that they know.
2761100	2763820	So Hegel goes on to say, for with regard
2763820	2765980	to a knowing that is not truthful,
2765980	2769700	science cannot simply reject it as just a common view of things
2769700	2772420	while giving out the assurance that it is itself
2772420	2774620	a completely different kind of cognition
2774620	2777060	and that the other knowing counts as absolutely nothing
2777060	2779260	for science.
2779260	2782620	Skip the rest of the sentence, through such an assurance,
2782620	2785420	science declares its being to be its power.
2785420	2788540	But untrue knowing, just as much appeals to the fact
2788700	2793100	that it is, and it gives out the assurance that science counts
2793100	2796820	as nothing to it, but one bear assurance
2796820	2798500	is just as valid as another.
2798500	2800300	So bear assurance is the old translation.
2800300	2802540	It just sounds better.
2802540	2803820	It's perfectly fine.
2803820	2804780	So what does that mean?
2804780	2809620	What it means is, if you don't know but have mere opinion,
2809620	2816380	and I come on the scene and I know,
2816380	2821220	my assertion that I know is worth just as much
2821220	2826260	as your assertion that you know, even if I know.
2826260	2830860	So the issue here is how we know what knowledge is,
2830860	2835180	or how we justify our epistemic standard.
2835180	2839740	So the issue is not knowledge of objects.
2839740	2842580	It's knowledge of what knowledge is.
2842580	2846780	So the idea is, it's not enough simply to know,
2846780	2850380	because your claim to know is just a mere assertion,
2850380	2854980	a bear assurance, just as valid and just as invalid
2854980	2858980	as the person who doesn't actually know their claim to know.
2858980	2861020	So we need to find somewhere to adjudicate
2861020	2866660	between the mere claim to knowledge, mere opinion,
2866660	2868420	and knowledge.
2868460	2871940	So knowing is agreement?
2871940	2873260	Argument?
2873260	2874180	Agreement.
2874180	2875740	Agreement, no.
2875740	2877500	OK.
2877500	2879260	Skipping a bit, 77.
2879260	2883100	Because this exposition has for its object only
2883100	2885780	knowing as it appears.
2885780	2887420	So what we're going to do is we're
2887420	2889620	going to look at appearances of knowledge.
2889620	2892460	That is to say, claims to know.
2892460	2895660	But once again, we're not interested in particular.
2895660	2899020	I claim to know that Bismarck is the capital of South Dakota.
2899020	2902780	I claim to know that Fargo is not the capital of South Dakota.
2902780	2906420	Maybe someone, some poor, benated, Canadian,
2906420	2910900	ignorant of the geography of the Upper Midwest, my homeland,
2910900	2914980	might claim to know falsely that Fargo is the capital of South
2914980	2915660	Dakota.
2915660	2918300	It is not.
2918300	2920140	We're not interested in that.
2920140	2925420	We're interested in the sort of one level more general
2925500	2930060	about what you think knowledge is.
2930060	2934340	So the exposition has for its object only knowing as it appears.
2934340	2940260	That is to say, appearances of conceptions of knowledge.
2940260	2942340	So you have a conception of what knowledge is.
2942340	2945300	I have a conception of what knowledge is.
2945300	2950580	Even if my conception is right, let's just assume yours is right.
2950580	2953860	My claim about what knowledge is is just as valid as yours.
2953860	2956740	One is just to bear assurance just as much as the other.
2956740	2959180	It does not itself seem to be the science, which
2959180	2963100	is free and self-moving within its own proper shape.
2963100	2967620	So this exposition does not itself seem to be the science.
2967620	2972100	So when Hegel says something doesn't appear or merely appears,
2972100	2973620	that's really important.
2973620	2977340	So he's saying you would think at the beginning
2977340	2979820	this exposition is not going to be science
2979820	2981660	because we don't know what science is yet.
2981660	2983660	We don't know what knowledge is.
2983780	2986820	It will actually turn out to be more complicated than that later on.
2986820	2989500	But let's just take the appearance at face value for now.
2989500	2994420	So this exposition where there's an appearance of knowing
2994420	2997940	is just someone's claim to knowing backed up
2997940	3000540	by some conception of knowledge.
3000540	3002700	That doesn't look to be knowing yet because they
3002700	3004940	don't know that they know.
3004940	3006700	But from this standpoint can instead
3006700	3010540	be taken to be the path of natural consciousness,
3010540	3013300	pressing forward towards true knowing.
3013820	3017420	It can be taken to be the path of the soul wandering
3017420	3019900	through this series of ways it takes shape,
3019900	3023340	as if these were stations put forward in advance to it
3023340	3027900	by its own nature so that it purifies itself into spirit
3027900	3031980	by arriving at a cognition of what it is in itself
3031980	3035420	through the complete experience of its own self.
3035420	3039940	So that description, 77 is a description of this book.
3039980	3044660	It's an exposition, which appears not to be science
3044660	3046780	itself yet, and let's stick with the appearance.
3046780	3050220	Let's assume that this is from the first page not yet science,
3050220	3052740	but merely the appearance of science.
3052740	3056180	But what it really is is it's the path of natural consciousness.
3056180	3057700	So what is natural consciousness?
3057700	3060860	It's something like the conception of knowledge
3060860	3063860	we begin with pre-philosophically.
3063860	3066660	Very roughly, it's this.
3066660	3068900	It's the idea that there's a distinction
3068900	3073380	between consciousness, the subject,
3073380	3076500	and its other, the object, and that consciousness
3076500	3079060	has to somehow overcome that, maybe
3079060	3082300	by the object affecting its senses, et cetera, et cetera.
3082300	3085340	This is natural consciousness.
3090660	3092780	So the exposition, this book is going
3092780	3097820	to be an exposition of the path of natural consciousness
3097820	3102140	pressing forwards towards true known, towards science.
3102140	3104980	Or it can be taken to be the path of the soul wandering
3104980	3107460	through the series of ways it takes shape.
3107460	3109660	So the phenomenology of this will
3109660	3112940	be an exposition of different shapes or forms
3112940	3116940	of consciousness, which means different conceptions
3116940	3119740	of what knowledge is, different conceptions
3119740	3124540	of the relationship between consciousness and its object.
3124540	3127780	As if these were stations put forward in advance to it
3127780	3129340	by its own nature.
3129340	3132420	So these stations, these different forms of consciousness,
3132420	3134380	are not given to it from outside,
3134380	3138460	but they develop out of it itself,
3138460	3141780	so that it purifies itself into spirit
3141780	3145140	by arriving at a cognition of what it is in itself
3145140	3148140	through the complete experience of its own self.
3148140	3151140	So this is going to be the exposition
3151140	3154980	of how natural consciousness becomes spirit,
3154980	3160300	and therefore truly knows itself and has scientific knowledge.
3160300	3162340	Now, what is this exposition?
3162340	3166820	What is the character of the exposition of the phenomenology?
3166820	3170060	So one very standard way of reading the phenomenology
3170060	3173780	that I think is totally wrong is to think of it
3173780	3181740	as an historical description of various shapes of human
3181740	3183100	consciousness over time.
3183100	3185220	So on this reading, some of the beginning of the book
3185220	3187740	is like Stone Age consciousness, and by the end
3187740	3190380	we have like early 19th century German consciousness.
3190380	3193820	This has various problems, one of which
3193820	3196900	is it gets the chronology as out of order.
3196900	3201980	So somehow like Newtonian science comes before the Greeks.
3202180	3203940	There are other problems with it, namely,
3203940	3206020	it makes the whole book completely incoherent.
3206020	3212540	It turns it into the world's most incoherently written
3212540	3214100	piece of intellectual history.
3214100	3218380	It's like Will Durant, as written by Hegel.
3218380	3220100	And it also completely undermines
3220100	3223460	the philosophical account, because what happened does not
3223460	3226020	in and of itself have any necessity.
3226020	3227660	So I don't think that it's historical.
3227660	3229700	I think that this exposition is a purely
3229700	3232300	philosophical or logical.
3232300	3236180	So what we do is we start with natural consciousness, which
3236180	3238220	is a conception of what knowing is.
3238220	3240380	It's roughly this.
3240380	3242540	As we'll see, it's going to start even more minimally
3242540	3243020	than this.
3253420	3255500	We're going to start with this, and then we're
3255500	3259500	going to develop out of this other shapes of consciousness,
3259620	3262540	other conceptions of what knowledge is,
3262540	3267940	till we get to what Hegel identifies as science, what
3267940	3271980	he identifies as the knowing of the absolute,
3271980	3276540	and what he here identifies as consciousness becoming spirit.
3276540	3280620	Now, all of those things are going to be the same.
3280620	3283020	They're all going to be identical.
3283020	3285140	But let me just say something about the latter.
3285140	3287740	What does it mean that consciousness becomes spirit?
3287740	3290460	As Hegel says at the end of 77, it's
3290460	3294620	not that consciousness wasn't spirit and then becomes spirit.
3294620	3298660	It's that consciousness becomes aware of itself as spirit.
3298660	3301420	So one way of thinking about the phenomenology, the one
3301420	3305180	that I'm going to emphasize, is its consciousness developing
3305180	3307660	out of itself a series of shapes of consciousness,
3307660	3310140	conceptions of knowing, until it gets to one
3310140	3313660	that is knowing, full stop.
3313660	3316940	True scientific knowing of what in actuality is.
3316940	3320860	That will turn out also to be knowledge of the absolute.
3320860	3324780	For the preview of incredibly weird Hegel stuff to come,
3324780	3328020	it will turn out that that is the absolute.
3328020	3330580	The absolute is the absolute knowing itself.
3330580	3331860	And you can be part of it too.
3335740	3339020	But the thing I just want to mention now
3339020	3341220	is it will also be consciousness coming
3341220	3344980	to know what it itself is, namely, spirit.
3347300	3350620	Now we're going to talk a lot more about spirit in this class
3350620	3352660	because it's one of the three parts of the system.
3352660	3359060	And we'll spend roughly half this whole semester on spirit.
3359060	3366660	What exactly spirit is in Hegel is if you gave me a pop quiz
3366660	3368980	and gave me a blue book and said you have three hours to say
3368980	3371100	what spirit is for Hegel, I think
3371100	3372660	I would throw myself out of a window.
3372660	3374740	I don't really know how I would do that.
3374740	3380340	But let me just say very briefly something about the word.
3380340	3384660	The word in German is geist.
3384660	3385500	OK.
3385500	3388460	Now, sometimes that gets translated in English
3388460	3392900	as spirit, sometimes it gets translated as mind.
3392900	3394460	So in particular, the translation
3394460	3395960	of the philosophy of spirit that we're
3395960	3399300	going to read, the only one ever published in English
3399300	3402660	because Cambridge underpaid the editorial board,
3402740	3405700	translated as the philosophy of mind.
3405700	3410540	Now, what is the relationship between spirit and mind?
3410540	3413060	They're the same word in German.
3413060	3415580	If you want to say that someone lost his mind in German,
3415580	3418060	you say, he hasein geistfel.
3418060	3422260	So we have two words where the Germans have won.
3422260	3426540	Now, Hegel is exploiting a feature of German, which
3426540	3432220	is that the word that you would use for my individual mind,
3432820	3434740	is also the word that you would use
3434740	3439260	for collective mental phenomena, like the spirit of the age.
3439260	3444660	If you say in English, the mind of the 19th century,
3444660	3446340	people will be like, what?
3446340	3447020	What's that like?
3447020	3448220	That sounds like the board.
3448220	3449940	Everyone in the 19th century was hooked up
3449940	3452420	into some big telepathic worldwide web.
3452420	3457100	Now, if you say zeitgeist, the spirit of the age in German,
3457100	3458300	that sounds totally normal.
3458300	3460460	So what Hegel is playing on the fact
3460460	3464660	that there's one word for individual mental phenomena
3464660	3466380	and collective mental phenomena.
3466380	3469340	Because what he wants us to see is
3469340	3472140	that those aren't really separate things.
3472140	3475660	Not that there's only one mind and we're all parts of it,
3475660	3480060	or that the collective mind is just the combination
3480060	3482220	of the little minds, as Margaret Thatcher famously said,
3482220	3483860	there's no such thing as society.
3483860	3485860	But neither of those views.
3485860	3489860	As always in Hegel, a third weirder thing.
3489860	3493300	But just very briefly, what matters
3493300	3496180	in the phenomenology of spirit is
3496180	3499100	that over the course of the phenomenology,
3499100	3503540	consciousness comes to realize that it's spirit.
3503540	3505780	Consciousness comes to realize that it's a mind.
3505780	3506740	No, no, no.
3506740	3510380	He means spirit in a more technical sense.
3510380	3512540	Consciousness will come to realize
3512540	3516740	that there is no difference between it and its author.
3516740	3521700	Spirit is mind in so far as it understands
3521700	3523780	that it has no other.
3523780	3526780	Now that is not going to mean that everything is spirit.
3526780	3530500	So Hegel's view is not like this is spirit.
3530500	3534660	Hegel's fully aware that there is no spirit on the moon.
3534660	3537740	The view that the phenomenology is building up towards
3537740	3543820	is that the other of spirit, nature, things that have reality
3543820	3547260	but aren't minds, are not fundamentally
3547260	3548940	different from spirit.
3548940	3552420	So that although spirit has another,
3552420	3554860	its other isn't fundamentally other to it.
3554860	3558780	Or it's the same structurally as spirit.
3558780	3560060	Now this is all provisional.
3560060	3562060	All of this is going to be worked out
3562060	3563220	in the rest of the system.
3563220	3567740	But the basic idea is that spirit is consciousness
3567740	3570660	raised to the point where it understands
3570660	3575460	that the basic structure in which consciousness thinks
3575460	3578620	is the same structure as what it thinks about.
3578620	3581660	So although there's a difference between myself and the object,
3581660	3583180	it's not an ultimate difference.
3583180	3587900	The way I think about things is fundamentally the way they are.
3587900	3589660	And what's important for Hegel is
3589660	3591620	that we're going to prove that.
3591620	3593740	We're not going to presuppose it.
3593740	3596900	Hegel's way of thinking about this, preconti and rationalism
3596900	3600700	just presupposes that the categories of thought,
3600700	3603500	basically subject, predicate, and logic,
3603500	3605860	are the metaphysical structure of being.
3605860	3607620	Or they assume something even worse,
3607620	3610500	which is that God just decided, because he's
3610500	3612980	nice, to set things up that way.
3612980	3614500	Because what God really cares about
3614500	3617340	is that we do metaphysics properly.
3617340	3620100	The murder of innocence and the complete slaughter field
3620100	3622740	that is history was relatively different to him.
3622740	3624580	He was figuring out how to create the world.
3624580	3626980	But he was like, wait, if I do it this way,
3626980	3629540	there's going to be all these genocides and all this slavery
3629540	3630620	and all this horrible shit.
3630620	3632740	But they'll be able to do metaphysics.
3632740	3633660	Yes, I'll do that.
3633660	3635980	So Hegel thinks that's even worse.
3635980	3640100	So what we need to do over the course of the system
3640100	3643740	is show that consciousness has to be spirit.
3643740	3646540	That is to say, there can't be a fundamental difference
3646540	3651980	between the categories in which thought thinks and the beings
3651980	3652980	that it thinks about.
3652980	3654860	And so that's going to mean that there's
3654860	3656900	a structural identity between spirit and nature.
3656900	3658180	Yes?
3658180	3660940	The individual mental phenomena,
3660940	3663740	collective mental phenomena, are key names
3663740	3667580	or is it too much experience?
3667580	3669740	You're getting ahead of us.
3669740	3670980	We're not there yet.
3670980	3671940	Yeah, Isaac, right.
3671940	3672740	Yeah.
3672740	3675140	So is there any comparable traits
3675140	3676980	between the non-monetary atmosphere
3676980	3680180	and the non-monology of this technology in 20th century?
3680180	3682740	Is there any connection at all?
3682820	3684340	I will answer that question when we
3684340	3686980	get to a particular passage.
3686980	3690900	Notice the word phenomenology has not been used yet.
3690900	3694140	Maybe a bit naive, but why start with natural consciousness?
3694140	3695660	We will get there.
3695660	3696140	Yeah?
3696140	3698620	What is the concept of what is the notion?
3698620	3702620	Oh, it's the bad old English translation of the concept.
3702620	3704740	To the next question, what is the concept?
3704740	3708460	That's, we will, it's going to take us a couple weeks.
3708460	3709460	But it doesn't use it here.
3709460	3712060	He uses it here, but he uses it in a non-technical sense
3712060	3714460	here to mean something like one's conception.
3714460	3715460	OK.
3715460	3716460	Yeah.
3716460	3719700	I know you said consciousness realizes that it's spirit.
3719700	3724420	Maybe it's a silly question, but what's the difference
3724420	3727260	before we know, before I as a consciousness realize
3727260	3728740	that I am spirit?
3728740	3731780	What is the difference between spirit and consciousness?
3731780	3735220	It's the difference between being something
3735220	3737940	and being aware of yourself as being that.
3737940	3740500	So your spirit all along.
3740540	3742660	Where consciousness is always spirit,
3742660	3745300	but it doesn't grasp itself as spirit.
3745300	3748060	Or I mean, once again, it's important not
3748060	3749980	to think of this temporally.
3749980	3752620	This is not about a guy named consciousness
3752620	3755020	who realizes at the end that he's spirit.
3755020	3756780	It's about consciousness.
3756780	3760380	And consciousness is spirit, but at the level
3760380	3764180	at which we describe consciousness at the beginning,
3764180	3767220	that is not a description of consciousness as spirit.
3767220	3769820	What we're going to do is unfold from that description
3769820	3772100	of consciousness, just from what consciousness is so
3772100	3774460	described that it must be spirit.
3774460	3776140	OK.
3776140	3776900	Moving on.
3776900	3778660	Natural consciousness will prove
3778660	3780860	to be only the concept of knowing,
3780860	3782580	or it will prove to be not real knowing.
3782580	3783100	OK, good.
3783100	3785340	So this is a non-technical use of concept.
3785340	3786740	This is something like what we mean
3786740	3788220	by concept in the ordinary sense.
3788220	3789500	It's a conception of knowing.
3789500	3792500	So natural consciousness thinks of itself as knowing,
3792500	3795100	and it has a conception of knowing, namely this one.
3795100	3797780	But it will prove to be not real knowing.
3797780	3799580	He also said already for that.
3799660	3802940	While it immediately regards itself rather as real knowing,
3802940	3805380	this path has negative meaning for it.
3805380	3807380	And what is the realization of the concept
3807380	3810500	will count instead to it as the loss of itself,
3810500	3814460	for on this path, it loses its truth.
3814460	3816900	In this exposition, consciousness
3816900	3820860	is going to realize that what it thinks knowing is is not
3820860	3821740	knowing.
3821740	3825420	So the truth that it thinks it knows, it doesn't know.
3825420	3827380	This path could accordingly be regarded
3827380	3830220	as the path of doubt, or more properly,
3830220	3832500	as the path of despair.
3832500	3835140	On this path, what happens is not
3835140	3837620	what is customarily understood as doubt,
3837620	3840180	a shaking of this or that supposed truth,
3840180	3842500	followed by the disappearance again of the doubt,
3842500	3845300	and then a return to the former, so that in the end,
3845300	3847940	the thing at issue is taken as it was before.
3847940	3850780	Rather, this path is the conscious insight
3850780	3853540	into the untruth of knowing as it appears.
3853540	3856860	A knowing for which that which is the most real
3856860	3861540	is rather in truth only the unrealized concept.
3861540	3864660	So what that means is consciousness
3864660	3867620	is going to realize, not that it's wrong about it
3867620	3869980	thought it knew something, but it didn't know that thing.
3869980	3872620	It thought it knew that Fargo is the capital of North Dakota,
3872620	3873140	but it isn't.
3876020	3879900	Or it's nor is it going to doubt, it's
3879900	3882860	going to say, well, there's a bunch of stuff I don't know.
3882860	3885300	I don't know anything about how things are in themselves.
3885380	3887060	I didn't know the external world.
3887060	3890860	What it's going to doubt is its conception of knowledge.
3890860	3894900	And that is the loss of itself, because a conception
3894900	3897340	of knowledge is a conception by consciousness
3897340	3899180	of what consciousness is.
3899180	3902420	So in losing that, it loses itself.
3902420	3905180	So there's this kind of existential dimension.
3905180	3908780	These are losses of self-conceptions.
3908780	3913140	So the phenomenology is also an exposition
3913140	3915100	of a sequence of self-conceptions
3915100	3918740	that consciousness might have of itself.
3918740	3920940	I'm going to skip a bunch.
3920940	3923300	So we know where we start, natural consciousness.
3923300	3925740	Although we don't really know what natural consciousness is,
3925740	3927900	this is my preliminary sketch of it.
3927900	3930540	He hasn't really told us what natural consciousness is.
3930540	3933500	We know roughly where things are going to end.
3933500	3938100	They're going to end with scientific knowledge,
3938100	3941500	where whatever doubt is generated
3941500	3943580	about these models of knowledge,
3943580	3945900	that will not be able to be generated anymore.
3945900	3948540	We don't really know why.
3948540	3952140	The completeness of the forms of non-real consciousness
3952140	3954380	will emerge through the very necessity
3954380	3956860	of their progression and their interrelations.
3956860	3959700	The progression of one form of consciousness,
3959700	3961780	one conception of knowledge to another,
3961780	3964700	is going to be necessary, not contingent.
3964700	3966340	To make this comprehensible, it can
3966340	3968620	be noted in general at the outset
3968740	3971540	that the exposition of non-truthful consciousness
3971540	3975220	in its untruth is not merely a negative movement.
3975220	3979020	So Hegel now needs to explain why we transition
3979020	3981660	from one shape of consciousness to the next.
3981660	3986100	Now, rereading the introduction today,
3986100	3989740	I think this is, I came to the conclusion
3989740	3992300	this text is not actually in the best order
3992300	3995740	that it could be in, because only a little bit later
3995780	3999180	will he explain exactly how consciousness
3999180	4001220	undermines a shape of consciousness.
4001220	4002660	But let's set that aside.
4002660	4004620	Let's assume there's some notion of consciousness
4004620	4008420	realizing that its conception of knowledge is wrong.
4008420	4012700	Now we need to understand how it moves to the next one.
4012700	4015340	Now, I just want to emphasize one thing,
4015340	4020180	that this is a process, or this development,
4020180	4022500	is not about particular knowledge claims.
4022500	4024700	We're not interested in particular knowledge
4024740	4026740	claims about particular objects.
4026740	4029220	It's at the level of a whole epistemology,
4029220	4031540	a whole conception of what knowledge is.
4031540	4033380	That's what's getting under it.
4033380	4036260	That's why doubt about that is the loss
4036260	4038340	of consciousness itself.
4038340	4040620	If you find out that you thought you knew
4040620	4042860	that South Dakota was the capital of,
4042860	4045260	sorry, that Fargo was the capital of South Dakota,
4045260	4047180	and then you find out you're wrong,
4047180	4048300	you don't lose yourself in that,
4048300	4049700	unless you have way more invested
4049700	4052900	in the geography of the Upper Midwest than you should.
4052900	4054740	Assuming that we're counting as the Dakotas
4054740	4056420	as part of the Midwest, which, okay,
4056420	4057620	we can debate about that.
4059860	4061500	You guys are probably not as invested
4061500	4063860	in inter-Midwest rivalry as I am.
4065820	4069540	But that's how we learn from each other.
4069540	4073260	Okay, so it's not merely a negative movement.
4073260	4076300	So when consciousness realizes
4076300	4079500	that its conception of knowledge is false,
4079500	4081660	that isn't, it doesn't merely reject it.
4082620	4085100	It's not just like not that.
4085100	4087980	However, only when taken as the nothing
4087980	4092340	of that from which it is, from which it emerges,
4092340	4094940	is the nothing, in fact, the true result.
4094940	4097580	Thus, it is itself a determinate nothing,
4097580	4099420	and it has a content.
4099420	4102460	So when consciousness undermines
4102460	4105220	some shape of consciousness, some conception of knowledge,
4105220	4107900	the result is not just pure,
4107900	4109860	just the abandonment of knowing.
4109860	4111660	Not just pure nothing.
4111660	4114700	It's a specific or determinate negative nothing.
4114700	4117980	It's the rejection of that previous shape,
4117980	4120580	which is itself its own shape.
4120580	4124820	So what Hegel needs to do is give us a principled reason
4124820	4128860	or a function for why one shape of consciousness
4128860	4131860	undermines itself and gives rise to the next.
4131860	4134420	So there has to be, so to speak, a law of the series.
4134420	4136260	So we have an account of where we start,
4136260	4137340	we have a kind of preliminary account
4137340	4138500	of where we're gonna end,
4138500	4142260	but we also have an account of why we move
4142260	4144020	to the next one that we do move to.
4145580	4147580	By contrast, while the result is graphed,
4147580	4150820	as it is in its truth, as determinate negation,
4150820	4153460	a new form has thereby immediately arisen.
4153460	4156340	And in the negation, the transition is made
4156340	4159140	whereby the progression through the complete series
4159140	4162300	of shapes comes about on its own accord.
4162300	4164540	So to say that a shape of consciousness
4164540	4168140	is a determinate negation is to say that it isn't something,
4168140	4170460	but it's not nothing in general.
4170460	4171740	It's not just nothing.
4171740	4173620	There's a specific thing it isn't,
4173620	4175900	namely the previous shape of consciousness.
4175900	4178420	In particular, it's a shape of consciousness
4178420	4182340	that arises in a principled way out of the failure
4182340	4184180	of the previous shape of consciousness.
4184180	4186460	And Hegel is now going to give us an account
4186460	4189700	of exactly what that function is
4189700	4192060	that gets you from one shape of consciousness
4192060	4193620	that fails to the next.
4194860	4196660	But again, rather than doing that,
4196660	4200220	he then skips to the next topic, which is where it ends.
4200220	4204540	So what we need is an account of where we start,
4204540	4206140	how we move, and where we end.
4206140	4207700	We've seen a little about where we start,
4207700	4209620	a little about how we move,
4209620	4212060	and now Hegel's gonna tell us more about how we end.
4212060	4217060	However, to knowing the goal is necessarily fixed
4217260	4219500	as the series of the progression
4219500	4222020	is as necessarily fixed as the series of the progression,
4222020	4223620	although you haven't really told us exactly
4223620	4225380	what the series of the progression is, Hegel.
4225380	4226420	The goal is the point.
4226420	4228780	The goal is the point at which knowing
4228780	4232340	no longer needs to go beyond its own self.
4232340	4235540	Where knowing itself finds itself,
4235540	4238500	and where the concept corresponds to the object,
4238500	4240780	and the object to the concept.
4240780	4243100	The progression towards this goal
4243100	4245460	is thus also unrelenting,
4245460	4250460	and at no earlier stage dissatisfaction to be felt.
4251820	4254420	So this process will end
4254420	4257700	when there's so little distinction
4257700	4259820	between subject and object,
4259820	4262820	between knowing and the object of knowing,
4262820	4266580	that no skepticism about that shape of consciousness
4266580	4267420	is possible.
4268420	4272140	So it's going to end only with such a complete coincidence
4272140	4274180	of knowing at its object
4274180	4276540	that the skeptical problem
4276540	4281540	about these conceptions of knowledge cannot arise.
4282540	4284460	Now what exactly that is,
4284460	4287460	is only described at the end of the book.
4287460	4289700	It's very, very hard to understand.
4289700	4291900	But that's where we're supposed to go.
4291900	4295700	Okay, now why can consciousness not stop
4295700	4297860	anywhere short of the entity?
4297860	4300180	Consciousness therefore suffers this violence
4300180	4301780	at its own hands,
4301780	4305820	and brings to ruin its own restricted satisfaction.
4305820	4309460	So the failure of these forms of consciousness,
4309460	4310500	these shapes of consciousness,
4310660	4311980	these conceptions of knowledge,
4311980	4313540	is not something external.
4314380	4317180	Consciousness itself realizes
4317180	4319420	that its conception of knowledge is wrong.
4319420	4320860	It does it to itself.
4321980	4323860	With the feeling of this violence,
4323860	4327020	anxiety over the truth might well withdraw
4327020	4330540	and strive to hold onto what it is in danger of losing.
4330540	4333260	But this anxiety can find no rest.
4333260	4336260	Even if it wants to remain in thoughtless indolence,
4336260	4338780	thought spoils the thoughtlessness,
4338820	4341740	and its unrest disturbs the indolence.
4341740	4344860	So as Hegel says on the next page,
4347700	4349140	where can I never find this?
4358380	4360300	I know I have this underlined.
4360300	4362420	Okay, as he says in the next couple of pages,
4362420	4363620	which we will come to,
4363620	4368620	it is an issue for consciousness
4370220	4371980	whether or not its knowing of the object
4371980	4373860	corresponds to the object, that's 56.
4373860	4376540	So consciousness, it cannot be indifferent
4376540	4379220	to consciousness whether it knows.
4379220	4383940	So consciousness purports to no objects.
4383940	4387220	It has a conception of what knowledge is.
4387220	4392220	And Hegel says it is not indifferent to consciousness.
4392380	4395060	Consciousness can't just not care
4395060	4398340	about whether what it thinks knowing is, is knowing.
4399300	4403940	Now, you might think, well,
4403940	4407180	knowledge is just one thing in life.
4407180	4409100	Like I have a lot of family members
4409100	4411860	who don't care that much about what knowledge is.
4411860	4415500	They do, only philosophers are so,
4415500	4419900	only a philosopher could say consciousness
4419900	4421260	with feeling of this violence,
4421260	4423340	anxiety over the truth might well withdraw
4423340	4425260	and strive to hold on to what is in danger of losing.
4425260	4427220	This anxiety can find no rest.
4427220	4428980	Even if it wants to remain in thoughtless indolence,
4428980	4430420	thought spoils the thoughtlessness
4430420	4432820	that its unrest disturbs the indolence.
4432820	4436780	A lot of people, their anxiety does find a rest.
4436780	4439780	They don't, they wanna remain in thoughtless indolence
4439780	4442860	and thought doesn't spoil their thoughtlessness
4442860	4445060	and unrest does not disturb their indolence.
4445060	4447940	They're very happy to not think or not know.
4447940	4452300	So this is not supposed to be a psychological claim
4452300	4455020	about particular conscious subjects.
4455020	4457620	So whatever Hegel's claim is here,
4457620	4460740	is not supposed to be contrary to
4460740	4462980	and therefore not refutable to psychological claims
4462980	4464500	about particular human beings.
4466140	4468180	As we'll see over the course of the phenomenology
4468180	4469940	or if we were to read the whole phenomenology
4469940	4471860	as we would see, knowledge,
4471860	4475140	Hegel thinks of as a very, very general phenomenon.
4475140	4477860	It's sort of ubiquitous or structural
4478660	4479500	in human life.
4479500	4484100	So doing something, action is also a kind of knowledge.
4484100	4487740	It's a representation of the object
4487740	4490460	as being in conformity with your representation of it,
4490460	4491700	as being choice worthy.
4492660	4495820	So there's no way of being indifferent to knowledge.
4495820	4500820	Any acting, any willing, any belief about the world
4503380	4506820	is making a claim to knowledge.
4506820	4510500	So notice I haven't said that knowledge here
4510500	4512380	is this thing that analytic philosophers
4512380	4514620	are kind of pointlessly obsessed with.
4514620	4515660	S knows that P.
4521660	4525460	This is a much more general structure.
4525460	4528340	This is the structure of your relationship with the world.
4529700	4531060	This you might not care about.
4531060	4532460	You probably shouldn't care about it.
4532460	4534340	Stop caring about it.
4534340	4538700	This you walk around life
4538700	4541220	carrying with you a conception of this.
4541220	4543340	It cannot be indifferent to you
4543340	4545660	whether the world does actually relate to you
4545660	4548340	the way you conceive it as related to you.
4548340	4551940	Okay, a little bit further and then we'll take a break.
4551940	4555180	Just as these preliminary and general remarks
4555180	4557700	about the manner and the necessity of the progression
4557700	4562060	have been made, so too it might be useful to recall something
4562060	4564740	about the method of the way it is carried out.
4564740	4567380	So Hegel is now gonna tell us more about
4567380	4570140	how consciousness undermines
4570140	4575140	its own conception of knowledge or the law of the series.
4576620	4577900	Sorry, not the law of the series.
4577900	4579740	The law of the series is how we go from
4579740	4581660	shape of consciousness and the shape of consciousness
4581660	4584740	and plus one, but why we have to move on.
4584740	4586980	Why one shape of consciousness fails.
4588380	4590380	Just as these preliminary and general remarks
4590380	4591500	about the manner and the necessity
4591500	4592740	of the progression have been made,
4592740	4594220	so too it might be useful to recall something
4594220	4595900	about the method of the way it is carried out.
4595900	4599340	This exposition represented as the conduct of science
4599340	4601700	in relation to knowing as it appears
4601700	4604220	and represented as the investigation and testing
4604220	4607140	of the reality of cognition seems incapable
4607140	4610140	of taking place without some kind of presupposition
4610140	4612780	with underlies it as a stem.
4612780	4616420	So it looks like, once again, it appears.
4616420	4619500	That means he's suggesting this is something you might think
4619540	4620980	he's ultimately gonna undermine it.
4620980	4622500	You might think that what we need to do
4622500	4624820	is have a standard of what knowing is
4624820	4626780	and then investigate each shape of consciousness
4626780	4628700	and say, that doesn't meet the standard.
4628700	4630500	That's not what knowing is.
4630500	4633220	For the testing consists in the application
4633220	4637140	of an accepted standard and in the resulting equality
4637140	4642020	or inequality between the standard and what is tested
4642020	4645220	lays the decision as to what is tested
4645220	4647540	is correct or incorrect.
4647540	4650500	The standard, likewise, science itself,
4650500	4652660	if science were to be the standard,
4652660	4655220	is thereby accepted as the essence or as the in itself.
4655220	4657860	Ignore, we'll come back to essence and in itself.
4657860	4659340	But here, at the point where science
4659340	4660900	first comes on the scene,
4660900	4663540	where someone makes a claim to scientific knowledge,
4663540	4665620	neither science itself nor anything else
4665620	4668980	has justified itself as the essence or as the in itself.
4668980	4671340	And without something like that taking place,
4671340	4674940	it seems that no examination could take place at all.
4676020	4677360	So there's this problem.
4677480	4680000	It looks like we need to apply a standard.
4680000	4681840	Where does the standard come from?
4681840	4684240	One can have a more determinant grasp of this contradiction
4684240	4686000	and the removal of the contradiction.
4686000	4687280	If, first of all, one is reminded
4687280	4689800	of the abstract determinations of knowing and truth
4689800	4692840	as they come before consciousness.
4692840	4696600	Okay, so what Hegel is doing in 81
4696600	4700280	is he's making a reference
4700280	4704040	to something called the dilemma of the criterion.
4704040	4706200	I'm going to erase Hegel's system.
4708360	4709960	It's actually very Hegelian.
4711800	4714120	When we get into Hegel's logic,
4714120	4715840	there's going to be a lot of erasure.
4715840	4718000	That's going to be like a main metaphor.
4718000	4721560	Hegel's a great philosopher to teach on the blackboard.
4721560	4722400	Okay.
4724640	4726520	The dilemma of the criterion
4728280	4733040	comes from a work of ancient philosophy
4733040	4735040	by Sextus empiricus.
4737680	4739920	Called outlines of purism.
4744760	4746280	Here's the basic idea.
4749080	4752000	Or this is how Hegel is thinking of the idea in Sextus.
4752000	4753840	That's what matters for our purposes.
4754840	4757880	Someone makes a claim to knowledge.
4757880	4760100	We have to have a standard
4760100	4762480	for whether that counts as knowledge or not.
4762480	4763760	Whether that's a valid knowledge group.
4763760	4766440	Whether that person in fact knows what they claim to know.
4766440	4769160	Now either that standard
4769160	4771920	is that person's own conception of knowledge.
4772780	4774080	In which case it's circular.
4775800	4776640	Very easy.
4776640	4778440	Now, totally useless.
4778440	4781280	Everyone's conception of knowledge agrees with itself,
4781280	4784160	so everyone meets their own standard.
4784160	4787040	Or the standard has to be external
4787040	4788140	to their conception of knowledge.
4788140	4789640	But then it's question-making.
4791680	4793520	So, what Hegel is doing
4793960	4796640	is raising this as a problem for his own project.
4798000	4799120	What we don't want to do
4799120	4802560	is apply external standards or criterions.
4802560	4803400	Criteria.
4806320	4809280	We'll also call it the dilemma of the standard.
4809280	4810120	Maschab.
4812840	4817040	So, what he's going to do is develop a way
4817040	4819680	of how consciousness can undermine
4819680	4821440	its own conception of knowledge
4821480	4824120	that doesn't run into the dilemma of the criteria.
4826760	4830360	One can have a more determinate grasp of this contradiction
4830360	4832400	and the removal of the contradiction
4832400	4834640	if first of all, one is reminded
4834640	4837600	of the abstract determinations of knowing their truth
4837600	4839520	as they come before consciousness.
4839520	4842040	Okay, abstract determinations means
4842040	4844000	these are sort of,
4844000	4847080	Hegel's now going to give us a very abstract model
4847080	4849300	of what consciousness acknowledges.
4849300	4851620	Now, if we were reading the whole phenomenology,
4851620	4853780	one question would be whether this model
4853780	4856260	in the introduction actually applies to the whole book.
4856260	4857940	I don't think it does,
4857940	4860300	but I think it's fine for our purposes
4860300	4861660	because it applies to the parts of the book
4861660	4862820	that we're going to read.
4862820	4866940	So, consciousness distinguishes something from itself
4866940	4869660	while at the same time it relates itself to it.
4869660	4874140	Okay, so I'm going to remove the term subject and object
4874140	4877360	because those are not yet Hegel's terms.
4879300	4883540	So we have consciousness.
4886700	4890980	It has a relation to something distinct from itself
4891980	4894580	and it also distinguishes itself from it.
4894580	4896500	Or, as it is expressed,
4896500	4899660	the something is something for consciousness.
4903540	4906940	This is for consciousness.
4907020	4909860	Something consciousness is of.
4911780	4913380	This something is something for consciousness
4913380	4915900	and the determinate aspect of this relating
4915900	4919040	or of the being of something for a consciousness is known.
4921340	4925300	So knowing is a relation of consciousness to the object.
4927000	4929620	In this direction, this object is for consciousness.
4929620	4932820	In this direction, consciousness knows this object.
4932820	4935740	However, we distinguish the being for another
4935740	4937380	from being in itself.
4946860	4948820	That which is related to knowing
4948820	4951180	is just as much distinguished from knowing
4951180	4955340	and is positive as being also external to this relation.
4955340	4960100	The aspect of this in itself is called truth.
4960100	4963280	So the aspect of being in itself
4963280	4968280	that it can be if outstanding in this relationship is truth.
4968480	4969320	Now what does that mean?
4969320	4972640	What it means is this is a super abstract structural
4972640	4975000	description of consciousness and knowledge.
4975000	4978580	Consciousness distinguishes itself from something,
4978580	4980240	the object of consciousness,
4980240	4983240	but also relates itself to knowing.
4983240	4984320	And remember, knowing here
4984320	4986400	is not necessarily propositional knowledge.
4986400	4987400	Don't worry about that.
4987400	4990080	It could be acquaintance, perceiving something.
4990080	4993080	That's a kind of note, willing something.
4993120	4997060	But what it knows has some kind of independence
4997060	4998920	of its relationship to it.
4998920	5002040	That is to say that being,
5002040	5005600	what it knows is not identical to its knowledge.
5005600	5007120	Now that doesn't mean
5007120	5010320	that this thing is completely independent of this.
5011440	5015160	It means that it isn't simply identical to this.
5015160	5018020	It means that if we got rid of this entirely,
5018020	5020600	we would have a completely different model.
5020600	5022960	Okay, that's all Hegel is assuming.
5022960	5025540	Now, Rota's truth here does not mean P.
5030040	5033280	analytic philosophy is very into P's and Q's and R's.
5033280	5036060	It is, as I like to call it, philosophy in the key of P.
5037840	5040520	Hegel is not a philosopher in the key of P.
5040520	5043600	As we'll see over the course of this semester,
5043600	5046640	I think it's actually super crucial to understanding Hegel
5046640	5049440	that Hegel cannot be put in the form of P.
5049440	5051480	There is no P, there's no value of P,
5051480	5053480	especially Hegel's view is P.
5053480	5054880	Yes.
5054880	5057640	Knowing determines consciousness
5057640	5061080	or consciousness determines knowing.
5061080	5063600	Consciousness, for now we're assuming
5063600	5066020	that knowing is the relationship
5066020	5068080	of consciousness to the object.
5068080	5071240	Knowing is a relation that consciousness has to the object.
5071240	5073960	We only call something consciousness right now
5073960	5076200	insofar as it stands in a knowing relation
5076200	5078800	to the object, to the in itself.
5078840	5083640	Okay, skip a paragraph, but the nature of the object
5083640	5087960	which we are investigating goes beyond this division
5087960	5091640	or to this semblance of division and presupposition.
5091640	5094320	So it looks like we have a distinction
5094320	5098600	between consciousness and our conception of consciousness.
5098600	5102240	This thing on the blackboard is a conception of consciousness.
5104560	5107800	But the nature of this object is that distinction
5108880	5113880	between this and the whole thing is overcome.
5116280	5120800	Consciousness in its own self provides its own standard
5120800	5124320	and the investigation will therefore be a comparison
5124320	5128520	of itself, of it with itself, for the difference
5128520	5133000	which has just been made falls within consciousness.
5133000	5136320	That is to say, consciousness itself
5137320	5138880	has a conception of this.
5144820	5148280	So this difference between consciousness
5148280	5151640	and being in itself falls within consciousness
5151640	5154360	because consciousness is consciousness.
5154360	5156380	We can also know if I was a better drawer,
5156380	5159320	I could have put this thought bubble inside consciousness.
5159320	5160520	Hard to draw with chalk.
5162320	5166200	Consciousness is its own self, provides its own standard.
5167020	5168560	So consciousness brings with it a standard
5168560	5169720	of what knowledge is.
5171800	5175160	Therefore, skipping again a few sentences,
5175160	5179120	therefore in what consciousness declares within itself
5179120	5183120	to be the in itself or the true, we have the standard
5183120	5186920	which consciousness itself sets up to measure its known.
5186920	5191060	So consciousness has a standard, it has to know this.
5192120	5193400	That sets a standard.
5194240	5197600	If we designate knowing as the concept,
5197600	5202140	but designate the essence or the true over here
5202140	5205900	as what is or the object, then the examining consists
5205900	5208860	in whether the concept corresponds to the object.
5208860	5212840	Does this correspond to that?
5212840	5216500	Is this a way of knowingly relating to that?
5216500	5219920	Well remember, what relation knowing is also,
5219920	5221680	it's up to consciousness to say.
5221680	5223560	So don't assume that it's true justified belief
5223560	5224600	or whatever.
5224600	5226160	Let me just go a little bit further.
5226160	5228540	Oh, 84.
5230280	5231560	End of 84.
5236120	5239640	What is essential throughout the whole investigation
5239640	5242440	is to hold fast to this, that both of these moments,
5242440	5245720	concept and object, being for another,
5245720	5247800	being for consciousness and being in itself,
5247800	5251320	themselves fall within the knowing that we are investigating.
5251360	5253400	They fall within consciousness.
5253400	5255280	They fall within consciousness's conception
5255280	5256760	of itself as known.
5256760	5259960	And that we thus do not need to bring standards with us
5259960	5263220	and in the investigation to apply our ideas and thoughts.
5264200	5265120	But now you might think, okay,
5265120	5267660	isn't Hegel running into one horn
5267660	5269480	of the dilemma of the criterion?
5269480	5271780	Every conception of knowing is just going to agree
5271780	5273580	with its own standard.
5273580	5275680	No, Hegel's about target.
5275680	5277920	That actually shapes of consciousness in general
5277920	5280120	do not agree with their own standard.
5280120	5282200	However, from this aspect,
5282200	5285620	not only will it be superfluous for us to add anything,
5285620	5287460	and not only because concept and object,
5287460	5288920	the standard and what is to be examined
5288920	5291580	are present in consciousness itself,
5291580	5296580	the only thing that remains is for us to purely look on.
5296580	5299360	So now this is a super important aspect
5299360	5301000	of the way Hegel does philosophy.
5301000	5302440	And this is the first instance of it
5302440	5304360	that we've seen in the phenomenology.
5304360	5307780	Hegel's philosophy is supposed to always be imminent.
5308780	5313780	That means there's some subject matter
5315520	5318620	and the further development of the claims
5318620	5321300	about that subject matter in Hegel's philosophy
5321300	5323540	arise from the subject matter itself.
5324740	5328160	That means at no point in the phenomenology
5328160	5332000	can Hegel say, look, it's plausible that this,
5332000	5335320	or I think that, or in my view this,
5335320	5338520	everything has to come out of consciousness itself.
5338520	5340080	And since the beginning of the phenomenology
5340080	5341280	is natural consciousness,
5341280	5343720	it has to arise from natural consciousness itself.
5343720	5345400	So what we do in the phenomenology
5345400	5348440	is we just observe natural consciousness
5348440	5352180	developing itself through these shapes of consciousness
5352180	5353480	to absolute knowing.
5355560	5359880	It is consciousness of what to it is the true.
5359880	5361960	So it's consciousness of this
5361960	5366220	as well as consciousness of its knowing of the truth.
5366220	5368540	So it's conscious not only of this,
5368540	5370360	but of this whole thing.
5370360	5372140	So it's object consciousness,
5372140	5375720	but also consciousness of itself as knowing
5375720	5378320	under a particular description of what knowing is.
5379920	5381880	It is an issue for that consciousness
5381880	5383760	whether or not it's knowing of the object
5383760	5385760	corresponds to the object.
5385760	5388160	So consciousness cannot be indifferent
5388160	5390420	to whether this agrees with that.
5391420	5393940	Because it itself has supplied the criteria.
5395540	5400100	Okay, so we're gonna somehow argue
5400100	5402820	that various shapes of consciousness
5402820	5405020	fail their own criteria.
5405020	5408460	That they think this is a knowing of that,
5408460	5410700	but this as they themselves conceive it
5410700	5412820	is not a knowing of that.
5412820	5415740	Okay, we'll take one a little bit
5415740	5416840	and then we'll take a break
5416840	5418940	and then we'll read the last three paragraphs
5418940	5419780	really carefully.
5421140	5423380	This dialectical movement.
5423380	5425900	Ah, okay, so you've been wondering,
5425900	5426860	you're taking a Hegel class
5426860	5428100	and he's been doing it for two hours.
5428100	5429500	He hasn't said the word dialectic yet.
5429500	5430340	Okay.
5432700	5433540	Dialectic.
5437860	5438700	Hegel.
5441660	5445940	In some sense, all of Hegel's philosophy
5445940	5448460	works by something called the dialectic
5448460	5450100	or dialectical progression.
5451380	5453540	I think the structure of the dialectic
5453540	5455860	in phenomenology is different
5455860	5458980	than the structure of the dialectic in the larger.
5458980	5460760	I don't understand the dialectic
5460760	5461740	of the philosophy of nature
5461740	5463220	or really the philosophy of spirit either,
5463220	5464140	but I really don't understand
5464140	5465420	the dialectic philosophy of nature.
5465420	5467620	No one really understands the dialectic philosophy of nature.
5467620	5470340	But what does Hegel mean by the word dialectic?
5471860	5474260	There's two historical sources that are relevant.
5474260	5476980	One, in ancient philosophy,
5477020	5479740	dialectic, very simply put,
5479740	5483480	is the science of refuting what other people say.
5483480	5486740	So it's a negative logical art
5486740	5487900	where you say something
5487900	5489460	and I reduce you to absurdity.
5490900	5495500	In Kant, there's something called the transcendental dialect.
5497180	5500260	Now the transcendental dialectic actually has three parts,
5500260	5504380	but Hegel always associates the dialectic with the antinomies.
5504380	5507860	The idea of the antinomies of pure reason
5507860	5511740	in the first critique is that reason itself
5511740	5513580	is subject to a dialectic.
5513580	5517020	So it's not that someone comes along and refutes reason,
5517020	5519180	reason refutes itself.
5519180	5523560	It refutes itself and so far as it assumes
5523560	5526460	that objects in space and time are things in themselves
5527420	5529860	because it forms this conception
5529860	5532300	of something called the unconditioned.
5532340	5534860	So you take something, you take its conditions
5534860	5537900	and then you take the complete sequence of its conditions.
5537900	5542660	And it has a proof that that sequence of conditions
5542660	5545300	terminates in an unconditioned first condition
5545300	5547640	and it has a proof that it cannot terminate,
5547640	5549020	that it goes on infinitely.
5549020	5550340	That's a contradiction.
5550340	5553020	And so the resolution to that contradiction, Kant thinks,
5553020	5554780	is to recognize that objects in space and time
5554780	5557220	are appearances and so there is no such thing
5557220	5559740	as the unconditioned totality of their conditions.
5559740	5560940	If you haven't taken 3.14,
5560940	5562980	that wouldn't really make a lot of sense to you,
5562980	5564580	but you should all just take 3.14.
5564580	5566840	Okay, who's taking 3.14?
5568100	5569780	Good, the rest of you should model yourselves
5569780	5571300	on those who are taking 3.14.
5573300	5576540	So what Hegel means by a dialectic
5576540	5579000	is as in ancient philosophy,
5580160	5584880	refutation is a negative, it's negative.
5585940	5590260	But as with Kant, it's not refutation by some other person.
5591940	5595220	It's not external refutation, it's self-refutation.
5595220	5598140	It's the self-refutation here in the phenomenology
5598140	5599940	of shapes of consciousness,
5599940	5602380	of conceptions of what knowledge is.
5602380	5607340	The difference between both ancient dialectic,
5607340	5609580	Kantian dialectic and Hegelian dialectic
5609580	5613020	is as we saw earlier, Hegel thinks that dialectic
5613020	5615180	is not purely negative.
5615180	5617500	It's productive or positive.
5617620	5619820	So when we dialectically undermine
5619820	5621260	the shape of consciousness,
5621260	5624460	we don't go, oh fuck, we have a contradiction.
5624460	5627180	That generates positive content.
5628580	5630940	What Hegel calls the determinant negation
5630940	5632500	of the refuted shape of consciousness,
5632500	5635660	which is the successor shape of consciousness,
5635660	5639540	which in a principled fashion, non-orbitarily,
5639540	5642360	attempts to resolve the contradiction
5642360	5644620	in the earlier shape of consciousness.
5644620	5645660	So no, that's why.
5645660	5648620	So that means the phenomenology of spirit
5648620	5651520	is the inner dialectic of knowing.
5651520	5654660	But it's not just refutation, it's also position.
5654660	5656120	It's also positive.
5656120	5658660	The self-refutation of one shape of consciousness
5658660	5661180	generates the next shape of consciousness.
5661180	5663500	And that's why it's important
5663500	5666260	that Hegel give us a principled function
5666260	5668140	from shape of consciousness n
5668140	5670340	to shape of consciousness n plus one.
5670340	5673020	Because otherwise, the imminence
5673020	5676460	of the phenomenology of spirit would be wrecked.
5676460	5679460	That is to say, we would have to supply it.
5679460	5680980	We'd be like, what's a reasonable
5680980	5682220	next shape of consciousness?
5682220	5684180	Well, this seems good.
5684180	5687940	And it would no longer be consciousness developing itself.
5687940	5690860	And so in a certain way, it would fall a foul
5690860	5692980	of the problem of the criterion.
5692980	5696060	Something external to consciousness
5696060	5699060	would be telling it what its next standard should be.
5699060	5701420	And consciousness would not be rationally obliged
5701420	5702260	to accept that.
5703220	5708220	So we require an in-principle account
5708500	5711220	of how one shape of consciousness
5711220	5714260	gives rise to the next shape of consciousness.
5714260	5719260	Okay, why don't we take a 10-minute break
5720620	5722940	and come back at 54 past?
5722940	5724900	If you are auditing this class
5724900	5727620	and you have not yet been added to Quirkus,
5727620	5728860	please come speak to me
5728860	5731100	and I will add you to Quirkus right now.
5737780	5738620	Hello.
5738620	5739460	Can I add it?
5739460	5740620	Yes, you just.
5744060	5745980	It makes me so warm.
5745980	5746820	Dial in.
