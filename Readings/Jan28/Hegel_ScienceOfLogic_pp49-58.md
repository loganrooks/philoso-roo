The Doctrine of Being 49
It must be admitted that it is an essential consideration – one which
will be found elaborated again within the logic itself – that progression is a
retreat to the ground, to the origin and the truth on which that with which
the beginning was made, and from which it is in fact produced, depends. –
Thus consciousness, on its forward path from the immediacy with which
it began, is led back to the absolute knowledge which is its innermost
truth. This truth, the ground, is then also that from which the original
first proceeds, the same first which at the beginning came on the scene as
something immediate. – It is most of all in this way that absolute spirit
(which is revealed as the concrete and supreme truth of all being) comes
to be known, as at the end of the development it freely externalizes itself,
letting itself go into the shape of an immediate being – resolving itself into
the creation of a world which contains all that fell within the development
preceding that result and which, through this reversal of position with
its beginning, is converted into something dependent on the result as
principle. Essential to science is not so much that a pure immediacy should
be the beginning, but that the whole of science is in itself a circle in which
the first becomes also the last, and the last also the first.
Conversely, it follows that it is just as necessary to consider as result that
into which the movement returns as to its ground. In this respect, the first 21.58
is just as much the ground, and the last a derivative; since the movement
makes its start fromthe first and by correct inferences arrives at the last as the
ground, this last is result. Further, the advance from that which constitutes
the beginning is to be considered only as one more determination of the
same advance, so that this beginning remains as the underlying ground of
all that follows without vanishing from it. The advance does not consist in
the derivation of an other, or in the transition to a truly other: inasmuch
as there is a transition, it is equally sublated again. Thus the beginning
of philosophy is the ever present and self-preserving foundation of all
subsequent developments, remaining everywhere immanent in its further
determinations.
In this advance the beginning thus loses the one-sidedness that it has
when determined simply as something immediate and abstract; it becomes
mediated, and the line of scientific forward movement consequently turns
into a circle. – It also follows that what constitutes the beginning, because it
is something still undeveloped and empty of content, is not yet truly known
at that beginning, and that only science, and science fully developed, is the
completed cognition of it, replete with content and finally truly grounded.
But for this reason, because it is as absolute ground that the result finally
emerges, the progression of this cognition is not anything provisory, still
50 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
problematic and hypothetical, but must be determined through the nature
of the matter at issue and of the content itself. Nor is the said beginning an
arbitrary and only temporary assumption,5 or something which seems to
be an arbitrary and tentative presupposition but of which it is subsequently
shown that to make it the starting point was indeed the right thing to do;
this is not as when we are instructed to make certain constructions in order
to aid the proof of a geometrical theorem, and only in retrospect, in the
course of the proof, does it become apparent that we did well to draw
precisely these lines and then, in the proof itself, to begin by comparing
21.59 them or the enclosed angles – though the line-drawing or the comparing
themselves escape conceptual comprehension.
So we have just given, right within science itself, the reason why in pure
science the beginning is made with pure being. This pure being is the unity
into which pure knowledge returns, or if this knowledge, as form, is itself
still to be kept distinct from its unity, then pure being is also its content.
It is in this respect that this pure being, this absolute immediate, is just as
absolutely mediated. However, just because it is here as the beginning, it is
just as essential that it should be taken in the one-sidedness of being purely
immediate. If it were not this pure indeterminacy, if it were determined, it
would be taken as something mediated, would already be carried further
than itself: a determinate something has the character of an other with
respect to a first. It thus lies in the nature of a beginning itself that it should
be being and nothing else. There is no need, therefore, of other preparations
to enter philosophy, no need of further reflections or access points.
Nor can we derive a more specific determination or a more positive content
for the beginning of philosophy from the fact that it is such a beginning.6
For here, at the beginning, where the fact itself is not yet at hand, philosophy
is an empty word, a received and yet unjustified notion. Pure knowledge
yields only this negative determination, namely that the beginning ought
to be abstract. If pure being is taken as the content of pure knowledge,
then the latter must step back from its content, allowing it free play and
without determining it further. – Or again, inasmuch as pure being is
to be considered as the unity into which knowledge has collapsed when
at the highest point of union with its objectification, knowledge has then
disappeared into this unity, leaving behind no distinction from it and hence
no determination for it. – Nor is there anything else present, any content
whatever, that could be used to make a more determinate beginning with
it.
5 i.e. as Reinhold thought. 6 The allusion is still to Reinhold.
The Doctrine of Being 51
But, it may be said, the determination of being assumed so far as the
beginning can also be let go, so that the only requirement would be that a 21.60
pure beginning should be made.Nothing would then be at hand except the
beginning itself, and we must see what this would be. – This position could
be suggested also for the benefit of those who are either not comfortable,
for whatever reason, with beginning with being and even less with the
transition into nothing that follows from being, or who simply do not
know how else to make a beginning in a science except by presupposing
a representation which is subsequently analyzed, the result of the analysis
then yielding the first determinate concept in the science. If we also want
to test this strategy, we must relinquish every particular object that we may
intend, since the beginning, as the beginning of thought, is meant to be
entirely abstract, entirely general, all form with no content; we must have
nothing, therefore, except the representation of a mere beginning as such.
We have, therefore, only to see what there is in this representation.
As yet there is nothing, and something is supposed to become. The
beginning is not pure nothing but a nothing, rather, from which something
is to proceed; also being, therefore, is already contained in the beginning.
Therefore, the beginning contains both, being and nothing; it is the unity
of being and nothing, or is non-being which is at the same time being, and
being which is at the same time non-being.
Further, being and nothing are present in the beginning as distinguished;
for the beginning points to something other – it is a non-being which refers
to an other; that which begins, as yet is not; it only reaches out to being.
The being contained in the beginning is such, therefore, that it distances
itself from non-being or sublates it as something which is opposed to it.
But further, that which begins already is, but is also just as much not yet.
The opposites, being and non-being, are therefore in immediate union in
it; or the beginning is their undifferentiated unity.
An analysis of the beginning would thus yield the concept of the unity of
being and non-being – or, in a more reflected form, the concept of the unity
of differentiated and undifferentiated being – or of the identity of identity
and non-identity.7 This concept could be regarded as the first, purest, that
is, most abstract, definition of the absolute – as it would indeed be if the
issue were just the form of definitions and the name of the absolute. In this
sense, just as such an abstract concept would be the first definition of the 21.61
absolute, so all further determinations and developments would be only
7 This is Hegel’s earliest formulation of his position. Cf. The Difference Between Fichte’s and Schelling’s
System of Philosophy (1801), p. 156. GW4, 6.23.7–21.
52 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
more determinate and richer definitions of it. But let those who are not
satisfied with being as the beginning, since being passes over into nothing
and what emerges is the unity of the two – let them consider what is more
likely to satisfy them: this beginning that begins with the representation
of the beginning and an analysis of it (an analysis that is indeed correct yet
equally leads to the unity of being and non-being) or a beginning which
makes being the beginning.
But, regarding this strategy, there is still a further observation to be made.
The said analysis presupposes that the representation of the beginning is
known; its strategy follows the example of other sciences. These presuppose
their object and presume that everyone has the same representation of it and
will find in it roughly the same determinations which they have collected
here or there, through analysis, comparison, and sundry argumentation,
and they then offer as its representations. But that which constitutes the
absolute beginning must likewise be something otherwise known; now,
if it is something concrete and hence in itself variously determined, then
this connectedness which it is in itself is presupposed as a known; the connectedness
is thereby adduced as something immediate, which however it is
not; for it is connectedness only as a connection of distinct elements and
therefore contains mediation within itself. Further, the accidentality and
the arbitrariness of the analysis and the specific mode of determination
affect the concrete internally. Which determinations are elicited depends
on what each individual happens to discover in his immediate accidental
representation. The connection contained within a concrete something,
within a synthetic unity, is necessary only in so far as it is not found already
given but is produced rather by the spontaneous return of the moments
21.62 back into this unity, a movement which is the opposite of the analytical
procedure that occurs rather within the subject and is external to the fact
itself.
Here we then have the precise reason why that with which the beginning
is to be made cannot be anything concrete, anything containing a
connection within its self. It is because, as such, it would presuppose within
itself a process of mediation and the transition from a first to an other, of
which process the concrete something, now become a simple, would be
the result. But the beginning ought not itself to be already a first and an
other, for anything which is in itself a first and an other implies that an
advance has already been made. Consequently, that which constitutes the
beginning, the beginning itself, is to be taken as something unanalyzable,
taken in its simple, unfilled immediacy; and therefore as being, as complete
emptiness.
The Doctrine of Being 53
If, impatient with this talk of an abstract beginning, one should say that
the beginning is to be made, not with the beginning, but directly with the
fact itself, well then, this subject matter is nothing else than that empty
being. For what this subject matter is, that is precisely what ought to result
only in the course of the science, what the latter cannot presuppose to
know in advance.
On any other form otherwise assumed in an effort to have a beginning
other than empty being, that beginning would still suffer from the same
defects. Let those who are still dissatisfied with this beginning take upon
themselves the challenge of beginning in some other way and yet avoiding
such defects.
But we cannot leave entirely unmentioned a more original beginning
to philosophy which has recently gained notoriety, the beginning with the
“I.”8 It derived from both the reflection that all that follows from the first
truth must be deduced from it, and the need that this first truth should be
something with which one is already acquainted, and even more than just
acquainted, something of which one is immediately certain. This proposed
beginning is not, as such, an accidental representation, or one which might
be one thing to one subject and something else to another. For the “I,” this
immediate consciousness of the self, appears from the start to be both itself
an immediate something and something with which we are acquainted in a
much deeper sense than with any other representation; true, anything else
known belongs to this “I,” but it belongs to it as a content which remains
distinct from it and is therefore accidental; the “I,” by contrast, is the simple 21.63
certainty of its self. But the “I” is, as such, at the same time also a concrete,
or rather, the “I” is the most concrete of all things – the consciousness of
itself as an infinitely manifold world. Before the “I” can be the beginning
and foundation of philosophy, this concreteness must be excised, and this
is the absolute act by virtue of which the “I” purifies itself and makes its
entrance into consciousness as abstract “I.” But this pure “I” is now not
immediate, is not the familiar, ordinary “I” of our consciousness to which
everyone immediately links science. Truly, that act of excision would be
none other than the elevation to the standpoint of pure knowledge in
which the distinction between subject and object has disappeared. But
as thus immediately demanded, this elevation is a subjective postulate;
before it proves itself as a valid demand, the progression of the concrete “I”
from immediate consciousness to pure knowledge must be demonstratively
exhibited within the “I” itself, through its own necessity. Without this
8 The reference here is to Fichte. Cf. Wissenschaftslehre (1794), §1.
54 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
objective movement, pure knowledge, also when defined as intellectual
intuition, appears as an arbitrary standpoint, itself one of those empirical
states of consciousness for which everything depends on whether someone,
though not necessarily somebody else, discovers it within himself or is able
to produce it there. But inasmuch as this pure “I” must be essential, pure
knowledge – and pure knowledge is however one which is only posited in
individual consciousness through an absolute act of self-elevation, is not
present in it immediately – we lose the very advantage which was to derive
from this beginning of philosophy, namely that it is something with which
everyone iswell acquainted, something which everyone finds within himself
and to which he can attach further reflection; that pure “I,” on the contrary,
in its abstract, essential nature, is to ordinary consciousness an unknown,
something that the latter does not find within itself. What comes with it is
rather the disadvantage of the illusion that we are speaking of something
supposedly very familiar, the “I” of empirical self-consciousness, whereas
at issue is in fact something far removed from the latter. Determining
pure knowledge as “I” acts as a continuing reminder of the subjective “I”
21.64 whose limitations should rather be forgotten; it leads to the belief that
the propositions and relations which result from the further development
of the “I” occur within ordinary consciousness and can be found pregiven
there, indeed that the whole issue is about this consciousness. This
mistake, far from bringing clarity, produces instead an even more glaring
and bewildering confusion; among the public at large, it has occasioned
the crudest of misunderstandings.
Further, as regards the subjective determinateness of the “I” in general,
pure knowledge does remove from it the restriction that it has when understood
as standing in unsurmountable opposition to an object. But for this
reason it would be at least superfluous still to hold on to this subjective
attitude by determining pure knowledge as “I.” For this determination not
only carries with it that troublesome duality of subject and object; on closer
examination, it also remains a subjective “I.” The actual development of
the science that proceeds from the “I” shows that in the course of it the
object has and retains the self-perpetuating determination of an other with
respect to the “I”; that therefore the “I” from which the start was made
does not have the pure knowledge that has truly overcome the opposition
of consciousness, but is rather still entangled in appearance.
In this connection, there is the further essential observation to be made
that, although the “I” might well be determined to be in itself pure knowledge
or intellectual intuition and declared to be the beginning, in science
we are not concerned with what is present in itself or as something inner, but
The Doctrine of Being 55
with the external existence9 rather of what in thought is inner and with the
determinateness which this inner assumes in that existence. But whatever
externalization there might be of10 intellectual intuition at the beginning of
science, or – if the subject matter of science is called the eternal, the divine,
the absolute – of the eternal or absolute, this cannot be anything else than a
first, immediate, simple determination. Whatever richer name be given to
it than is expressed by mere being, the only legitimate consideration is how
such an absolute enters into discursive11 knowledge and the enunciation of
this knowledge. Intellectual intuition might well be the violent rejection 21.65
of mediation and of demonstrative, external reflection. However, anything
which it says over and above simple immediacy would be something concrete,
and this concrete would contain a diversity of determinations in it.
But, as already remarked, the enunciation and exposition of this concrete
something is a process of mediation which starts with one of the determinations
and proceeds to another, even though this other returns to the first –
and this is a movement which, moreover, is not allowed to be arbitrary
or assertoric. Consequently, that from which the beginning is made in any
such exposition is not something itself concrete but only the simple immediacy
from which the movement proceeds. Besides, what is lacking if we
make something concrete the beginning is the demonstration which the
combination of the determinations contained in it requires.
Therefore, if in the expression of the absolute, or the eternal, orGod (and
God would have the perfectly undisputed right that the beginning be made
with him), if in the intuition or the thought of them, there is more than
there is in pure being, then this more should first emerge in a knowledge
which is discursive12 and not figurative;13 as rich as what is implicitly
contained in knowledge may be, the determination that first emerges in
it is something simple, for it is only in the immediate that no advance is
yet made from one thing to an other. Consequently, whatever in the richer
representations of the absolute or God might be said or implied over and
above being, all this is at the beginning only an empty word and only
being; this simple determination which has no further meaning besides,
this empty something, is as such, therefore, the beginning of philosophy.
This insight is itself so simple that this beginning is as beginning in
no need of any preparation or further introduction, and the only possible
purpose of this preliminary disquisition regarding it was not to lead up to
it but to dispense rather with all preliminaries. 21.66

56 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
general division of being
Being is determined, first, as against another in general; secondly, it is
internally self-determining; thirdly, as this preliminary division is cast off,
it is the abstract indeterminateness and immediacy in which it must be the
beginning.
According to the first determination, being partitions itself off from
essence, for further on in its development it proves to be in its totality only
one sphere of the concept, and to this sphere as moment it opposes another
sphere.
According to the second, it is the sphere within which fall the determinations
and the entire movement of its reflection. In this, being will posit
itself in three determinations:
I. as determinateness; as such, quality;
II. as sublated determinateness; magnitude, quantity;
III. as qualitatively determined quantity; measure.
This division, as was generally remarked of such divisions in the
Introduction,14 is here a preliminary statement; its determinations must
first arise from the movement of being itself, and receive their definitions
and justification by virtue of it. As regards the divergence of this division
from the usual listing of the categories, namely quantity, quality, relation
and modality – for Kant, incidentally, these are supposed to be only classifications
of his categories, but are in fact themselves categories, only more
abstract ones15 – about this, there is nothing to remark here, since the entire
listing will diverge from the usual ordering and meaning of the categories
at every point.
This only can perhaps be remarked, that the determination of quantity
is ordinarily listed ahead of quality and as a rule this is done for no given
reason. It has already been shown that the beginning is made with being
21.67 as such, and hence with qualitative being. It is clear from a comparison
of quality with quantity that the former is by nature first. For quantity is
quality which has already become negative; magnitude is the determinateness
which, no longer one with being but already distinguished from it, is
the sublated quality that has become indifferent. It includes the alterability
of being without altering the fact itself, namely being, of which it is
the determination; qualitative determinateness is on the contrary one with
its being, it neither transcends it nor stays within it but is its immediate
14 Cf. above, 21.38 and 39. 15 Cf A80/B106, B110.
The Doctrine of Being 57
restrictedness. Hence quality, as the determinateness which is immediate,
is the first and it is with it that the beginning is to be made.
Measure is a relation, not relation in general but specifically of quality
and quantity to each other; the categories dealt with by Kant under relation
will come up elsewhere in their proper place.16 Measure, if one so wishes,
can be considered also a modality; but since with Kant modality is no
longer supposed to make up a determination of content, but only concerns
the reference of the content to thought, to the subjective, the result is a
totally heterogeneous reference that does not belong here.17
The third determination of being falls within the section Quality inasmuch
as being, as abstract immediacy, reduces itself to one single determinateness
as against its other determinacies inside its sphere. 21.68
16 Cf. below, 11.394–409.
17 There is an almost imperceptible, yet very important difference here between the 1812 and the 1832
edition. In the earlier text, Kant is not mentioned at all, but Hegel seems to accept what is in fact
his position regarding modality. In the present text, Kant’s position is explicitly mentioned, but
Hegel distances himself from it. For the importance of this change, see the editor’s “Introduction.”
Cf. A219/B266.
section i
Determinateness (Quality)
Being is the indeterminate immediate; it is free of determinateness with
respect to essence, just as it is still free of any determinateness that it can
receive within itself. This reflectionless being is being as it immediately is
only within.
Since it is immediate, it is being without quality; but the character
of indeterminateness attaches to it in itself only in opposition to what is
determinate or qualitative. Determinate being thus comes to stand over and
against being in general; with that, however, the very indeterminateness
of being constitutes its quality. It will therefore be shown that the first
being is in itself determinate, and therefore, secondly, that it passes over
into existence, is existence; that this latter, however, as finite being, sublates
itself and passes over into the infinite reference of being to itself; it passes
over, thirdly, into being-for-itself.
