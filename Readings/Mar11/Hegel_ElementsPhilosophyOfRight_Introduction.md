§ 1
The subject-matter of the philosophical science of right is the Idea of right – the concept of right and its actualization.1

Philosophy has to do with Ideas and therefore not with what are commonly described as mere concepts. On the contrary, it shows that the latter are one-sided and lacking in truth, and that it is the concept alone (not what is so often called by that name, but which is merely an abstract determination of the understanding) which has actuality, and in such a way that it gives actuality to itself. Everything other than this actuality which is posited by the concept itself is transitory existence [Dasein], external contingency, opinion, appearance without essence, untruth, deception, etc. The shape which the concept assumes in its actualization, and which is essential for cognition of the concept itself, is different from its form of being purely as concept, and is the other essential moment of the Idea.

Addition (H). The concept and its existence [Existenz] are two aspects [of the same thing], separate and united, like soul and body. The body is the same life as the soul, and yet the two can be said to lie outside one another. A soul without a body would not be a living thing, and vice versa. Thus the existence [Dasein] of the concept is its body, just as the latter obeys the soul which produced it. The buds have the tree within them and contain its entire strength, although they are not yet the tree itself. The tree corresponds entirely to the simple image of the bud. If the body does not correspond to the soul, it is a wretched thing indeed. The unity of existence [Dasein] and the concept, of body and soul, is the Idea. It is not just a harmony, but a complete interpenetration. Nothing lives which is not in some way Idea. The Idea of right is freedom, and in order to be truly apprehended, it must be recognizable in its concept and in the concept’s existence [Dasein].

§ 2
The science of right is a part of philosophy. It has therefore to develop the Idea, which is the reason within an object [Gegenstand], out of the concept; or what comes to the same thing, it must observe the proper immanent development of the thing [Sache] itself. As a part [of philosophy], it has a determinate starting point, which is the result and truth of what preceded it, and what preceded it is the so-called proof of that result. Hence the concept of right, so far as its coming into being is concerned, falls outside the science of right; its deduction is presupposed here and is to be taken as given.1

Addition (G). Philosophy forms a circle.2 It has an initial or immediate point – for it must begin somewhere – a point which is not demonstrated and is not a result. But the starting point of philosophy is immediately relative, for it must appear at another end-point as a result. Philosophy is a sequence which is not suspended in mid-air; it does not begin immediately, but is rounded off within itself.

According to the formal, non-philosophical method of the sciences, the first thing which is sought and required, at least for the sake of external scientific form, is the definition. The positive science of right cannot be much concerned with this, however, since its chief aim is to state what is right and legal [Rechtens], i.e. what the particular legal determinations are. This is the reason for the warning: ‘omnis definitio in iure civili periculosa.’a3 And in fact, the more incoherent and internally contradictory the determinations of a [system of] right are, the less possible it will be to make definitions within it; for definitions should contain universal determinations, but in the present context, these would immediately make the contradictory element – in this case, what is unjust [das Unrechtliche] – visible in all its nakedness. Thus, in Roman law [das römische Recht], for example, no definition of a human being would be possible, for the slave could not be subsumed under it; indeed, the status [Stand] of the slave does violence to that concept. The definitions of ‘property’ and ‘proprietor’ would seem equally hazardous in many situations. – But the deduction of the definition may perhaps be reached by means of etymology, or chiefly by abstraction from particular cases, so that it is ultimately based on the feelings and ideas [Vorstellung] of human beings. The correctness of the definition is then made to depend on its agreement with prevailing ideas [Vorstellungen]. This method leaves out of account what is alone essential to science – with regard to content, the necessity of the thing [Sache] in and for itself (in this case, of right), and with regard to form, the nature of the concept. In philosophical cognition, on the other hand, the chief concern is the necessity of a concept, and the route by which it has become a result [is] its proof and deduction. Thus, given that its content is necessary for itself, the second step is to look around for what corresponds to it in our ideas [Vorstellungen] and language. But this concept as it is for itself in its truth may not only be different from our representation [Vorstellung] of it: the two must also differ in their form and shape. If, however, the representation is not also false in its content, the concept may well be shown to be contained in it and present in essence within it; that is, the representation may be raised to the form of the concept. But it is so far from being the measure and criterion of the concept which is necessary and true for itself that it must rather derive its truth from the concept, and recognize and correct itself with the help of the latter. – But if, on the other hand, the former manner of cognition with its formal definitions, inferences, proofs, and the like has now virtually disappeared, the other mode which has replaced it is a bad substitute: that is, Ideas in general, and hence also the Idea of right and its further determinations, are taken up and asserted in immediate fashion as facts of consciousness, and our natural or intensified feelings, our own heart and enthusiasm, are made the source of right.4 If this is the most convenient method of all, it is also the least philosophical – not to mention here other aspects of this view, which has immediate relevance [Beziehung] to action and not just to cognition. Whereas the first – admittedly formal – method does at least require the form of the concept in its definitions and the form of necessary cognition in its proofs, the mode of immediate consciousness and feeling makes the subjectivity, contingency, and arbitrariness of knowledge into its principle. – A familiarity with the nature of scientific procedure in philosophy, as expounded in philosophical logic, is here presupposed.

§ 3
Right is in general positive (a) through its form of having validity within a [particular] state; and this legal authority is the principle which underlies knowledge [Kenntnis] of right, i.e. the positive science of right. (b) In terms of content, this right acquires a positive element (α) through the particular national character of a people, its stage of historical development, and the whole context of relations governed by natural necessity;1 (β) through the necessity whereby a system of legal right must contain the application of the universal concept to the particular and externally given characteristics of objects [Gegenstände] and instances – an application which is no longer [a matter of] speculative thought and the development of the concept, but [of] subsumption by the understanding; (γ) through the final determinations required for making decisions in actuality.

If the feelings of the heart, [personal] inclinations, and arbitrariness are set up in opposition to positive right and laws, philosophy at least cannot recognize such authorities. That force and tyranny may be an element in positive right is contingent to the latter, and has nothing to do with its nature. Later in this work (§§ 211–214), it will be shown at what point right must become positive. The determinations which will be discussed in that context are mentioned here only in order to indicate the limits [Grenze] of philosophical right and at the same time to rule out any possible idea [Vorstellung], let alone expectation, that its systematic development should give rise to a positive code of laws such as is required by an actual state. – Natural law or philosophical right is different from positive right, but it would be a grave misunderstanding to distort this difference into an opposition or antagonism; on the contrary, their relation is like that between Institutes and Pandects.2 – With regard to the historical element in positive right (first referred to in § 3 above), Montesquieu stated the true historical view, the genuinely philosophical viewpoint, that legislation in general and its particular determinations should not be considered in isolation and in the abstract, but rather as a dependent moment within one totality, in the context of all the other determinations which constitute the character of a nation and age; within this context they gain their genuine significance, and hence also their justification.3 – To consider the emergence and development of determinations of right as they appear in time is a purely historical task. This task, like that of recognizing the logical consistency of such determinations by comparing them with previously existing legal relations, is meritorious and praiseworthy within its own sphere, and bears no relation to the philosophical approach – unless, that is to say, development from historical grounds is confused with development from the concept, and the significance of historical explanation and justification is extended to include a justification which is valid in and for itself4. This distinction, which is very important and should be firmly borne in mind, is at the same time a very obvious one; a determination of right may be shown to be entirely grounded in and consistent with the prevailing circumstances and existing legal institutions, yet it may be contrary to right [unrechtlich] and irrational in and for itself, like numerous determinations of Roman civil law [Privatrecht] which followed quite consistently from such institutions as Roman paternal authority and Roman matrimony. But even if the determinations of right are rightful and rational, it is one thing to demonstrate that this is so – and this cannot truly be done except by means of the concept – and another to depict their historical emergence and the circumstances, eventualities, needs, and incidents which led to their introduction. This kind of demonstration and (pragmatic) cognition in terms of proximate or remote historical causes is often called ‘explanation’, or even more commonly ‘comprehension’, in the belief [Meinung] that this kind of historical demonstration is all – or rather, the one essential thing – that needs to be done in order to comprehend the law or a legal institution, whereas in fact the truly essential issue, the concept of the thing [Sache], has not even been mentioned. – Similarly, we often hear talk of Roman or Germanic ‘concepts of right’, or of such ‘concepts of right’ as are defined in this or that legal code, although these codes contain no reference to concepts, but only to general determinations of right, propositions of the understanding, principles, laws, and the like. – By disregarding the difference in question, it becomes possible to shift the point of view and to turn the request for a true justification into a justification by circumstances, a logical deduction from premises which may in themselves [für sich] be as valueless as the conclusions derived from them, etc.; in short, the relative is put in place of the absolute, and the external appearance in place of the nature of the thing [Sache] itself. When a historical justification confuses an origin in external factors with an origin in the concept, it unconsciously achieves the opposite of what it intends. If it can be shown that the origin of an institution was entirely expedient and necessary under the specific circumstances of the time, the requirements of the historical viewpoint are fulfilled. But if this is supposed to amount to a general justification of the thing itself, the result is precisely the opposite; for since the original circumstances are no longer present, the institution has thereby lost its meaning and its right [to exist]. Thus if, for example, the monasteries are justified by an appeal to their services in cultivating and populating areas of wilderness and in preserving scholarship through instruction, copying of manuscripts, etc., and these services are regarded as the reason [Grund] and purpose [Bestimmung] of their continued existence, what in fact follows from these past services is that, since the circumstances have now changed completely, the monasteries have, at least in this respect, become superfluous and inappropriate. – Since it has now been shown that the historical significance of origins, along with their historical demonstration and exposition, belongs to a different sphere from the philosophical view of the same origins and of the concept of the thing, the two approaches can to that extent remain indifferent to one another. But since they do not always maintain such peaceful relations, even in scientific matters, I shall quote something relating to their mutual contact which appears in Herr [Gustav] Hugo’s Textbook of the History of Roman Law [Lehrbuch der Geschichte des römischen Rechts, 1790], and which will also further elucidate their supposed mode of opposition.5 Herr Hugo points out in the passage in question (fifth edition [1818], § 53) ‘that Cicero praises the Twelve Tables, while looking askance at the philosophers’,6 whereas ‘the philosopher Favorinus treats them just as many a great philosopher has subsequently treated positive right’. In the same context, Herr Hugo replies once and for all to such treatment with the explanation that ‘Favorinus understood the Twelve Tables just as little as the philosophers have understood positive right’. – As to the correction of the philosopher Favorinus by the jurist Sextus Caecilius in [Aulus] Gellius’ Noctes Atticae, XX, 1, it is primarily a statement of the true and lasting principle which must underlie the justification of anything whose impact is merely positive.7 ‘Non ignoras’, says Caecilius very aptly to Favorinus, ‘legum opportunitates et medelas pro temporum moribus et pro rerum publicarum generibus ac pro utilitatum praesentium rationibus, proque vitiorum, quibus medendum est, fervoribus, mutari ac flecti, neque uno statu consistere, quin, ut facies coeli et maris, ita rerum atque fortunae tempestatibus varientur. Quid salubrius visum est rogatione illa Stolonis . . . quid utilius plebiscito Voconio . . . quid tam necessarium existimatum est . . . quam lex Licinia . . . ? Omnia tamen haec obliterata et operta sunt civitatis opulentia . . .’a These laws are positive in so far as their significance and appropriateness are circumstantial and their value is therefore entirely historical; they are accordingly of a transient nature. The wisdom of what legislators and governments have done for the circumstances of their time and laid down for the conditions under which they lived is a distinct issue [eine Sache für sich] which should be assessed by history, whose recognition of it will be all the more profound if such an assessment is supported by philosophical insights. I shall, however, cite an example of Caecilius’ further attempts to justify the Twelve Tables against Favorinus, because in so doing, he employs the eternally deceptive method of the understanding and its mode of ratiocination, namely by supplying a good reason [Grund] for a bad thing [Sache] and believing that the latter has thereby been justified. He mentions the abominable law which, after a specified interval had elapsed, gave the creditor the right to kill the debtor or to sell him into slavery, or even, if there were several creditors, to cut pieces off him and so divide him between them that, if anyone had cut off too much or too little, he should incur no consequent legal disadvantagea (a clause which would have benefited Shakespeare’s Shylock in The Merchant of Venice and which he would most gratefully have accepted).11 In support of this law, Caecilius puts forward the good reason that it provided an additional guarantee of good faith and that, given the abominable nature of the law, it was never intended that it should be enforced.12 In his thoughtlessness, he not only fails to reflect that this latter provision [Bestimmung] frustrates the former intention, namely that the law should guarantee good faith, but also overlooks the fact that he himself cites an example immediately afterwards of how the law on false witness was rendered ineffectual by its excessive severity. – But it is not clear what Herr Hugo means when he says that Favorinus did not understand the law; any schoolboy is capable of understanding it, and Shylock would have understood better than anyone else the clause in question, which would have been of so much advantage to him; by ‘understanding’, Herr Hugo must have meant only that degree [Bildung] of understanding which is satisfied if a good reason can be found for such a law. – Incidentally, a further misunderstanding of which Caecilius convicts Favorinus in the same context is one to which a philosopher may readily confess without blushing – namely his failure to realize that iumentum, which the law specified, ‘as distinct from arcera’, as the only mode of transport to be provided to bring a sick man as witness to the court, should be understood to signify not only a horse but also a coach or wagon.13 Caecilius was able to derive from this legal determination a further proof of the excellence and precision of the old laws, for in determining how a sick witness was to be summoned to testify in court, they even went so far as to distinguish not just between a horse and a wagon, but even between different kinds of wagon – between a covered and upholstered wagon, as Caecilius explains, and a less comfortable one. We would thus be left with a choice between the severity of the original law and the triviality of such determinations; but to describe such things, let alone learned expositions of them, as ‘trivial’, would be among the greatest possible affronts to scholarship of this and other kinds.

But in the textbook cited above, Herr Hugo also has occasion to speak of rationality in connection with Roman law, and I was particularly struck by the following points. In his treatment of the period from the origin of the state to the Twelve Tables (§§ 38 and 39), he says that ‘people (in Rome) had many needs and were obliged to work, requiring the assistance of draught animals and beasts of burden such as we ourselves possess, that the territory of Rome consisted of alternate hills and valleys, that the city stood on a hill, etc. – allusions which were perhaps meant to fulfil the intentions of Montesquieu, but which will scarcely be found to have captured the latter’s spirit. He then points out (§ 40) ‘that the position with regard to right was still very far from satisfying the highest demands of reason’. (This is quite correct; Roman family law [Familienrecht], slavery, etc. do not satisfy even the most modest demands of reason.) But in dealing with later periods, Herr Hugo forgets to tell us in which of them, if any, Roman law satisfied the highest demands of reason. In § 289, however, Herr Hugo says of the classical jurists in the period of the highest development [Ausbildung] of Roman law as a science ‘that it has long since been noticed that the classical jurists had a philosophical education’; but ‘few people are aware’ (although the many editions of Herr Hugo’s textbook have ensured that more people are now aware) ‘that no category of writers is so eminently deserving as these same Roman jurists to be likened to the mathematicians in respect of logical deduction from first principles or to the new founder of metaphysics in respect of the strikingly distinctive way in which they develop their concepts – the latter being confirmed by the remarkable fact that there are nowhere so many trichotomies as in the classical jurists and in Kant’. – That logical consistency which Leibniz praises is certainly an essential characteristic of the science of right, as of mathematics and every other science of the understanding; but this logical consistency of the understanding has nothing to do with the satisfaction of the demands of reason and with philosophical science.14 Apart from this, however, the very inconsistency of the Roman jurists and praetors should be regarded as one of their greatest virtues, for it enabled them to dissociate themselves from unjust and abominable institutions, although they were at the same time compelled to invent verbal distinctions on the slya (as when they called bonorum possessio what nevertheless amounted to an inheritance)15 and even silly excuses (and silliness is equally an inconsistency) in order to preserve the letter of the Twelve Tables, for example by the fiction or pretenceb that a daughter was a sonc (see [J. G.] Heineccius, Antiquitatum Romanarum . . . liber 1 [Frankfurt, 1771], tit. II, § 24). 16 – But it is ludicrous to see the classical jurists lumped together with Kant because of a few trichotomous divisions – particularly those cited in Note 5 to Herr Hugo’s remarks – and to see this kind of thing called ‘development of concepts’.

§ 4
The basis [Boden] of right is the realm of spirit in general and its precise location and point of departure is the will; the will is free, so that freedom constitutes its substance and destiny [Bestimmung] and the system of right is the realm of actualized freedom, the world of spirit produced from within itself as a second nature.

Addition (H,G). The freedom of the will can best be explained by reference to physical nature. For freedom is just as much a basic determination of the will as weight is a basic determination of bodies. If matter is described as heavy, one might think that this predicate is merely contingent; but this is not so, for nothing in matter is weightless: on the contrary, matter is weight itself. Heaviness constitutes the body and is the body. It is just the same with freedom and the will, for that which is free is the will. Will without freedom is an empty word, just as freedom is actual only as will or as subject. But as for the connection between the will and thought, the following remarks are necessary. Spirit is thought in general, and the human being is distinguished from the animal by thought. But it must not be imagined [sich vorstellen] that a human being thinks on the one hand and wills on the other, and that he has thought in one pocket and volition in the other, for this would be an empty representation [Vorstellung]. The distinction between thought and will is simply that between theoretical and practical attitudes. But they are not two separate faculties; on the contrary, the will is a particular way of thinking – thinking translating itself into existence [Dasein], thinking as the drive to give itself existence. This distinction between thought and will can be expressed as follows. When I think of an object [Gegenstand], I make it into a thought and deprive it of its sensuous quality; I make it into something which is essentially and immediately mine. For it is only when I think that I am with myself [bei mir], and it is only by comprehending it that I can penetrate an object; it then no longer stands opposed to me, and I have deprived it of that quality of its own which it had for itself in opposition to me. Just as Adam says to Eve: ‘You are flesh of my flesh and bone of my bone’,1 so does spirit say: ‘This is spirit of my spirit, and its alien character has disappeared.’ Every representation [Vorstellung] is a generalization, and this is inherent in thought. To generalize something means to think it. ‘I’ is thought and likewise the universal. When I say ‘I’, I leave out of account every particularity such as my character, temperament, knowledge [Kenntnisse], and age. ‘I’ is totally empty; it is merely a point – simple, yet active in this simplicity. The colourful canvas of the world is before me; I stand opposed to it and in this [theoretical] attitude I overcome [aufhebe] its opposition and make its content my own. ‘I’ is at home in the world when it knows it, and even more so when it has comprehended it. So much for the theoretical attitude. The practical attitude, on the other hand, begins with thought, with the ‘I’ itself, and seems at first to be opposed [to the world] because it immediately sets up a separation. In so far as I am practical or active, i.e. in so far as I act, I determine myself, and to determine myself means precisely to posit a difference. But these differences which I posit are nevertheless also mine, the determinations apply to me, and the ends to which I am impelled belong to me. Now even if I let go of these determinations and differences, i.e. if I posit them in the so-called external world, they still remain mine: they are what I have done or made, and they bear the imprint of my mind [Geist]. This, then, is the distinction between theoretical and practical attitudes; the relationship between them must now be described. The theoretical is essentially contained within the practical; the idea [Vorstellung] that the two are separate must be rejected, for one cannot have a will without intelligence. On the contrary, the will contains the theoretical within itself. The will determines itself, and this determination is primarily of an inward nature, for what I will I represent to myself as my object [Gegenstand]. The animal acts by instinct, it is impelled by something inward and is therefore also practical; but it has no will, because it does not represent to itself what it desires. It is equally impossible to adopt a theoretical attitude or to think without a will, for in thinking we are necessarily active. The content of what is thought certainly takes on the form of being; but this being is something mediated, something posited by our activity. These distinct attitudes are therefore inseparable: they are one and the same thing, and both moments can be found in every activity, of thinking and willing alike.

With regard to the freedom of the will, we may recollect the older method of cognition. It simply presupposed the representation [Vorstellung] of the will and attempted to set up a definition of the will by extracting it from this representation; then, in the manner of the older empirical psychology, the so-called proof of the will’s freedom was derived from the various feelings and phenomena [Empfindungen und Erscheinungen] of ordinary consciousness, such as remorse, guilt, and the like, which could allegedly be explained only in terms of a free will. But it is more convenient simply to adhere to the notion that freedom is given as a fact of consciousness in which we must simply believe.2 The deduction that the will is free and of what the will and freedom are – as already remarked in § 2 above – is possible only within the context of the whole [of philosophy]. The basic features of this premise are that spirit is initially intelligence and that the determinations through which it proceeds in its development, from feeling to representational thinking [Vorstellen] to thought, are the way by which it produces itself as will – which, as practical spirit in general, is the proximate truth of intelligence. I have given an account of these matters in my Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences (Heidelberg, 1817), §§ 363–399, and hope to deal with them in greater detail on a future occasion.3 It is all the more necessary for me to contribute in this way to what I hope will be a more thorough cognition of the nature of spirit, because, as I pointed out in the Encyclopaedia (Remarks to § 367), it is hard to imagine that any philosophical science can be in so bad and neglected a condition as that doctrine of spirit which is usually called ‘psychology’.4 – And as for those elements [Momente] of the concept of the will which are mentioned in this and the following paragraphs of the Introduction and which result from the premise referred to above, it is possible to form an idea [Vorstellen] of them by consulting the selfconsciousness of any individual. In the first place, anyone can discover in himself an ability to abstract from anything whatsoever, and likewise to determine himself, to posit any content in himself by his own agency; and he will likewise have examples of the further determinations [of the will] within his selfconsciousness.

§ 5
The will contains (α) the element of pure indeterminacy or of the ‘I’’s pure reflection into itself, in which every limitation, every content, whether present immediately through nature, through needs, desires, and drives, or given and determined in some other way, is dissolved; this is the limitless infinity of absolute abstraction or universality, the pure thinking of oneself.

Those who regard thinking as a particular and distinct faculty, divorced from the will as an equally distinct faculty, and who in addition even consider that thinking is prejudicial to the will – especially the good will – show from the very outset that they are totally ignorant of the nature of the will (a remark which we shall often have occasion to make on this same subject).1 – Only one aspect of the will is defined here – namely this absolute possibility of abstracting from every determination in which I find myself or which I have posited in myself, the flight from every content as a limitation. If the will determines itself in this way, or if representational thought [die Vorstellung] considers this aspect in itself [für sich] as freedom and holds fast to it, this is negative freedom or the freedom of the understanding. – This is the freedom of the void, which is raised to the status of an actual shape and passion. If it remains purely theoretical, it becomes in the religious realm the Hindu fanaticism of pure contemplation;2 but if it turns to actuality, it becomes in the realm of both politics and religion the fanaticism of destruction, demolishing the whole existing social order, eliminating all individuals regarded as suspect by a given order, and annihilating any organization which attempts to rise up anew.3 Only in destroying something does this negative will have a feeling of its own existence [Dasein]. It may well believe that it wills some positive condition, for instance the condition of universal equality or of universal religious life, but it does not in fact will the positive actuality of this condition, for this at once gives rise to some kind of order, a particularization both of institutions and of individuals; but it is precisely through the annihilation of particularity and of objective determination that the self-consciousness of this negative freedom arises. Thus, whatever such freedom believes [meint] that it wills can in itself [für sich] be no more than an abstract representation [Vorstellung], and its actualization can only be the fury of destruction.

Addition (H,G). It is inherent in this element of the will that I am able to free myself from everything, to renounce all ends, and to abstract from everything.4 The human being alone is able to abandon all things, even his own life: he can commit suicide. The animal cannot do this; it always remains only negative, in a determination which is alien to it and to which it merely grows accustomed. The human being is pure thinking of himself, and only in thinking is he this power to give himself universality, that is, to extinguish all particularity, all determinacy. This negative freedom or freedom of the understanding is one-sided, but this one-sidedness always contains within itself an essential determination and should therefore not be dismissed; but the defect of the understanding is that it treats a one-sided determination as unique and elevates it to supreme status. This form of freedom occurs frequently in history. The Hindus, for example, place the highest value on mere persistence in the knowledge of one’s simple identity with oneself, on remaining within this empty space of one’s inwardness like colourless light in pure intuition, and on renouncing every activity of life, every end, and every representation [Vorstellung]. In this way, the human being becomes Brahman. There is no longer any distinction between the finite human being and Brahman; instead, every difference [Differenz] has disappeared in this universality. This form [of freedom] appears more concretely in the active fanaticism of both political and religious life. An example of this was the Reign of Terror in the French Revolution, during which all differences of talents and authority were supposed to be cancelled out [aufgehoben]. This was a time of trembling and quaking and of intolerance towards everything particular. For fanaticism wills only what is abstract, not what is articulated, so that whenever differences emerge, it finds them incompatible with its own indeterminacy and cancels them [hebt sie auf]. This is why the people, during the French Revolution, destroyed once more the institutions they had themselves created, because all institutions are incompatible with the abstract self-consciousness of equality.

§ 6
(β) In the same way, ‘I’ is the transition from undifferentiated indeterminacy to differentiation, determination, and the positing of a determinacy as a content and object. – This content may further be given by nature, or generated by the concept of spirit. Through this positing of itself as something determinate, ‘I’ steps into existence [Dasein] in general – the absolute moment of the finitude or particularization of the ‘I’.

This second moment of determination is just as much negativity and cancellation [Aufheben] as the first – for it is the cancellation of the first abstract negativity. – Just as the particular is in general contained within the universal, so in consequence is this second moment already contained within the first and is merely a positing of what the first already is in itself. The first moment – that is, the first as it is for itself – is not true infinity or the concrete universality of the concept, but only something determinate and one-sided. For since it is abstraction from all determinacy, it is itself not without determinacy; and the fact that it is abstract and one-sided constitutes its determinacy, deficiency, and finitude. – The differentiation and determination of the two moments referred to is to be found in the philosophy of Fichte and likewise in that of Kant etc., except that in Fichte – to confine ourselves to his presentation – ‘I’, as the unbounded (in the first proposition of his Theory of Knowledge [Wissenschaftslehre]), is taken purely and simply as something positive (and thus as the universality and identity of the understanding). Consequently, this abstract ‘I’ for itself is supposed to be the truth; and limitation – i.e. the negative in general, whether as a given external limit or as an activity of the ‘I’ itself – is therefore something added to it (in the second proposition).1 – The further step which speculative philosophy had to take was to apprehend the negativity which is immanent within the universal or the identical, as in the ‘I’ – a step the need for which is not perceived by those who fail to apprehend the dualism of infinity and finitude, even in that immanent and abstract form in which Fichte understood it.

Addition (H,G). This second moment appears as the opposing one. It is to be apprehended in its universal mode: it belongs to freedom, but does not constitute the whole of freedom. The ‘I’ here emerges from undifferentiated indeterminacy to become differentiated, to posit something determinate as its content and object [Gegenstand]. I do not merely will – I will something. A will which, as described in the previous paragraph, wills only the abstract universal, wills nothing and is therefore not a will at all. The particular [thing] which the will wills is a limitation, for the will, in order to be a will, must in some way limit itself. The fact that the will wills something is the limit or negation. Thus particularization is what as a rule is called finitude. Reflective thought usually regards the first moment, namely the indeterminate, as the absolute and higher moment, and conversely regards the limited as a mere negation of this indeterminacy. But this indeterminacy is itself merely a negation with regard to the determinate, to finitude: ‘I’ is this solitude and absolute negation. The indeterminate will is to this extent just as one-sided as that which exists in mere determinacy.

§ 7
(γ) The will is the unity of both these moments – particularity reflected into itself and thereby restored to universality. It is individuality [Einzelheit], the self-determination of the ‘I’, in that it posits itself as the negative of itself, that is, as determinate and limited, and at the same time remains with itself [bei sich], that is, in its identity with itself and universality; and in this determination, it joins together with itself alone. – ‘I’ determines itself in so far as it is the self-reference of negativity. As this reference to itself, it is likewise indifferent to this determinacy; it knows the latter as its own and as ideal, as a mere possibility by which it is not restricted but in which it finds itself merely because it posits itself in it. – This is the freedom of the will, which constitutes the concept or substantiality of the will, its gravity, just as gravity constitutes the substantiality of a body.

Every self-consciousness knows itself as universal, as the possibility of abstracting from everything determinate, and as particular, with a determinate object [Gegenstand], content, and end. But these two moments are only abstractions; what is concrete and true (and everything true is concrete) is the universality which has the particular as its opposite, but this particular, through its reflection into itself, has been reconciled [ausgeglichen] with the universal. This unity is individuality, but not in its immediacy as a single unit – as in our common idea [Vorstellung] of individuality – but rather in accordance with the concept of individuality (see Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences, §§ 112–114);1 in other words, this individuality is in fact none other than the concept itself. The first two moments – that the will can abstract from everything and that it is also determined (by itself or by something else) – are easy to accept and grasp, because they are, in themselves [für sich], moments of the understanding and devoid of truth. But it is the third moment, the true and speculative (and everything true, in so far as it is comprehended, can be thought of only speculatively), which the understanding refuses to enter into, because the concept is precisely what the understanding always describes as incomprehensible. The task of proving and explaining in more detail this innermost insight of speculation – that is, infinity as self-referring negativity, this ultimate source of all activity, life, and consciousness – belongs to logic as purely speculative philosophy. – The only thing which remains to be noted here is that, when we say that the will is universal and that the will determines itself, we speak as if the will were already assumed to be a subject or substratum. But the will is not complete and universal until it is determined, and until this determination is superseded and idealized; it does not become will until it is this self-mediating activity and this return into itself.

Addition (H). What is properly called the will contains both the preceding moments. ‘I’ as such is primarily pure activity, the universal which is with itself [bei sich]; but this universal determines itself, and to that extent is no longer with itself but posits itself as an other and ceases to be the universal. Then the third moment is that ‘I’ is with itself in its limitation, in this other; as it determines itself, it nevertheless still remains with itself and does not cease to hold fast to the universal. This, then, is the concrete concept of freedom, whereas the two previous moments have been found to be thoroughly abstract and one-sided. But we already possess this freedom in the form of feeling [Empfindung], for example in friendship and love.2 Here, we are not one-sidedly within ourselves, but willingly limit ourselves with reference to an other, even while knowing ourselves in this limitation as ourselves. In this determinacy, the human being should not feel determined; on the contrary, he attains his self-awareness only by regarding the other as other. Thus, freedom lies neither in indeterminacy nor in determinacy, but is both at once. The will which limits itself exclusively to a this is the will of the stubborn person who considers himself unfree unless he has this will. But the will is not tied to something limited; on the contrary, it must proceed further, for the nature of the will is not this one-sidedness and restriction. Freedom is to will something determinate, yet to be with oneself [bei sich] in this determinacy and to return once more to the universal.

§ 8
The further determination of particularization (see § 6 above) constitutes the difference between the forms of the will: (a) in so far as determinacy is the formal [formelle] opposition between the subjective on the one hand and the objective as external immediate existence [Existenz] on the other, this is the formal [formale]a will as self-consciousness, which finds an external world outside itself. As individuality [Einzelheit] returning in determinacy into itself, it is the process of translating the subjective end into objectivity through the mediation of activity and of a[n external] means. In the spirit as it is in and for itself, whereby its determinacy is absolutely true and its own (see Encyclopaedia, § 363),1 the relation of consciousness constitutes no more than the aspect of the will’s appearance. This aspect will not be separately [für sich] considered any further here.

Addition (H). The consideration of the will’s determinacy is the task of the understanding and is not primarily speculative. The will is determined by no means only in the sense of content, but also in the sense of form. Its determinacy with regard to form is its end and the accomplishment of its end. At first this end is only subjective and internal to me, but it should also become objective and throw off the deficiency of mere subjectivity. One may ask here why it has this deficiency. If that which is deficient does not at the same time stand above its deficiency, then its deficiency does not exist for it. For us an animal is deficient, but not for itself. In so far as an end is still only ours, it is for us a deficiency, for to us, freedom and will are the unity of the subjective and the objective. Hence the end must be posited objectively, and it thereby attains not a new one-sided determination but only its realization.

§ 9
(b) In so far as the will’s determinations are its own – that is, its internally reflected particularization in general – they are its content. This content, as the content of the will, is its end in accordance with the form specified under (a) above – either its inner or subjective end as represented in the act of willing, or its end as actualized and accomplished through the mediation of its activity as it translates the subjective into objectivity.

§ 10
This content, or the distinct determination of the will, is primarily immediate. Thus, the will is free only in itself or for us, or it is in general the will in its concept. Only when the will has itself as its object [Gegenstand] is it for itself what it is in itself.

Finitude, according to this determination, consists in the fact that what something is in itself or in accordance with its concept is different in its existence [Existenz] or appearance from what it is for itself; thus, for example, in itself the abstract mutual externality of nature is space, but for itself it is time. Two points should be noted in this connection: first that, because the true is simply the Idea, we do not yet possess an object or determination in its truth if we grasp it only as it is in itself or in its concept; and secondly, that something as concept or in itself likewise exists, and this existence [Existenz] is a shape proper to the object (as with space in the above example). The separation which is present in the finite world between being-in-itself and being-for-itself at the same time constitutes the finite world’s mere existence [Dasein] or appearance (immediate examples of this will arise in connection with the natural will and then with formal right, etc.). The understanding stops at mere being-in-itself and therefore calls freedom in accordance with this being-in-itself a faculty [Vermögen], since it is indeed in this case a mere potentiality [Möglichkeit]. But the understanding regards this determination as absolute and perennial, and takes the relationship [Beziehung] of freedom to what it wills, or in general to its reality, merely as its application to a given material, an application which does not belong to the essence of freedom itself. In this way, the understanding has to do with the abstract alone, not with the Idea and truth of freedom.1

Addition (G). The will which is a will only in accordance with its concept is free in itself but at the same time unfree, for it would be truly free only as a truly determinate content; in the latter case, it is free for itself, has freedom as its object, and is freedom. Whatever is still only in accordance with its concept, whatever is merely in itself, is only immediate, only natural. We are also familiar with this in representational thought [in der Vorstellung]. The child is in itself a human being; it has reason only in itself, it is only the potentiality of reason and freedom, and is therefore free only in accordance with its concept. Now what exists as yet only in itself does not exist in its actuality. The human being who is rational in himself must work through the process of self-production both by going out of himself and by educating himself inwardly, in order that he may also become rational for himself.

§ 11
The will which is free as yet only in itself is the immediate or natural will. The determinations of the difference which is posited within the will by the self-determining concept appear within the immediate will as an immediately present content: these are the drives, desires, and inclinations by which the will finds itself naturally determined. This content, along with the determinations developed within it, does indeed originate in the will’s rationality and it is thus rational in itself; but expressed in so immediate a form, it does not yet have the form of rationality.1 For me, this content is admittedly entirely mine; but this form and that content are still different, so that the will is a finite will within itself.

Empirical psychology relates and describes these drives and inclinations and the needs derived from them as it encounters them, or believes it encounters them, in experience, and attempts to classify this given material in the usual way. We shall discuss below what the objective element of these drives is, what shape this element assumes in its truth (without the form of irrationality which it possesses as drive), and also what shape it assumes in its existence [Existenz].

Addition (H). The animal, too, has drives, desires, and inclinations, but it has no will and must obey its drive if nothing external prevents it. But the human being, as wholly indeterminate, stands above his drives and can determine and posit them as his own. The drive is part of nature, but to posit it in this ‘I’ depends upon my will, which therefore cannot appeal to the fact that the drive is grounded in nature.

§ 12
The system of this content as it is already present in its immediacy in the will exists only as a multitude of varied drives, each of which is mine in general along with others, and at the same time something universal and indeterminate which has all kinds of objects [Gegenstände] and can be satisfied in all kinds of ways. Inasmuch as the will, in this double indeterminacy, gives itself the form of individuality [Einzelheit] (see § 7), it is a resolving will, and only in so far as it makes any resolutions at all is it an actual will.

To resolve on something [etwas beschließenf]a is to cancel [aufheben] that indeterminacy in which each and every content is initially no more than a possibility. But our language also contains the alternative expression sich entschließen [‘to decide’],b which indicates that the indeterminacy of the will itself, as something neutral yet infinitely fruitful, the original seed of all existence [Dasein], contains its determinations and ends within itself, and merely brings them forth from within.

§ 13
By resolving, the will posits itself as the will of a specific individual and as a will which distinguishes itself from everything else. But apart from this finitude as consciousness (see § 8), the immediate will, because of the difference between its form and its content (see § 11), is purely formal; its only appropriate function is that of abstract resolution, and its content is not yet the content and product of its freedom.

In so far as intelligence is a thinking power, its object [Gegenstand] and content remain universal and the intelligence itself behaves as a universal activity. In the will, the universal also means essentially ‘that which is mine’, as individuality [Einzelheit]; and in the immediate, i.e. formal will, it signifies abstract individuality which is not yet filled with its free universality. It is therefore in the will that the proper [eigene] finitude of intelligence begins, and it is only by raising itself once more to the level of thought and by conferring immanent universality upon its ends that the will cancels [aufhebt] the difference of form and content and makes itself objective, infinite will. Thus those who believe that the human being is infinite in the realm of the will in general, but that he – or reason itself – is limited in the realm of thought, have little understanding of the nature of thinking and willing.1 In so far as thinking and willing are still distinct, it is rather the converse which is true, and thinking reason, as will, is [reason] deciding [sich entschließen] on its own finitude.

Addition (H). A will which resolves on nothing is not an actual will; the characterless man can never resolve on anything. The reason [Grund] for such indecision may also lie in an over-refined sensibility which knows that, in determining something, it enters the realm of finitude, imposing a limit on itself and relinquishing infinity; yet it does not wish to renounce the totality which it intends. Such a disposition [Gemüt] is dead, even if its aspiration is to be beautiful.2 ‘Whoever aspires to great things’, says Goethe, ‘must be able to limit himself’.3 Only by making resolutions can the human being enter actuality, however painful the process may be; for inertia would rather not emerge from that inward brooding in whicha it reserves a universal possibility for itself. But possibility is not yet actuality. The will which is sure of itself does not therefore lose itself in what it determines.

§ 14
The finite will, purely with regard to its form, is the self-reflecting infinite ‘I’ which is with itself [bei sich selbst] (see § 5). As such, it stands above its content, i.e. its various drives, and also above the further individual ways in which these are actualized and satisfied. At the same time, since it is only formally infinite, it is tied to this content as to the determinations of its nature and of its external actuality (see §§ 6 and 11); but since it is indeterminate, it is not restricted to this or that content in particular. To this extent, this content is only a possible one for the reflection of the ‘I’ into itself; it may or may not be mine; and ‘I’ is the possibility of determining myself to this or to something else, of choosing between these determinations which the ‘I’ must in this respect regard as external.1

§ 15
The freedom of the will, according to this determination, is arbitrariness, in which the following two factors are contained: free reflection, which abstracts from everything, and dependence on an inwardly or externally given content and material. Since this content, which is necessary in itself as an end, is at the same time determined as a possible content in opposition to free reflection, it follows that arbitrariness is contingency in the shape of will.

The commonest idea [Vorstellung] we have of freedom is that of arbitrariness – the mean position of reflection between the will as determined solely by natural drives and the will which is free in and for itself. When we hear it said that freedom in general consists in being able to do as one pleases, such an idea [Vorstellung] can only be taken to indicate a complete lack of intellectual culture [Bildung des Gedankens]; for it shows not the least awareness of what constitutes the will which is free in and for itself, or right, or ethics, etc. Reflection, the formal universality and unity of self-consciousness, is the will’s abstract certainty of its freedom, but it is not yet the truth of this freedom, because it does not yet have itself as its content and end, so that the subjective side is still something other than the objective [die gegenständliche]; the content of this self-determination therefore also remains purely and simply finite. Instead of being the will in its truth, arbitrariness is rather the will as contradiction. – In the controversy which arose chiefly at the time of Wolff’s metaphysics as to whether the will is actually free or whether our knowledge of its freedom is merely a delusion, it was arbitrariness which people had in mind.1 To the certainty of this abstract self-determination, determinism rightly opposed the content, which, as something encountered, is not contained in that certainty and therefore comes to it from outside – although ‘outside’ here denotes drive or representation [Vorstellung], or simply the fact that the consciousness is filled in such a way that its content is not derived from its own self-determining activity as such. Accordingly, since only the formal element of free self-determination is immanent within arbitrariness, whereas the other element is something given to it, arbitrariness may indeed be called a delusion if it is supposed to be equivalent to freedom. In all reflective philosophy, as in that of Kant and subsequently in Fries’s utterly superficial revision of it, freedom is nothing other than this formal self-activity.2

Addition (H). Since I have the possibility of determining myself in this or that direction – that is, since I am able to choose – I possess an arbitrary will, and this is what is usually called freedom. The choice which I have lies in the universality of the will, whereby I can make this or that [thing] mine. This [thing] which is mine is a particular content and is therefore incompatible with me; thus it is separate from me and is only potentially mine, just as I am only the potentiality of uniting with it. The choice therefore lies in the indeterminacy of the ‘I’ and the determinacy of the content. Because of this content, the will is consequently not free, although it has in itself the aspect of infinity in a formal sense. None of these contents is in keeping with it, and it does not truly have itself in any of them. It is inherent in arbitrariness that the content is not determined as mine by the nature of my will, but by contingency; thus I am also dependent on this content, and this is the contradiction which underlies arbitrariness. The common man thinks that he is free when he is allowed to act arbitrarily, but this very arbitrariness implies that he is not free. When I will what is rational, I act not as a particular [partikulares] individual, but in accordance with the concepts of ethics in general: in an ethical act, I vindicate not myself but the thing [die Sache]. But a person who does something perverse gives the greatest prominence to his particularity [Partikularität]. The rational is the high road which everyone follows and where no one stands out from the rest. When great artists complete a work, we can say that it had to be so; that is, the artist’s particularity has completely disappeared and no mannerism is apparent in it. Phidias has no mannerisms; the shape itself lives and stands out. But the poorer the artist is, the more we see of himself, of his particularity and arbitrariness.3 If we stop our enquiry at arbitrariness, at the human being’s ability to will this or that, this does indeed constitute his freedom; but if we bear firmly in mind that the content of what he wills is a given one, it follows that he is determined by it and is in this very respect no longer free.

§ 16
Whatever the will has decided to choose (see § 14), it can likewise relinquish (see § 5). But with this possibility of proceeding in turn beyond any other content which it may substitute for the previous one, and so on ad infinitum, it does not escape from finitude, because every such content is different from the form [of the will] and therefore finite; and the opposite of determinacy – namely indeterminacy, indecision, or abstraction – is only the other, equally one-sided moment.

§ 17
That contradiction which is the arbitrary will (see § 15) makes its appearance as a dialectic of drives and inclinations which conflict with each other in such a way that the satisfaction of one demands that the satisfaction of the other be subordinated or sacrificed, and so on; and since a drive is merely the simple direction of its own determinacy and therefore has no yardstick within itself, this determination that it should be subordinated or sacrificed is the contingent decision of arbitrariness – whether the latter is guided by calculations of the understanding as to which drive will afford the greater satisfaction, or by any other consideration one cares to name.

Addition (H). Drives or inclinations are primarily a content of the will, and only reflection stands above them; but these drives [Triebe] themselves become impelling [treibend], press upon each other, and conflict with each other, and all of them wish to be satisfied. If, then, I put all the others aside and commit myself to only one of them, I find myself in a destructive limitation, for by my very act I have relinquished my universality, which is a system of all drives. But it is of just as little help merely to subordinate certain drives [to others] – the course of action to which the understanding usually resorts – because no yardstick by which they might be arranged in order is available here; the demand for such an order therefore usually ends in tedious platitudes.1

§ 18
With regard to the judgement of drives the appearance of the dialectic is such that, as immanent and hence also positive, the determinations of the immediate will are good; thus man is said to be by nature good. But in so far as they are determinations of nature, opposed to freedom and to the concept of the spirit in general and therefore negative, they must be eradicated; thus man is said to be by nature evil. In this situation, the decision in favour of one assertion or the other likewise depends on subjective arbitrariness.1

Addition (H). The Christian doctrine that man is by nature evil is superior to the other according to which he is good. Interpreted philosophically, this doctrine should be understood as follows. As spirit, man is a free being [Wesen] who is in a position not to let himself be determined by natural drives. When he exists in an immediate and uncivilized [ungebildeten] condition, he is therefore in a situation in which he ought not to be, and from which he must liberate himself. This is the meaning of the doctrine of original sin, without which Christianity would not be the religion of freedom.

§ 19
Underlying the demand for the purification of the drives is the general idea [Vorstellung] that they should be freed from the form of their immediate natural determinacy and from the subjectivity and contingency of their content, and restored to their substantial essence. The truth behind this indeterminate demand is that the drives should become the rational system of the will’s determination; to grasp them thus in terms of the concept is the content of the science of right.

The content of this science can be expounded, with reference to all its individual moments such as right, property, morality, family, the state, etc., in the following form: man has by nature a drive towards right, and also a drive towards property and morality, and also a drive towards sexual love, a drive towards sociability, etc.1 If one prefers to accord the dignity of a philosophical shape to this form of empirical psychology, then this, in the light of what has passed in recent times for philosophy (as was earlier noted) and continues to pass for it, can be achieved at low cost simply by declaring that man finds within himself, as a fact of his consciousness, that he wills right, property, the state, etc. This same content, which appears here in the shape of drives, will recur later in another form, namely that of duties.2

§ 20
When reflection applies itself to the drives, representing them, estimating them, and comparing them with one another and then with the means they employ, their consequences etc., and with a sum total of satisfaction – i.e. with happiness1 – it confers formal universality upon this material and purifies it, in this external manner, of its crudity and barbarity. This cultivation of the universality of thought is the absolute value of education (cf. § 187).2

Addition (H). In happiness, thought already has some power over the natural force of the drives, for it is not content with the instantaneous, but requires a whole of happiness. This is connected with education to the extent that education likewise implements a universal. But two moments are present in the ideal of happiness: the first is a universal which is superior to all particularities; but secondly, since the content of this universal is in turn merely universal pleasure, the individual and particular, i.e. a finite quantity, reappears at this point, and we are compelled to return to the drive. Since the content of happiness lies in the subjectivity and feeling [Empfindung] of everyone, this universal end is itself particular [partikular], so that no true unity of content and form is yet present within it.

§ 21
The truth, however, of this formal universality, which is indeterminate for itself and encounters its determinacy in the material already mentioned, is self-determining universality, the will, or freedom. When the will has universality, or itself as infinite form, as its content, object [Gegenstand], and end, it is free not only in itself but also for itself – it is the Idea in its truth.1

The self-consciousness of the will, as desire and drive, is sensuous, just as the realm of the senses in general denotes externality and hence that condition in which self-consciousness is external to itself. The reflective will has two elements – this sensuous element and that of thinking universality; the will which has being in and for itself has as its object the will itself as such, and hence itself in its pure universality. This universality is such that the immediacy of the natural and the particularity [Partikularität] with which the natural is likewise invested when it is produced by reflection are superseded within it. But this process whereby the particular is superseded and raised to the universal is what is called the activity of thought. The self-consciousness which purifies and raises its object, content, and end to this universality does so as thought asserting itself in the will. Here is the point at which it becomes clear that it is only as thinking intelligence that the will is truly itself and free. The slave does not know his essence, his infinity and freedom; he does not know himself as an essence – he does not know himself as such, for he does not think himself. This self-consciousness which comprehends itself as essence through thought and thereby divests itself of the contingent and the untrue constitutes the principle of right, of morality, and of all ethics. Those who speak philosophically of right, morality, and ethics and at the same time seek to exclude thought, appealing instead to feeling, heart, emotion, and inspiration, bear witness to the profound contempt into which thought and science have fallen; for in their case, science itself, having sunk into despair and total lassitude, even adopts barbarism and thoughtlessness as its principle and does everything it can to rob mankind of all truth, worth, and dignity.

Addition (H). Truth in philosophy means that the concept corresponds to reality. A body, for example, is reality, and the soul is the concept. But soul and body ought to match one another; a dead body therefore still has an existence [Existenz], but no longer a true one, for it is a conceptless existence [Dasein]: that is why the dead body decomposes. The will in its truth is such that what it wills, i.e. its content, is identical with the will itself, so that freedom is willed by freedom.

§ 22
The will which has being in and for itself is truly infinite, because its object [Gegenstand] is itself, and therefore not something which it sees as other or as a limitation; on the contrary, it has merely returned into itself in its object. Furthermore, it is not just a possibility, predisposition, or capacity (potentia), but the infinite in actuality (infinitum actu), because the concept’s existence [Dasein] or objective [gegenständliche] externality is inwardness itself.

If one therefore speaks only of the free will as such, without specifying that it is the will which is free in and for itself, one is speaking only of the predisposition towards freedom or of the natural and finite will (see § 11), and therefore not – whatever one may say and believe – of the free will. – When the understanding regards the infinite merely as something negative and hence as beyond its sphere, it believes that it is doing the infinite all the more honour by pushing it ever further away and distancing it as something alien. In the free will, the truly infinite has actuality and presence – the will itself is the idea which is present within itself.1

Addition (H). Infinity has rightly been represented by the image of the circle, because a straight line runs on indefinitely and denotes that merely negative and false infinity which, unlike true infinity, does not return into itself. The free will is truly infinite, for it is not just a possibility and predisposition; on the contrary, its external existence is its inwardness, its own self.

§ 23
Only in this freedom is the will completely with itself [bei sich],1 because it has reference to nothing but itself, so that every relationship of dependence on something other than itself is thereby eliminated. – It is true, or rather it is truth itself, because its determination consists in being in its existence [Dasein] – i.e. as something opposed to itself – what it is in its concept; that is, the pure concept has the intuition of itself as its end and reality.

§ 24
It [the will] is universal, because all limitation and particular individuality [Einzelheit] are superseded within it. For these lie solely in the difference between the concept and its object [Gegenstand] or content, or, expressed in another form, in the difference between the will’s subjective being-for-itself and its being-in-itself, or between its exclusive and resolving individuality [on the one hand] and its universality itself [on the other].

The various determinations of universality are given in logic (see Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences, §§ 118–126).1 The first thing which the expression ‘universality’ suggests to representational thought [dem Vorstellen] is an abstract and external universality; but in the case of that universality which has being in and for itself, as defined here, we should think neither of the universality of reflection – i.e. communality or totality – nor of that abstract universality which stands outside and in opposition to the individual – i.e. the abstract identity of the understanding (see Remarks to § 6). The universality in question is concrete within itself and consequently has being for itself, and it is the substance of the self-consciousness, its immanent generic character [Gattung] or immanent idea; it is the concept of the free will as the universal which extends beyond its object, which permeates its determination and is identical with itself in this determination. – The universal which has being in and for itself is in general what is called the rational, and it can be understood only in this speculative way.

§ 25
The subjective, as far as the will in general is concerned, denotes the will’s self-conscious aspect, its individuality [Einzelheit] (see § 7) as distinct from its concept which has being in itself. The subjectivity of the will therefore denotes (α) pure form, the absolute unity of the self-consciousness with itself, in which the self-consciousness, as ‘I’ = ‘I’, is totally inward and abstractly dependent upon itself – i.e. the pure certainty of itself, as distinct from truth; (β) the particularity of the will as arbitrariness and as the contingent content of whatever ends the will may pursue; (γ) one-sided form in general (see § 8), in so far as that which is willed, whatever its content, is still only a content belonging to the self-consciousness, an unaccomplished end.

§ 26
(α) The will, in so far as it has itself as its determination and is thus in conformity with its concept and truly itself, is the totally objective will; (β) but the objective will, inasmuch as it lacks the infinite form of self-consciousness, is the will immersed in its object or condition, whatever the content of the latter may be – it is the will of the child, the ethical will,1 or the will of the slave, the superstitious will, etc.; (γ) finally, objectivity is the one-sided form opposed to the subjective determination of the will, and is thus the immediacy of existence [Dasein] as external existence [Existenz]; the will does not become objective to itself in this sense until its ends are fulfilled.

These logical determinations of subjectivity and objectivity have been listed here in order that we may expressly note in relation to them – since they will often be employed in what follows – that, like other distinctions and antithetical determinations of reflection, they pass over into their opposites on account of their finitude and hence of their dialectical nature. Other such antithetical determinations, however, retain a fixed significance for representational thought [Vorstellung] and for the understanding, because their identity is still only of an inward kind. In the will, on the other hand, such antitheses – which are supposed to be abstract, yet at the same time determinations of the will which can be known only as the concrete – lead by themselves to their own identity and to a confusion of their meanings, a confusion into which the understanding quite unwittingly falls. – Thus the will, as freedom with inward being, is subjectivity itself; subjectivity is accordingly the will’s concept and hence its objectivity; but its subjectivity, as opposed to objectivity, is finitude; yet in this very opposition, the will is not with itself but involved with the object, and its finitude consists just as much in the fact that it is not subjective, etc. – Thus, the significance to be attached in what follows to the subjective or objective aspects of the will should in each case be apparent from the context, which defines their position with reference to the totality.

Addition (H). It is usually believed that the subjective and objective are firmly opposed to one another. But this is not the case; they in fact pass over into one another, for they are not abstract determinations like positive and negative, but already have a more concrete significance. If we first consider the term ‘subjective’, this may denote an end peculiar to a specific subject. In this sense, a very bad work of art which does not fulfil its purpose [Sache] is purely subjective. But the same term may also be applied to the content of the will, and it is then roughly synonymous with ‘arbitrary’: a subjective content is one which belongs only to the subject. Thus bad actions, for example, are merely subjective. – But in addition, we may also describe as subjective that pure empty ‘I’ which has only itself as its object [Gegenstand] and which possesses the power to abstract from any further content. Thus, subjectivity may have a wholly particular [partikulare] significance, or it may mean something eminently justified, since everything which I am to recognize also has the task of becoming mine and gaining its validity in me. Such is the infinite greed of subjectivity, which collects and consumes everything within this simple source of the pure ‘I’. The objective may be understood in no less varied ways. We may understand by it everything which we make our object [uns gegenständlich], whether such objects are actual existences [Existenzen] or are mere thoughts which we set up in opposition to ourselves. But we also comprehend [under objectivity] the immediacy of existence [Dasein] in which the end is to be realized: even if the end is itself wholly particular [partikular] and subjective, we nevertheless call it objective as soon as it makes its appearance. But the objective will is also that in which truth is present. Thus the will of God, the ethical will, is objective. Finally, we may also describe as objective the will which is completely immersed in its object [Objekt], such as the will of the child, which is founded on trust and lacks subjective freedom, and the will of the slave, which does not yet know itself as free and is consequently a will with no will of its own. In this sense, every will whose actions are guided by an alien authority and which has not yet completed its infinite return into itself is objective.

§ 27
The absolute determination or, if one prefers, the absolute drive, of the free spirit (see § 21) is to make its freedom into its object [Gegenstand] – to make it objective both in the sense that it becomes the rational system of the spirit itself, and in the sense that this system becomes immediate actuality (see § 26). This enables the spirit to be for itself, as Idea, what the will is in itself. The abstract concept of the Idea of the will is in general the free will which wills the free will.1

§ 28
The activity of the will consists in cancelling [aufzuheben] the contradiction between subjectivity and objectivity and in translating its ends from their subjective determination into an objective one, while at the same time remaining with itself in this objectivity. Apart from the formal mode of consciousness (see § 8) in which objectivity is present only as immediate actuality, this activity is the essential development of the substantial content of the Idea (see § 21), a development in which the concept determines the Idea, which is itself at first abstract, to [produce] the totality of its system. This totality, as the substantial element, is independent of the opposition between a merely subjective end and its realization, and is the same in both of these forms.

§ 29
Right is any existence [Dasein] in general which is the existence of the free will.1 Right is therefore in general freedom, as Idea.

In the Kantian definition [Bestimmung] of right (see the introduction to Kant’s Theory of Right [Metaphysische Anfangsgründe der Rechtslehre, 1797]), which is also more widely accepted, the essential element [Moment] is ‘the limitation of my freedom or arbitrary will in such a way that it may coexist with the arbitrary will of everyone else in accordance with a universal law’.2 On the one hand, this definition contains only a negative determination – that of limitation; and on the other hand, the positive [element] – the universal law or so-called ‘law of reason’, the consonance of the arbitrary will of one individual with that of the other – amounts simply to the familiar [principle of] formal identity and the law of contradiction. The definition of right in question embodies the view, especially prevalent since Rousseau, according to which the substantial basis and primary factor is supposed to be not the will as rational will which has being in and for itself or the spirit as true spirit, but will and spirit as the particular individual, as the will of the single person [des Einzelnen] in his distinctive arbitrariness.3 Once this principle is accepted, the rational can of course appear only as a limitation on the freedom in question, and not as an immanent rationality, but only as an external and formal universal. This view is devoid of any speculative thought and is refuted by the philosophical concept, and has at the same time produced phenomena [Erscheinungen] in people’s minds and in the actual world whose terrifying nature is matched only by the shallowness of the thoughts on which they are based.4

§ 30
Right is something utterly sacred, for the simple reason that it is the existence [Dasein] of the absolute concept, of self-conscious freedom. – But the formalism of right – and also of duty1 – arises out of the different stages in the development of the concept of freedom. In opposition to the more formal, i.e. more abstract and hence more limited kind of right, that sphere and stage of the spirit in which the spirit has determined and actualized within itself the further moments contained in its Idea possesses a higher right, for it is the more concrete sphere, richer within itself and more truly universal.

Each stage in the development of the Idea of freedom has its distinctive right, because it is the existence of freedom in one of its own determinations. When we speak of the opposition between morality or ethics and right, the right in question is merely the initial and formal right of abstract personality. Morality, ethics, and the interest of the state – each of these is a distinct variety of right, because each of them gives determinate shape and existence to freedom. They can come into collision only in so far as they are all in equal measure rights; if the moral point of view of the spirit were not also a right – i.e. freedom in one of its forms – it could not possibly come into collision with the right of personality or with any other right, because every right embodies the concept of freedom, the highest determination of spirit, in relation to which everything else is without substance. But a collision also contains this further moment: it imposes a limitation whereby one right is subordinated to another; only the right of the world spirit is absolute in an unlimited sense.

§ 31
The method whereby the concept, in science, develops out of itself and is merely an immanent progression and production of its own determinations is likewise assumed to be familiar from logic. Its progress does not depend on the assertion that various circumstances are present or on the subsequent application of the universal to such material of extraneous origin.

The moving principle of the concept, which not only dissolves the particularizations of the universal but also produces them, is what I call dialectic. I consequently do not mean that kind of dialectic which takes an object [Gegenstand], proposition, etc. given to feeling or to the immediate consciousness in general, and dissolves it, confuses it, develops it this way and that, and is solely concerned with deducing its opposite – a negative mode which frequently appears even in Plato.1 Such dialectic may regard as its final result the opposite of a given idea [Vorstellung], or, as in the uncompromising manner of ancient scepticism, its contradiction, or, in a lame fashion, an approximation to the truth, which is a modern half-measure.2 The higher dialectic of the concept consists not merely in producing and apprehending the determination as an opposite and limiting factor, but in producing and apprehending the positive content and result which it contains; and it is this alone which makes it a development and immanent progression. This dialectic, then, is not an external activity of subjective thought, but the very soul of the content which puts forth its branches and fruit organically. This development of the Idea as the activity of its own rationality is something which thought, since it is subjective, merely observes, without for its part adding anything extra to it. To consider something rationally means not to bring reason to bear on the object from outside in order to work upon it, for the object is itself rational for itself; it is the spirit in its freedom, the highest apex of self-conscious reason, which here gives itself actuality and engenders itself as an existing world; and the sole business of science is to make conscious this work which is accomplished by the reason of the thing [Sache] itself.

§ 32
The determinations in the development of the concept are on the one hand themselves concepts, but on the other hand, since the concept is essentially Idea, they have the form of existence [Dasein], and the series of concepts which results is therefore at the same time a series of shapes; this is how science should regard them.

In the more speculative sense, the mode of existence of a concept and its determinacy are one and the same thing. But it should be noted that the moments, whose result is a further-determined form [of the concept], precede it as determinations of the concept in the scientific development of the Idea, but do not come before it as shapes in its temporal development. Thus the Idea, in its determination as the family, presupposes those determinations of the concept from which, in a later section of this work, it [i.e. the Idea] will be shown to result. But the other side of this development is that these inner presuppositions should also be present for themselves as shapes, such as the right of property, contract, morality, etc., and it is only at a more advanced stage of culture [Bildung] that the moments of development attain this distinctive shape of existence.

Addition (H). The Idea must continually determine itself further within itself, for it is initially no more than an abstract concept. But this initial abstract concept is never abandoned. On the contrary, it merely becomes continually richer in itself, so that the last determination is also the richest. Those determinations which previously existed only in themselves thereby attain their free self-sufficiency, but in such a way that the concept remains the soul which holds everything together and which arrives at its own differentiation only through an immanent process. One cannot therefore say that the concept arrives at anything new; on the contrary, the last determination coincides in unity with the first. Thus, even if the concept appears to have become fragmented in its existence, this is merely a semblance, as is subsequently confirmed when all its details finally return in the concept of the universal. In the empirical sciences, it is customary to analyse what is found in representational thought [Vorstellung], and when the individual instance has been reduced to the common quality, this common quality is then called the concept. This is not how we proceed, for we merely wish to observe how the concept determines itself, and we force ourselves not to add anything of our own thoughts and opinions. What we obtain in this way, however, is a series of thoughts and another series of existent shapes, in which it may happen that the temporal sequence of their actual appearance is to some extent different from the conceptual sequence. Thus, we cannot say, for example, that property existed before the family, although property is nevertheless dealt with first. One might accordingly ask at this point why we do not begin with the highest instance, that is, with the concretely true. The answer will be that we wish to see the truth precisely in the form of a result, and it is essential for this purpose that we should first comprehend the abstract concept itself. What is actual, the shape which the concept assumes, is therefore from our point of view only the subsequent and further stage, even if it should itself come first in actuality. The course we follow is that whereby the abstract forms reveal themselves not as existing for themselves, but as untrue.

SUBDIVISIONS
§ 33
In accordance with the stages in the development of the Idea of the will which is free in and for itself, the will is

A.    immediate; its concept is therefore abstract, as that of personality, and its existence [Dasein] is an immediate external thing [Sache]; – the sphere of abstract or formal right;

B.    reflected from its external existence into itself, determined as subjective individuality [Einzelheit] in opposition to the universal – the universal partly as something internal, the good, and partly as something external, an existent world, with these two aspects of the Idea mediated only through each other; the Idea in its division or particular existence [Existenz], the right of the subjective will in relation to the right of the world and to the right of the Idea – which, however, has being only in itself; – the sphere of morality;

C.    the unity and truth of these two abstract moments – the thought Idea of the good realized in the internally reflected will and in the external world; – so that freedom, as the substance, exists no less as actuality and necessity than as subjective will; – the Idea in its universal existence [Existenz] in and for itself; [the sphere of] ethical life.

But the ethical substance is likewise

(a)    natural spirit; – the family,

(b)    in its division and appearance; – civil society,

(c)    the state as freedom, which is equally universal and objective in the free self-sufficiency of the particular will; this actual and organic spirit (α) of a people (β) actualizes and reveals itself through the relationship between the particular national spirits (γ) and in world history as the universal world spirit whose right is supreme.

That a thing [Sache] or content which is posited only in accordance with its concept or as it is in itself, has the shape of immediacy or of being, is presupposed from speculative logic; the concept which exists for itself in the form of the concept is something different, and is no longer immediate. – The principle which determines the above subdivisions is likewise presupposed.1 The subdivisions may also be regarded as a historical preview of the parts [of the book], for the various stages must generate themselves from the nature of the content itself as moments in the development of the Idea. Philosophical subdivisions are certainly not an external classification – i.e. an outward classification of a given material based on one or more extraneous principles of organization – but the immanent differentiation of the concept itself. – Morality and ethics, which are usually regarded as roughly synonymous, are taken here in essentially distinct senses.2 Yet even representational thought [Vorstellung] seems to distinguish them; Kantian usage prefers the expression morality, as indeed the practical principles of Kant’s philosophy are confined throughout to this concept, even rendering the point of view of ethics impossible and in fact expressly infringing and destroying it. But even if morality and ethics were etymologically synonymous, this would not prevent them, since they are now different words, from being used for different concepts.

Addition (H). When we speak here of right, we mean not merely civil right, which is what is usually understood by this term, but also morality, ethics, and world history. These likewise belong here, because the concept brings thoughts together in their true relationship. If it is not to remain abstract, the free will must first give itself an existence [Dasein], and the primary sensuous constituents of this existence are things [Sachen], i.e. external objects [Dinge]. This first mode of freedom is the one which we should know as property, the sphere of formal and abstract right; property in its mediated shape as contract, and right in its infringement as crime and punishment, are no less a part of this sphere. The freedom which we have here is what we call the person, that is, the subject which is free, and indeed free for itself, and which gives itself an existence [Dasein] in the realm of things [Sachen]. But this mere immediacy of existence is not in keeping with freedom, and the negation of this determination is the sphere of morality. I am then free no longer merely in this immediate thing [Sache], but also in a superseded immediacy – that is, I am free in myself, in the subjective realm. In this sphere, everything depends on my insight, my intention, and the end I pursue, because externality is now regarded as indifferent. But the good, which is here the universal end, should not simply remain with me; on the contrary, it should be realized. For the subjective will demands that what is internal to it – that is, its end – should attain an external existence [Dasein], and hence that the good should be accomplished in external existence [Existenz]. Morality and the earlier moment of formal right are both abstractions whose truth is attained only in ethical life. Thus, ethical life is the unity of the will in its concept and the will of the individual [des Einzelnen], that is, of the subject. Its initial existence [Dasein] is again something natural, in the form of love and feeling [Empfindung] – the family; here, the individual [das Individuum] has overcome [aufgehoben] his personal aloofness and finds himself and his consciousness within a whole. But at the next stage, we witness the disappearance of ethical life in its proper sense and of substantial unity: the family becomes fragmented and its members behave towards each other as self-sufficient individuals, for they are held together only by the bond of mutual need. This stage of civil society has often been equated with the state. But the state emerges only at the third stage, that of ethical life and spirit, at which the momentous unification of self-sufficient individuality with universal substantiality takes place. The right of the state is therefore superior to the other stages: it is freedom in its most concrete shape, which is subordinate only to the supreme absolute truth of the world spirit.

aTranslator’s note: ‘They are tolerated, like the brothels.’

aTranslator’s note: ‘In civil law all definitions are hazardous.’

aTranslator’s note: ‘You know very well that the advantages and remedies afforded by the laws change and vary in accordance with the customs of the age and types of constitution, with considerations of present advantage and of deficiencies to be remedied, and that they do not persist in a constant state. On the contrary, they are changed by the storms of chance and circumstance, just as storms change the face of the sea and sky. What could be more salutary than the legal proposal of Stolo8 . . ., what more useful than the popular decree of Voconius,9 . . ., and what has been deemed as necessary . . . as the Licinian law . . . ? And yet they have all been obliterated and obscured by the opulence of the present state10 . . .’

aTranslator’s note: The text in the Suhrkamp edition of Hegel’s Werke VII reads Rechtsanteil (‘legal share’). This is clearly an error for Rechtsnachteil, the correct reading as in Ilting’s edition (VPR II, 102).

aTranslator’s note: Hegel uses here the Latin adverb callide.

bTranslator’s note: Hegel uses the Latin and Greek terms fictio and ύπόϱdισις.

cTranslator’s note: Hegel uses the Latin terms filia and filius.

aTranslator’s note: The distinction between the adjective formal and the preceding formell appears to carry no particular significance. On subsequent occasions in the Rechtsphilosophie (for example, § 123 and Hegel’s Remarks to §§ 13, 15, 115, 135, 139, 261, etc.), Hegel uses only formell.

aTranslator’s note: Literally, ‘to close something’.

bTranslator’s note: Literally, ‘to unclose oneself’.

aTranslator’s note: As T. M. Knox (Knox, p. 230, note) surmises, the der of the original must surely read dem. Gans, who compiled the ‘Additions’, has simply taken this error over from Hotho’s transcription of Hegel’s lectures (cf. VPR III, 131).
