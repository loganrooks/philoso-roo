§ 248
In this externality, the determinations of the Notion have the
show of an indifferent subsistence and isolation (Vereinzelung) in
regard to each other, and the Notion, therefore, is present only as
something inward. Consequently, Nature exhibits no freedom in
its existence, but only necessity and contingency.
INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE 17
Remark
For this reason, Nature in the determinate existence which makes
it Nature, is not to be deified; nor are sun, moon, animals, plants,
etc., to be regarded and cited as more excellent, as works of God,
than human actions and events. In itself, in the Idea, Nature is
divine: but as it is, the being of Nature does not accord with its
Notion; rather is Nature the unresolved contradiction. Its characteristic
is positedness, the negative, in the same way that the ancients
grasped matter in general as the non-ens. Thus Nature has
also been spoken of as the self-degradation o f the Idea, in that the
Idea, in this form of externality, is in a disparity with its own self.
It is only to the external and immediate stage of consciousness,
that is, to sensuous consciousness, that Nature appears as the
First, the immediate, as mere being {das Seiende). But because,
even in this element of externality, Nature is a representation of
the Idea, one may, and indeed ought, to admire in it the wisdom of
God. Vanini said that a stalk of straw suffices to demonstrate
God’s being: but every mental image, the slightest fancy of mind,
the play of its most capricious whims, every word, affords a
superior ground for a knowledge of God’s being than any single
object of Nature. In Nature, not only is the play of forms a prey
to boundless and unchecked contingency, but each separate
entity is without the Notion of itself. The highest level to which
Nature attains is life; but this, as only a natural mode of the Idea,
is at the mercy of the unreason of externality, and the living
creature is throughout its whole life entangled with other
alien existences, whereas in every expression of Spirit there
is contained the moment of free, universal self-relation. It is
equally an error to regard the products of mind as inferior to
i8 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE
natural objects, and to regard the latter as superior to human works
o f art, on the ground that these must take their material from
outside, and that they are not alive. As if the spiritual form did
not contain a higher kind of life, and were not more worthy of the
Spirit, than the natural form, and as though form generally were
not superior to matter, and throughout the ethical sphere even
what can be called matter did not belong to Spirit alone: as if in
Nature the higher form, the living creature, did not also receive
its matter from outside. It is put forward as a further superiority of
Nature that throughout all the contingency of its manifold existence
it remains obedient to eternal laws. But surely this is also
true of the realm of self-consciousness, a fact which finds recognition
in the belief that human affairs are governed by Providence;
or are the laws of this Providence in the field of human affairs
supposed to be only contingent and irrational? But if the contingency
of Spirit, the free will (Willkür) does evil, this is still
infinitely superior to the regular motions of the celestial bodies,
or to the innocence of plant life; for what thus errs is still Spirit.
Zusatz. The infinite divisibility of matter simply means that matter is
external to itself. The imm^surableness of Nature, which at first excites
our wonder, is precisely this same externality. Because each material
point seems to be entirely independent of all the others, a failure to hold
fast to the Notion prevails in Nature which is unable to bring together its
determinations. The sun, planets, comets, the Elements, plants, animals,
exist separately by themselves. The sun is an individual other than the
earth, connected with the planets only by gravity. It is only in Hfe that
we meet with subjectivity and the counter to externality. The heart,
liver, eye, are not self-subsistent individualities on their own account,
and the hand, when separated from the body, putrefies. The organic
body is still a whole composed of many members external to each other;
but each individual member exists only in the subject, and the Notion
exists as the power over these members. Thus it is that the Notion, which
at the stage of Notionlessness (Begrifflosigkeit) is only something inward,
first comes into existence in Hfe, as souL The spatiality of the organism
has no truth whatever for the soul; otherwise there would be as m a n y souls
as material points, for the soul feels in each point of the organism. One
must not be deceived by the show of mutual externality, but must
comprehend that mutually external points form only one unity. The celestial
bodies only appear to be independent of each other, they are the
guardians of one field. But because the unity in Nature is a relation between
things which are apparently self-subsistent, Nature is not free, but
is only necessary and contingent. For necessity is the inseparability of
different terms which yet appear as indifferent towards each other; but
because this abstract state of externality also receives its due, there is
contingency in Nature, i.e. external necessity, not the inner necessity of
the Notion. There has been a lot of talk in physics about polarity. This
concept is a great advance in the metaphysics of the science; for the concept
of polarity is simply nothing else but the specific relation of necessity
between two different terms which are one, in that when one is given,
the other is also given. But this polarity is restricted to the opposition.
However, through the opposition there is also given the return of the
opposition into unity, and this is the third term which the necessity of
the Notion has over and above polarity. In Nature, as the otherness [of
the Idea], there also occur the square or the tetrad, for example, the four
Elements, the four colours, etc., and even the pentad, e.g. the fingers and
the senses. In Spirit, the fundamental form of necessity is the triad. The
totality of the disjunction of the Notion exists in Nature as a tetrad
because the first term is die universal as such, and the second, or the
difference, appears itself as a duality—in Nature, the Other must exist
explicidy as Other; with the result that the subjective unity of the universal
and the particular is the fourth term which then has a separate existence
in face of the other three terms. Further, as the monad and the
dyad themselves constitute the entire particularity, the totality of the
Notion can go as far as the pentad.
Nature is the negative because it is the negative of the Idea. Jacob
Boehme says that God’s fiist-bom is Lucifer; and this son of Light
centred his imagination on himself and became evil: that is the moment
of difference, of otherness held fast against the Son, who is otherness
within the divine love. The ground and significance of such conceptions
which occur wildly in an oriental style, is to be found in the negative
nature of Nature. The other form of otherness is immediacy, which
consists in the moment of difference existing abstraedy on its own. This
existence, however, is only momentary, not a true existence; the Idea
alone exists eternally, because it is being in and for itself, i.e. being which
has returned into it6elf. Nature is the first in point of time, but the
absolute prius is the Idea; this absolute pritis is the last, the true beginning,
Alpha is Omega. What is unmediated is often held to be superior,
the mediated being thought of as dependent. The Notion, however, has
both aspects: it is mediation through the subladon of mediation, and so
is immediacy. People speak, for example, of an immediate belief in God;
but this is the inferior mode of being, not the higher; the primitive
religions were religions of nature-worship. The affirmative element in
Nature is the manifestation of the Notion in it; the nearest instance of the
power of the Notion is the perishableness of thi9 outer existence; all
natural existences form but a single body in which dwells the soul [the
Notion]. The Notion manifests itself in these giant members, but not
qua Notion; this occurs only in Spirit where the Notion exists as it is.
INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE 19
§249
Nature is to be regarded as a system o f stages, one arising necessarily
from the other and being the proximate truth of the stage
from which it results: but it is not generated naturally out of the
other but only in the inner Idea which constitutes the ground of
Nature. Metamorphosis pertains only to the Notion as such, since
only its alteration is development. But in Nature, the Notion is
partly only something inward, partly existent only as a living
individual: existent metamorphosis, therefore, is limited to this
individual alone.
20 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE
Remark
It has been an inept conception of ancient and also recent Philosophy
of Nature to regard the progression and transition of one
natural form and sphere into a higher as an outwardly-actual
production which, however, to be made clearer, is relegated to the
obscurity of the past. It is precisely externality which is characteristic
of Nature, that is, differences are allowed to fall apart and
to appear as indifferent to each other: the dialectical Notion which
leads forward the stages, is the inner side of them. A thinking
consideration must reject such nebulous, at bottom, sensuous
ideas, as in particular the so-called origination, for example, of
plants and animals from water, and then the origination of the
more highly developed animal organisms from the lower, and
so on.
Zusatz. The consideration of the utility of natural objects contains this
truth, that they are not an absolute end in and for themselves. This
negative aspect, however, is not external to them but is the immanent
moment of their Idea, which effects their perishability and transition into
another existence, but at the same time into a higher Notion. The Notion
timelessly and in a universal manner posits all particularity in existence.
It is a completely empty thought to represent species as developing successively,
one after the other, in time. Chronological difference has no
interest whatever for thought. If it is only a question of enumerating the
series of living species in order to show the mind how they are divided
into classes, either by starting from the poorest and simplest terms, and
rising to the more developed and richer in determinations and content,
or by proceeding in the reverse fashion, this operation will always have a
INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE ai
general interest. It will be a way of arranging thiogs as in the division
of Nature into three kingdoms; this is preferable to jumbling them together,
a procedure which would be somewhat repellent to an intelligence
which had an inkling of the Notion. But it must not be imagined
that such a dry series is made dynamic or philosophical, or more intelligible,
or whatever you like to 9ay, by representing the terms as producing
each other. Animal nature is the truth of vegetable nature, vegetable
of mineral; the earth is the truth of the solar system. In a system, it is
the most abstract term which is the first, and the truth of each sphere is
the last; but this again is only the first of a higher sphere. It is the necessity
of the Idea which causes each sphere to complete itself by passing
into another higher one, and the variety of forms roust be considered as
necessary and determinate. The land animal did not develop naturally
out of the aquatic animal, nor did it fiy into the air on leaving the water,
nor did perhaps the bird again fall back to earth. I f we want to compare
the different stages of Nature, it is quite proper to note that, for example,
a certain animal has one ventricle and another has two; but we must not
then talk of the fact as if we were dealing with parts which had been put
together. Still less must the category of earlier spheres be used to explain
others: for this is a formal error, as when it is said that the plant is a
carbon pole and the animal a nitrogen pole.
The two forms under which the serial progression of Nature is conceived
are evolution and emanation. The way of evolution, which starts
from the imperfect and formless, is as follows: at first there was the liquid
element and aqueous forms of life, and from the water there evolved
plants, polyps, molluscs, and finally fishes; then from the fishes were
evolved the land animals, and finally from the land animals came m a n .
This gradual alteration is called an explanation and understanding; it is
a conception which comes from the Philosophy of Nature, and it still
flourishes. But though this quantitative difference is of all theories the
easiest to understand, it does not really explain anything at all. The way of
emanation is peculiar to the oriental world. It involves a series of degradations
of being, starting from the perfect being, the absolute totality, God.
God has created, and from Him have proceeded splendours, lightnings
and likenesses in such fashion that the first likeness is that which most
resembles God. This first likeness in its turn, is supposed to have generated
another but less perfect one, and so on, so that each created being has
become, in its turn, a creative being, down to the negative being, matter,
the extreme of evil. Emanation thus ends with the absence of all form.
Both ways are one-sided and superficial, and postulate an indeterminate
goal. That which proceeds from the perfect to the imperfect has
this advantage, that then we have before us the type of the complete
organism; and this is the type which picture-thinking must have before
it in order to understand the imperfect organisms. What appear in the
latter as subordinate, for example, organs which have no functions, is
first understood through the more developed organisms which enable
22 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE
one to see the place the organ fills. The perfect, if it is to have the advantage
over the imperfect, must exist not only in picture-thinking but also
in reality.
The basis of the idea of metamorphosis is also a single Idea which
persists in the various genera and even in each particular organ, so that
these genera and organs are only the diverse forms of a single, self-same
type. Similarly, one speaks of the metamorphosis of an insect, in that the
caterpillar, the pupa and the butterfly, are one and the same individual.
In the case of individuals, the development certainly takes place in time,
but it is otherwise with the genua. With the existence of the genus in a
particular form, the other modes of its existence are necessarily postulated.
Water being given, then air, fire, etc., too, are necessarily postulated.
It is important to hold fast to identity; but to hold fast to difference
is no less important, and this gets pushed into the background when a
change is conceived only quantitatively. This makes the mere idea of
metamorphosis inadequate.
Under the same heading, too, comes the idea of the series formed by
things, and especially living things. The desire to know the necessity of
this development leads to the search for a law of the series, a basic determination
which, while positing difference, repeats itself in such difference
and in so doing also produces a fresh difference. But to enlarge a series
merely by the successive addition of elements similarly determined,
and to see only the same relationship between all the members of the
series, is not the way in which the Notion generates its determinations.
It is this very fact of imagining a series of stages and the like, which has
been such a hindrance to any progress in understanding the necessity of
the various forms of Nature. T o seek to arrange in serial form the planets,
the metals or chemical substances in general, plants and animals, and
then to ascertain the law of the series, is a fruitless task, because Nature
does not arrange its forms in such articulate series: the Notion differentiates
things according to their own specific qualitative character, and to
that extent advances by leaps. The old saying, or so-called law, non
datur sallus in natura, is altogether inadequate to the diremption of the
Notion. The continuity of the Notion with itself is of an entirely different
character.
§ 35°
The contradiction of the Idea, arising from the fact that, as Nature,
it is external to itself, is more precisely this: that on the one hand
there is the necessity of its forms which is generated by the Notion,
and their rational determination in the organic totality; while on
the other hand, there is their indifferent contingency and indeterminable
irregularity. In the sphere of Nature contingency and
determination from without has its right, and this contingency
is at its greatest in the realm of concrete individual forms, which
however, as products of Nature, are concrete only in an immediate
manner. The immediately concrete thing is a group of properties,
external to one another and more or less indifferently related to
each other; and for that very reason, the simple subjectivity
which exists for itself is also indifferent and abandons them to
contingent and external determination. This is the impotence of
Nature, that it preserves the determinations of the Notion only
abstractly, and leaves their detailed specification to external
determination.
INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE 23
Remark
The infinite wealth and variety of forms and, what is most irrational,
the contingency which enters into the external arrangement
of natural things, have been extolled as the sublime freedom of
Nature, even as the divinity o f Nature, or at least the divinity
present in it. This confusion of contingency, caprice, and disorder,
with freedom and rationality is characteristic of sensuous
and unphilosophical thinking. This impotence of Nature sets
limits to philosophy and it is quite improper to expect the Notion
to comprehend—or as it is said, construe or deduce—these
contingent products of Nature. It is even imagined that the more
trivial and isolated the object, the easier is the task of deducing
it.* Undoubtedly, traces of determination by the Notion are to
be found even in the most particularized object, although these
traces do not exhaust its nature. Traces of this influence of the
Notion and of this inner coherence of natural objects will often
surprise the investigator, but especially will they seem startling, or
rather incredible, to those who are accustomed to see only contingency
in natural, as in human, history. One must, however,
be careful to avoid taking such trace of the Notion for the total
* It was in this—and other respects too—quite naive sense that Herr Krug
once challenged the Philosophy of Nature to perform the feat of deducing only
his pen. One could perhaps give him hope that his pen would have the glory of
being deduced, if ever philosophy should advance so far and have such a dear
insight into every great theme in heaven and on earth, past and present, that
there was nothing more important to comprehend.
determination of the object, for that is the route to the analogies
previously mentioned.
In the impotence of Nature to adhere strictly to the Notion in
its realization, lies the difficulty and, in many cases, the impossibility
of finding fixed distinctions for classes and orders from an
empirical consideration of Nature. Nature everywhere blurs the
essential limits of species and genera by intermediate and defective
forms, which continually furnish counter examples to every fixed
distinction; this even occurs within a specific genus, that of man,
for example, where monstrous births, on the one hand, must be
considered as belonging to the genus, while on the other hand, they
lack certain essential determinations characteristic of the genus.
In order to be able to consider such forms as defective, imperfect
and deformed, one must presuppose a fixed, invariable type.
This type, however, cannot be furnished by experience, for it is
experience which also presents these so-called monstrosities,
deformities, intermediate products, etc. The fixed type rather
presupposes the self-subsistence and dignity of the determination
stemming from the Notion.
a4 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE
§251
Nature is, in itself, a living Whole. The movement through its
stages is more precisely this: that the Idea posits itself as that which
it is in itself; or what is the same thing, that it returns into itself
out of its immediacy and externality which is death, in order to be,
first a living creature, but further, to sublate this determinateness
also in which it is only Life, and to give itself an existence as
Spirit, which is the truth and the final goal of Nature and the
genuine actuality of the Idea.
Zusatz. The development of the Notion towards its destination, its end
or, if you like, its purpose, is to be grasped as a positing of what it is in
itself, so that these determinations of its content come into existence, are
manifested, but at the same time not as independent and self-subsistent,
but as moments which remain in the unity of the Notion, as ideal, i.e.
posited moments. This positing can therefore be grasped as an utterance
or expression, a coming forth, a setting forth, a coming-out-of-self, in
so fax as the subjectivity of the Notion is lost in the mutual outsideness
of its determinations. But it preserves itself in them, as their unity and
INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE z5
ideality; and this going out of the centre from itself to the periphery is
therefore, looked at from the opposite side, equally a taking up again of
this outer into the inner, an inwardizing or remembering (Erinnern) that
it is it, the Notion, that exists in this externality. Starting therefore from
the externality in which the Notion at first exists, its progress is a movement
into itself, into the centre, i.e. a bringing of immediate and external
existence which is inadequate to itself, to subjective unity, to beingwithin-
self: not in such a way that the Notion withdraws itself from this
externality, leaving it behind like a dead shell, but rather that existence as
such is within self or conforms to the Notion, that the being-wi thin-self
itself exists, which is Life. The Notion strives to burst the shell of outer
existence and to become for itself. Life is the Notion which has attained
to the manifestation of itself, which has explicated, set forth, what it is in
itself; but the Understanding finds this the most difficult of things to
grasp because what it finds easiest to grasp is the most simple of things,
i.e. the abstract and the dead.
c. Division
The Idea as Nature is:
I. in the determination of asundemess or mutual outsidenesa,
of infinite separatedness, the unity of form being outside it;
this unity, as ideal, is only in itself and is consequently a unity
which is only sought. This is matter and its ideal system—
Mechanics;
II. in the determination of particularity, so that reality is posited
with an immanent determinateness of form and with an
existent difference in it. This is a relationship of Reflection
{Reflexionsverhältnis) whose being-within-self is natural
individuality—Physics;
III. in the determination of subjectivity, in which the real differences
of form are also brought back to the ideal unity which
has found itself and is for itself—Organics.
Zusatz. The division is made from the standpoint of the Notion grasped
in its totality, and it indicates the dimuption of the Notion into its
determinations; and since in this diremption the Notion explicates its
determinations and gives them a self-subsistence, though only as moments,
the process is one of self-realization in which the Notion posits
itself as Idea. But the Notion not only sets forth its moments, and not
only articulates itself in its differences, but it also brings these apparently
26 INTRODUCTION TO PHILOSOPHY OF NATURE
self-subsiatent stages back to their ideality and unity, to itself; and only
then, in fact, has it made itself the concrete Notion, the Idea and the
Truth. It seems, therefore, that there are two ways of presenting both
the Division and the scientific exposition: one way would start from the
concrete Notion, and in Nature this is Life, which would be considered
on its own account. It would then be led to consider the externalized
forma of the Notion, the forms being thrown, out by the Notion to exist
separately as spheres of Nature, the Notion being related to them as to
other—consequently more abstract—modes of its existence; this way
would close with the complete extinction of life. The other way is the
reverse of this. It starts with the, at first, only immediate mode of the
Notion’s existence, with its uttermost self-extemality, and it closes with
the true existence of the Notion, with the truth of the whole course of
its exposition. The first way can be compared to the process implied in
the conception of emanation, the second, to the process implied in the
conception of evolution (§ 249, Zusatz). Each of these forms taken
separately is one-sided, but they exist together; the eternal divine process
ia a flowing in two opposite directions which meet and permeate each
other in what is simply and solely one. The First, let it be called by the
loftiest name, is only an immediate, even though we mean by it something
concrete. Matter, for example, negates itself as an untrue existence
and from this negation emerges a higher existence. From one aspect, it is
by an evolution that the earlier stages are cancelled but from another
aspect matter remains in the background and is produced anew by emanation.
Evolution is thus also an involution, in that matter interiorizea
itself to become life. In virtue of the urge of the Idea to become objective
to itself, the self-subsistent becomes a moment: the senses of the animal,
for example, made objective and external, are the Sun and the lunar and
cometary bodies. Even in the sphere of Physics these bodies lose their
independence although they still retain the same form with some modifications;
they are the Elements [air, fire, and water]. The subjective sense
of sight existing outwardly is the Sun, taste is water, and smell is the air.
But as our task here is to posit the determinations of the Notion, we must
not start from the most concrete, the true sphere, but from the most
abstract.
Matter is the form in which the self-extemality of Nature achieves its
first being-within-self, an abstract being-for-self which is exclusive and
therefore a plurality, which has its unity, as what brings the independent
many into a universal being-for-self, at once within and outside itself:
gravity. In the sphere of Mechanics, being-for-self is not yet an individual,
stable unity having the power to subordinate plurality to itself. Heavy
matter does not yet possess the individuality which preserves its determinations;
and since in matter the determinations of the Notion are still
external to each other, its differences are not qualitative but indifferent
or purely quantitative, and matter, merely as mass, has no form. Form
is acquired by individual bodies in Physics, and with this we have at
once gravity revealed for the first time as the mastery of being-for-self
over multiplicity, a being-for-self which is no longer merely a striving but
which has come to rest, although at first only in the mode of appearance
(nur auf erscheinende Weise). Each atom of gold, for example, contains all
the determinations or properties of the whole lump of gold, and matter is
imminently specified and particularized. The second determination is
that here, still, particularity as qualitative determinateness, and being-forself
as the point of individuality, fell together in unity, and therefore body
is finitely determined; individuality is still bound to definite exclusive
specific properties, does not yet exist as totality. If such a body enters
into a process in which it loses such properties, then it ceases to be what
it is; the qualitative determinateness is therefore affirmatively posited,
but not at the same time also negatively. The organic being is totality as
found in Nature, an individuality which is for itself and which internally
develops into its differences: but in such a way that first, these determinations
are not only specific properties but also concrete totalities; secondly,
they remain also qualitatively determined against each other, and, as thus
finite, are posited as ideal moments by Life, which preserves itself in the
process of these members. Thus we have a number of beings-for-self
which, however, are brought back to the being-for-self which is for
itself and which, as its own end (Selbstzweck), subdues the members and
reduces them to means: this i9 the unity of qualitatively determined
being and gravity, which finds itself in Life.
Each 8tage is a specific realm of Nature and all appear to have independent
existence, But the last is the concrete unity of all the preceding ones,
just as, in general, each successive stage embodies the lower stages, but
equally posits these, as its non-organic nature, over against itself. One
stage is the power of the other, and this relation is reciprocal. Here
can be seen the true meaning of pozoers (Potenzen). The non-organic
Elements are powers opposed to what is individual, subjective—the
non-organic destroys the organic. But equally the organism, in its turn,
is the power which subdues its universal powers, air, water; these are
perpetually liberated and also perpetually subdued and assimilated. The
eternal life of Nature consists in this: first, that the Idea displays itself in
each sphere so far as it can within the finitude of that sphere, just as each
drop of water provides an image of the sun, and secondly, that the
Notion, through its dialectic, breaks through the limitation of this sphere,
since it cannot rest content with an inadequate element, and necessarily
passes over into a higher stage.
