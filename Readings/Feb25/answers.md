1. Nature's lack of freedom stems from its character as the self-externalization of the Idea, where the determinations of the Notion have "the show of an indifferent subsistence." This self-degradation is necessary for the Idea's self-development, as Nature must exist as external to itself before it can be overcome in Spirit. The relationship thus shows both the necessity of Nature's unfreedom and its essential role in the larger systematic development of the Idea.

2. Hegel rejects temporal/evolutionary accounts because they mistake logical necessity for temporal succession. His criticism targets attempts to explain higher forms as emerging historically from lower ones, which he sees as confusing conceptual determination with empirical development. This reflects his broader methodological commitment to understanding Nature through conceptual necessity rather than contingent historical development.

3. Nature's impotence manifests in its inability to fully realize conceptual determinations in actual forms. While natural phenomena exhibit rational necessity in their fundamental structure, they also display contingency in their particular manifestations. This contradiction drives Nature's development by showing how no finite natural form can adequately express the Notion, necessitating the movement toward higher forms and ultimately Spirit.

4. The presence of conceptual determination in particular natural objects reflects the rational structure underlying Nature, while the limits of philosophical comprehension acknowledge the irreducible element of contingency. This reflects Hegel's broader view that reality is fundamentally rational while recognizing that this rationality manifests itself through necessary moments of contingency and particularity.

5. Hegel's argument about natural deformities reveals his view that conceptual determination precedes and grounds empirical observation. The need for a fixed type that cannot come from experience shows how conceptual understanding provides the necessary framework for making sense of empirical phenomena. This demonstrates the priority of rational determination over mere empirical observation.

6. The characterization of Nature as a "living Whole" points to its systematic unity, while its movement toward Spirit shows its inherent teleological structure. Life plays a crucial mediating role as the first manifestation of genuine self-relation within Nature, anticipating the fuller self-relation achieved in Spirit. This shows how Nature's development is guided by an immanent teleology toward its truth in Spirit.

7. The progressive loss of independence by natural elements reflects Nature's development from abstract externality toward more concrete forms of unity. This shows how each stage of Nature involves a higher level of conceptual determination, where earlier forms lose their apparent independence as they are incorporated into more complex systematic relationships. This demonstrates the progressive realization of rational unity within Nature.

8. External necessity in Nature differs from mechanical causation by involving a more complex form of relationship between elements. While mechanical causation involves simple external determination, natural necessity involves internal relationships and polarities that point toward higher forms of unity. This distinction is crucial for understanding how Nature can exhibit both necessity and contingency while pointing beyond itself to Spirit.
