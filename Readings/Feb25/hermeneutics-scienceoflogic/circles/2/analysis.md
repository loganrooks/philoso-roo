# Second Hermeneutic Circle: The Nature of Method

## Focus Passage (Lines 84-95)
"Accordingly, what is to be considered as method here is only the movement of the concept itself... The method is therefore to be acknowledged as the universal, internal and external mode, free of restrictions, and as the absolutely infinite force to which no object that may present itself as something external, removed from reason and independent of it, could offer resistance..."

## Interpretive Moves

### 1. Connection to Previous Circle
- Method emerges from the self-determining nature of the absolute idea
- Unity of theoretical and practical now manifests as unity of method and content
- Self-movement of the concept reflects the living nature of truth

### 2. Part-Whole Relations
- Method section mediates between initial unity and final systematic development
- Connects to earlier discussion of dialectic and later transition to nature
- Reveals internal structure of philosophical science

### 3. Key Conceptual Analysis
a) Movement and Concept
- Movement is internal to concept itself
- Not external application but self-development
- Universal activity as self-determination

b) Universal and Particular
- Method as truly universal through concrete determination
- Not formal universality but self-particularizing movement
- Unity of universal and particular in actual cognition

c) Force and Resistance
- Method as "infinite force" of reason
- No external resistance possible
- Complete penetration of thought and reality

### 4. Horizon Fusion
#### Prior Understanding
- Method as external tool or procedure
- Universal as abstract form
- Force as external compulsion

#### New Understanding
- Method as immanent self-movement
- Universal as self-particularizing activity
- Force as internal self-development

### 5. Critical Insights
1. Method cannot be separated from content
2. Self-movement implies living, organic development
3. No gap between thought and being remains
4. Method is both subjective and objective
5. Understanding requires participation in movement

## Methodological Notes
- Focus on internal necessity of development
- Attention to self-reflexive nature of method
- Recognition of unity of form and content

## Impact Assessment
### Concept Network Effects
- Transformation of understanding of philosophical method
- Integration of logic and metaphysics
- Redefinition of objectivity through reason

### Interpretive Implications
1. Method itself must be understood dialectically
2. No external standpoint for criticism possible
3. Science becomes self-developing system
4. Truth emerges through complete self-determination

## Questions for Final Circle
1. How does this understanding of method relate to the transition to nature?
2. What is the relationship between logical and real development?
3. How does self-determination manifest in systematic exposition?

## Emerging Pattern
- Movement from abstract unity through self-determination to concrete totality
- Integration of opposites through internal development
- Progressive revelation of systematic connections
