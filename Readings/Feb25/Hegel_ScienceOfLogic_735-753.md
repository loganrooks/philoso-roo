chapter 3
The absolute idea 12.236
The absolute idea has shown itself to be the identity of the theoretical and
the practical idea, each of which, of itself still one-sided, possesses the idea
only as a sought-for beyond and unattained goal; each is therefore a synthesis
of striving, each possessing aswell as not possessing the idea within it, passing
over from one thought to the other without bringing the two together but
remaining fixed in the contradiction of the two. The absolute idea, as the
rational concept that in its reality only rejoins itself, is by virtue of this
immediacy of its objective identity, on the one hand, a turning back to life;
on the other hand, it has equally sublated this form of its immediacy and
harbors the most extreme opposition within. The concept is not only soul,
but free subjective concept that exists for itself and therefore has personality –
the practical objective concept that is determined in and for itself and
is as person impenetrable, atomic subjectivity – but which is not, just the
same, exclusive singularity; it is rather explicitly universality and cognition,
and in its other has its own objectivity for its subject matter. All the rest
is error, confusion, opinion, striving, arbitrariness, and transitoriness; the
absolute idea alone is being, imperishable life, self-knowing truth, and is all
truth.
It is the sole subject matter and content of philosophy. Since it contains
all determinateness within it, and its essence consists in returning through
its self-determination and particularization back to itself, it has various
shapes, and the business of philosophy is to recognize it in these. Nature
and spirit are in general different modes of exhibiting its existence, art
and religion its different modes of apprehending itself and giving itself
appropriate existence. Philosophy has the same content and the same
purpose as art and religion, but it is the highest mode of apprehending the
absolute idea, because its mode, that of the concept, is the highest. Hence
it seizes those shapes of real and ideal finitude, as well of infinity and
holiness, and comprehends them and itself. The derivation and cognition
of these particular modes are now the further business of the particular
735
736 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
12.237 philosophical sciences. Also the logicality of the absolute idea can be called
a mode of it; but mode signifies a particular kind, a determinateness of
form, whereas the logicality of the idea is the universal mode in which
all particular modes are sublated and enveloped. The logical idea is the
idea itself in its pure essence, the idea which is enclosed in simple identity
within its concept and in reflective shining has as yet to step into a formdeterminateness.
The Logic thus exhibits the self-movement of the absolute
idea only as the original word, a word which is an utterance, but one that
in being externally uttered has immediately vanished again. The idea is,
therefore, only in this self-determination of apprehending itself; it is in pure
thought, where difference is not yet otherness, but is and remains perfectly
transparent to itself. – The logical idea thus has itself, as the infinite form,
for its content – form that constitutes the opposite of content inasmuch as
the latter is the form determination that has withdrawn into itself and has
been so sublated in identity that this concrete identity stands over against
the identity developed as form; the content has the shape of an other and of
something given as against the form that as such stands simply in reference,
and whose determinateness is posited at the same time as reflective shine. –
More exactly, the absolute idea itself has only this for its content, namely
that the form determination is its own completed totality, the pure content.
Now the determinateness of the idea and the entire course traversed by this
determinateness has constituted the subject matter of the science of logic,
and out of this course the absolute idea has come forth for itself; thus to
be for itself, however, has shown itself to amount to this, namely that
determinateness does not have the shape of a content, but that it is simply
as form, and that accordingly the idea is the absolutely universal idea. What
is left to be considered here, therefore, is thus not a content as such, but
the universal character of its form – that is, method.
Method may appear at first to be just the manner in which cognition
proceeds, and this is in fact its nature. But as method this manner of
proceeding is not only a modality of being determined in and for itself; it is a
modality of cognition, and as such is posited as determined by the concept
and as form, since form is the soul of all objectivity and all otherwise
determined content has its truth in form alone. If the content is again
assumed as given to the method and of a nature of its own, then method,
so understood, is just like the logical realm in general a merely external
form. But against this assumption appeal can be made, not only to the
fundamental concept of what constitutes logic, but to the entire logical
course in which all the shapes of a given content and of objects came up for
consideration. This course has shown the transitoriness and the untruth of
The absolute idea 737
all such shapes; also that no given object is capable of being the foundation
to which the absolute form would relate as only an external and accidental
determination; that, on the contrary, it is the absolute form that has proved 12.238
itself to be the absolute foundation and the ultimate truth. For this course
the method has resulted as the absolutely self-knowing concept, as the concept
that has the absolute, both as subjective and objective, as its subject matter,
and consequently as the pure correspondence of the concept and its reality,
a concrete existence that is the concept itself.
Accordingly, what is to be considered as method here is only the movement
of the concept itself. We already know the nature of this movement,
but it now has, first, the added significance that the concept is all, and
that its movement is the universal absolute activity, the self-determining
and self-realizing movement. The method is therefore to be acknowledged
as the universal, internal and external mode, free of restrictions, and as
the absolutely infinite force to which no object that may present itself as
something external, removed from reason and independent of it, could
offer resistance, or be of a particular nature opposite to it, and could not be
penetrated by it. It is therefore soul and substance, and nothing is conceived
and known in its truth unless completely subjugated to the method; it is the
method proper to each and every fact because its activity is the concept.
This is also the truer meaning of its universality; according to the universality
of reflection, it is taken only as the method for all things; but according
to the universality of the idea, it is both the manner of cognition, of the
concept subjectively aware of itself, and the objective manner, or rather the
substantiality of things – that is, of concepts as they first appear as others
to representation and reflection. It is therefore not only the highest force of
reason, or rather its sole and absolute force, but also reason’s highest and
sole impulse to find and recognize itself through itself in all things. – Second,
here we also have the distinction of the method from the concept as such, the
particularization of the method. As the concept was considered for itself,
it appeared in its immediacy; the reflection, or the concept considering it,
fell on the side of our knowledge. The method is this knowledge itself, for
which the concept is not only as subject matter but is as its own subjective
act, the instrument and the means of cognitive activity, distinct from
this activity and yet the activity’s own essentiality. In cognition as enquiry,
the method likewise occupies the position of an instrument, as a means
that stands on the side of the subject, connecting it with the object. The
subject in this syllogism is one extreme, the object is the other, and in
conclusion the subject unites through its method with the object without
however uniting with itself there. The extremes remain diverse, because
738 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
subject, method, and object are not posited as the one identical concept; the
12.239 syllogism is therefore always the formal syllogism; the premise in which
the subject posits the form on its side as its method is an immediate determination
and contains therefore the determinations of the form – as we
have seen, of definition, division, and so forth71 – as matters of fact found
ready-made in the subject. In true cognition, on the contrary, method is
not only an aggregate of certain determinations, but the determinateness
in-and-for-itself of the concept, and the concept is the middle term only
because it equally has the significance of the objective; in the conclusion,
therefore, the objective does not attain only an external determinateness by
virtue of the method, but is posited rather in its identity with the subjective
concept.
1. Accordingly, what constitutes the method are the determinations of
the concept itself and their connections, and these we must now examine
in the significance that they have as determinations of the method. – In
this, we must begin from the beginning. We spoke of this beginning at
the very beginning of the Logic,72 and also in connection with subjective
cognition,73 and we showed that, when not performed arbitrarily and in
the absence of categorial sensitivity, though it may seem to present many
difficulties, it is nevertheless of an extremely simple nature. Because it is the
beginning, its content is an immediate, but one that has the meaning and
the form of abstract universality. Or be it a content of being, or of essence or
of the concept, inasmuch as it is something immediate, it is assumed, found in
advance, assertoric. But first of all it is not an immediate of sense-intuition or
of representation, but of thought, which because of its immediacy can also be
called a supersensuous, inner intuiting. The immediate of sense-intuition
is a manifold and a singular. Cognition, on the contrary, is a thinking that
conceptualizes; its beginning, therefore, is also only in the element of thought,
a simple and a universal. –We spoke of this form earlier, in connection with
definition.74 At the beginning of finite cognition universality is likewise
recognized as an essential determination, but only as thought – and concept
determination in opposition to being. In fact this first universality is an
immediate universality, and for that reason it has equally the significance of
being, for being is precisely this abstract self-reference. Being has no need
of further derivation, as if it came to the abstract element of definition
only because taken from the intuition of the senses or elsewhere, and
in so far as it can be pointed at. This pointing and deriving involve a

73 Cf. above, 12.215. 74 Cf. above, 12.210.
The absolute idea 739
mediation that is more than a mere beginning, and is a mediation of a kind
that does not belong to the comprehension of thought, but is rather the
elevation of representation, of empirical and ratiocinative consciousness, to 12.240
the standpoint of thinking. According to the currently accepted opposition
of thought, or concept, and being, it passes as a very important truth that
no being belongs as yet to thought as thought, and that being has a ground
of its own independent of thought. But the simple determination of being
is in itself so poor that, if for that reason alone, not much fuss ought to be
made about it; the universal is immediately itself this immediate because,
as abstract, it is also the abstract self-reference which is being. In fact, the
demand that being should be exhibited has a further, inner meaning in
which more is at issue than just this abstract determination; implied in it
is the demand for the realization of the concept, a realization that is missing
at the beginning itself but is rather the goal and the business of the entire
subsequent development of cognition. Further, inasmuch as the content
of the beginning is to be justified and authenticated as something true or
correct by being exhibited in inner or outer perception, it is no longer
the form of universality as such that is meant, but its determinateness,
about which more in a moment. The authentication of the determinate
content with which the beginning is made seems to lie behind it, but is in
fact to be regarded as an advance, in so far as it is a matter of conceptual
cognition.
The beginning, therefore, has for the method no other determinateness
than that of being the simple and universal; this is precisely the determinateness
that makes it deficient. Universality is the pure, simple concept, and
the method, as the consciousness of this concept, is aware that universality
is only a moment and that in it the concept is still not determined in and for
itself. But with this consciousness that would want to carry the beginning
further only for the sake of method, the method is only a formal procedure
posited in external reflection. Where the method, however, is the objective
and immanent form, the immediate character of the beginning must be
a lack inherent in the beginning itself, which must be endowed with the
impulse to carry itself further. But in the absolute method the universal
has the value not of a mere abstraction but of the objective universal, that
is, the universal that is in itself the concrete totality, but a totality as yet not
posited, not yet for itself. Even the abstract universal is as such, when considered
conceptually, that is, in its truth, not just anything simple, but is,
as abstract, already posited afflicted by a negation. For this reason also there
is nothing so simple and so abstract, be it in actuality or in thought, as is
commonly imagined. Anything as simple as that is a mere presumption that
740 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
has its ground solely in the lack of awareness of what is actually there. –We
said earlier that the beginning is made with the immediate;75 the immediacy
12.241 of the universal is the same as what is here expressed as the in-itself that is
without being-for-itself. –One may well say, therefore, that every beginning
must be made with the absolute, just as every advance is only the exposition
of it, in so far as implicit in existence is the concept.76 But because the
absolute exists at first only implicitly, in itself, it equally is not the absolute
nor the posited concept, and also not the idea, for the in-itself is only an
abstract, one-sided moment, and this is what they are. The advance is not,
therefore, a kind of superfluity; this is what it would be if that which is
at the beginning were already the absolute; the advance consists rather in
this, that the universal determines itself and is the universal for itself, that
is, equally a singular and a subject. Only in its consummation is it the
absolute.
It may also be mentioned that a beginning which is in itself a concrete
totality may as such also be free and its immediacy have the determination
of an external existence; the germ of anything living, and subjective purpose
in general, have shown themselves to be such beginnings; hence both are
themselves impulses. The non-spiritual and inanimate, on the contrary, are
the concrete concept only as real possibility; cause is the highest stage in
which the concrete concept has, as the beginning in the sphere of necessity,
an immediate existence; but it is not yet a subject that maintains itself
as such in the course of its effective realization. The sun, for instance,
and in general all things inanimate, are determinate concrete existences
in which real possibility remains an inner totality; the moments of the
latter are not posited in them in subjective form and therefore, in so far
as they are realized, they attain concrete existence through other corporeal
individuals.
2. The concrete totality which makes the beginning possesses as such,
within it, the beginning of the advance and development. As concrete,
it is differentiated in itself, but because of its initial immediacy, this first
differentiation is to start with a diversity. However, as self-referring universality,
as subject, the immediate is also the unity of this diversity. – This
reflection is the first stage of the forward movement – the emergence of
non-indifference, judgment, and determining in general. Essential is that the
method find, and recognize, the determination of the universal within it.
Whatever in this abstractive generation of the universal is left out of the
concrete is then picked up, still externally, by the finite cognition of the
75 Cf. above, 12.210. 76 das Ansichseiende ist der Begriff.
The absolute idea 741
understanding. This is how the latter operates. The absolute method, on
the contrary, does not behave in this manner of external reflection but
takes the determinate from its subject matter, for it is itself its immanent
principle and its soul. – This is what Plato demanded of cognition, that it 12.242
should consider things in and for themselves; on the one hand, that it should
consider them in their universality; on the other hand, that it should not
stray away from them while it grasps at circumstances, examples, and comparisons,
but, on the contrary, should keep only them in view before it
and bring to consciousness what is immanent in them. – To this extent the
method of absolute cognition is analytic. That the method finds the further
determinations of its initial universal simply and solely in this universal,
constitutes the concept’s absolute objectivity, of which the method is the
certainty. – Equally so, however, is the method synthetic, for its subject
matter, while immediately determined as the simple universal, through the
determinateness which it has in its very immediacy and universality, proves
to be an other. Yet this connection in diversity that the subject matter is
thus in itself, is no longer a synthesis as understood in finite cognition; the
no less thoroughly analytic determination of the subject matter, the fact
that the connection is within the concept, already distinguishes it fully from
the latter synthesis.
This no less synthetic than analytic moment of the judgment through
which the initial universal determines itself from within itself as the other
of itself is to be called the dialectical moment. Dialectic is one of those
ancient sciences that have been the most misjudged in the metaphysics of
the moderns, and in general also by popular philosophy, both ancient and
recent. Diogenes La¨ertius said of Plato that, just as Thales was the founder
of natural philosophy and Socrates of moral philosophy, so Plato was the
founder of the third of the sciences that belong to philosophy, of dialectic –
a contribution for which he was highly esteemed by the ancients but that
often goes quite unnoticed by those who have the most to say about him.77
Dialectic has often been regarded as an art, as if it rested on a subjective
talent and did not belong to the objectivity of the concept. What shape
it received in Kantian philosophy, and with what result, has already been
indicated in representative examples of that philosophy’s view.78 It must be
regarded as an infinitely important step that dialectic is once more being
77 SeeDiogenes Laertius, Vitae philosophorum, Vol. 1, ed.MiroslavMarcovich (Stuttgart: B.G.Teubner,
1999), Book 3, §56; Lives of Eminent Philosophers, Vol. 1, trans. R. D. Hicks (Cambridge, MA:
Harvard University Press, 1965).
78 i.e. Hegel’s discussion of Kant’s Dialectic of Pure Reason. Cf. above, 12.157–158; 21.180ff.
742 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
recognized as necessary to reason, although the result that must be drawn
from it is the opposite than Kant drew.
When dialectic is not presented, as it generally is, as something incidental,
it usually assumes the following more precise form. It is shown of
a subject matter or other (for instance: world, movement, point, and so
on) that a certain determination accrues to it (for instance, in the order of
the just mentioned examples: finitude in space or time, being at this place,
absolute negation of space), also the opposite determinations can then just
as necessarily be shown to accrue to it (for example: infinity in space and
time, not-being at this place, reference to space and hence spatiality). The
older Eleatic school directed its dialectic especially against motion; Plato
12.243 commonly did it against accepted notions and concepts of his time, in particular
those of the Sophists, but also against the pure categories and the
determinations of reflection; the later and more sophisticated form of skepticism
extended it not only to the immediate so-called facts of consciousness
and the maxims of ordinary life, but also to all scientific concepts. Now the
conclusion drawn from this kind of dialectic is in general the contradiction
and nullity of the asserted claims. But this can happen in two ways – either
in the objective sense, that the subject matter that thus contradicts itself
internally cancels itself and is a non-thing (this was, for instance, the conclusion
of the Eleatics, who denied the truth of the world, of movement,
of the point); or in the subjective sense, that cognition is deficient. Now
understood in this last subjective sense, the conclusion may be taken in
two further ways. It may mean that it is this dialectic itself that generates
the artifice of an illusion. This is the common view of the so-called healthy
common sense that takes its stand on the evidence of the senses and on customary
notions and claims, at times quietly, likeDiogenes the cynic did, who
demonstrated the vacuity of the dialectic of motion by silently walking up
and down; but often by getting itself all worked up, declaring that dialectic
is mere foolery or, when important ethical matters are at issue, the criminal
attempt at unsettling essentially solid norms and providing excuses for the
wicked – a view we see directed in the Socratic dialectic against that of
the Sophists, with an ire that, turned into the opposite direction, even cost
Socrates his life. As for the vulgar refutation that opposes to thinking, as
Diogenes did, sensuous consciousness and in this latter believes that it finds
the truth, this we must leave to itself; but in so far as dialectic sublates
ethical determinations, we must have confidence in reason that it will
know how to reinstate them, but reinstate them in their truth and in the
consciousness of their right, though also of their limitations. – Yet another
view is that the result of subjective nullity has nothing to do with dialectic
The absolute idea 743
itself, but that it affects the cognition against which it is directed and, in
the view of skepticism and likewise of the Kantian philosophy, cognition in
general.
The fundamental prejudice here is that dialectic has only a negative
result – a point about which more in a moment. First, regarding the said
form in which dialectic usually makes its appearance, it is to be observed
that according to that form the dialectic and its result affect a subject matter
which is previously assumed or also the subjective cognition of it, and
declare either the latter or the subject matter to be null and void, while,
on the contrary, no attention is given to the determinations which are
exhibited in the subject matter as in a third thing and presupposed as valid
for themselves. To have called attention to this uncritical procedure has
been the infinite merit of the Kantian philosophy, and in so doing to have 12.244
given the impetus to the restoration of logic and dialectic understood as the
examination of thought determinations in and for themselves. The subject
matter, as it is apart from thought and conceptualization, is a picture
representation or also a name; it is in the determinations of thought and of
the concept that it is what it is. In fact, therefore, everything rests on these
determinations; they are the true subject matter and content of reason,
and anything else that might be understood by subject matter and content
in distinction from them has meaning only through them and in them.
It must not therefore be taken as the fault of a subject matter or of the
cognition that these determinations, because of what they are and the way
they are externally joined, prove to be dialectical. On this assumption,
the subject matter and the cognition are imagined to be a subject on
which the determinations are brought to bear, in the form of predicates,
properties, or self-subsistent universals, as fixed and independently correct,
so that these determinations are brought into dialectical relations and incur
contradiction only by extraneous and contingent conjunction in and by a
third thing. But this kind of external and fixed subject of imagination and
understanding, and also these abstract determinations, cannot be regarded
as ultimates, as secure and permanent substrates.On the contrary, they are to
be regarded as themselves immediate, precisely the kind of presuppositions
and starting points which, as we have shown above,79 must succumb to
dialectic in and for themselves, because they are to be taken as in themselves
the concept. The same applies to all oppositions that are assumed as fixed,
as for example the finite and the infinite, the singular and the universal.
These are not in contradiction through some external conjoining; on the
79 Cf. above, 12.240–241.
744 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
contrary, as an examination of their nature shows, they are a transition in
and for themselves; the synthesis and the subject in which they appear is
the product of their concept’s own reflection. If a consideration that avoids
the concept stops short at their external relation, isolates them and leaves
them as fixed presuppositions, it is the concept that, on the contrary, will
fix its sight on them, move them as their soul and bring out their dialectic.
Now this is the very standpoint indicated above80 from which a universal
prius, considered in and for itself, proves to be the other of itself. Taken quite
generally, this determination can be taken to mean that what is at first
immediate is therewith posited as mediated, as referred to an other, or
that the universal is posited as a particular. The second universal that has
thereby arisen is thus the negative of that first and, in view of subsequent
developments, the first negative. From this negative side, the immediate has
perished in the other; but the other is essentially not an empty negative, the
12.245 nothing which is normally taken to be the result of dialectic, but is rather
the other of the first, the negative of the immediate; it is therefore determined
as the mediated – contains as such the determination of the first in it. The
first is thus essentially preserved and contained also in the other. – To hold
fast to the positive in its negative, to the content of the presupposition in
the result, this is the most important factor in rational cognition; what
is more, it takes only the simplest of reflections to be convinced of the
absolute truth and necessity of this requirement, and as for examples of
proofs that testify to this, the whole Logic consists of such proofs.
So what we now have, taken first or also immediately, is the mediated,
also a simple determination, for the first has perished in it, and only the
second is therefore at hand. Now since the first is contained in the second,
and this second is the truth of the first, this unity of the two can be expressed
in the form of a proposition in which the immediate is placed as the subject
but the mediated as its predicate; for example, “the finite is infinite,” “one
is many,” “the singular is the universal.” The inadequacy of the form
of such propositions and judgments is however obvious. In connection
with judgment it was shown that its form in general, and most of all the
immediate form of the positive judgment, is incapable of holding within its
grasp the speculative content and the truth.81 Its closest complement, the
negative judgment, would have to be brought in at least in equal measure.
In judgment the first, as subject, conveys the reflective semblance of an
independent subsistence, whereas it is in fact sublated in the predicate as
in its other; this negation is indeed contained in the content of the above
80 Cf. above, 12.242. 81 Cf. above, 12.64.
The absolute idea 745
propositions, but their positive form contradicts the content; consequently,
what is contained in them is not posited – whereas this was precisely the
intent behind the use of a proposition.
The second determination, the negative or mediated determination, is
moreover at the same time the one that mediates. At first it may be taken as
a simple determination, but its truth is that it is a reference or relation; for
it is the negative, but the negative of the positive, and it includes this positive
within itself. It is the other, therefore, not of a one to which it is indifferent;
in that case it would not be an other, nor a reference or relation. It is rather
the other in itself, the other of an other; hence it includes its own other within
itself and is consequently the contradiction, the posited dialectic, of itself. –
Because the first or the immediate is the concept in itself or implicitly,
and therefore is the negative also only implicitly, the dialectical moment
in it consists in the positing of the difference that is implicitly contained
in it. The second is on the contrary itself the determinate, the difference or 12.246
relation; hence the dialectical moment consists in its case in the positing
of the unity contained within it. – For this reason, if the negative, the
determinate, relation, judgment, and all the determinations falling under
this second moment, do not appear by themselves already as contradiction,
as dialectical, this is solely a defect on the part of thinking that fails to bring
its thoughts together. For the material, the opposed determinations in one
connection, are already posited, already present for thought. But formal
thinking makes identity its law, lets the contradictory content that it has
before it fall into the sphere of representation, in space and time, where
the contradictory is held in external moments, next to and following each
other, parading before consciousness without reciprocal contact. The firm
principle that formal thinking lays down for itself here is that contradiction
cannot be thought. But in fact the thought of contradiction is the essential
moment of the concept. Formal thought does in fact think it, only it at
once looks away from it and stating its principle it only passes over from it
into abstract negation.
Now the negativity just considered constitutes the turning point of the
movement of the concept. It is the simple point of the negative self-reference,
the innermost source of all activity, of living and spiritual self-movement;
it is the dialectical soul which everything true possesses and through which
alone it is true; for on this subjectivity alone rests the sublation of the
opposition between concept and reality, and the unity which is truth. –
The second negative at which we have arrived, the negative of the negative,
is this sublating of contradiction, and it too, just like contradiction, is
not an act of external reflection; for it is on the contrary the innermost,
746 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
objective moment of the life of spirit by virtue of which a subject is a person,
is free. – The self-reference of the negative is to be regarded as the second
premise of the entire syllogism. If the terms analytic and synthetic are used
as opposites, the first premise may be regarded as the analytic moment, for
in it the immediate relates to its other immediately and therefore passes
over, or rather has passed over, into it – though this connection, as already
remarked, is for this very reason also synthetic, for it is its other that it passes
over into. The second premise considered here may be defined as synthetic,
because it is the connection of the differentiated, as differentiated, to that
from which it is differentiated. – Just as the first premise is the moment of
universality and communication, so is the second determined by singularity –
a singularity which in referring to the other is at first exclusive, for itself,
12.247 and different. The negative appears as the mediating factor, because it holds
itself and the immediate of which it is the negation within itself. In so far
as these two determinations are taken as referring to each other externally
in some relation or other, the negative is only the formal mediating factor;
but, as absolute negativity, the negative moment of absolute mediation is
the unity which is subjectivity and soul.
In this turning point of the method, the course of cognition returns at the
same time back into itself. This negativity is as self-sublating contradiction
the restoration of the first immediacy, of simple universality; for the other
of the other, the negative of the negative, is immediately the positive, the
identical, the universal. In the whole course, if one at all cares to count, this
second immediate is third to the first immediate and the mediated. But it
is also third to the first or formal negative and to the absolute negativity or
second negative; now in so far as that first negative is already the second
term, the term counted as third can also be counted as fourth, and instead
of a triplicity, the abstract form may also be taken to be a quadruplicity; in
this way the negative or the difference is counted as a duality. – The third or
the fourth is in general the unity of the first and the second moment, of the
immediate and the mediated. – That it is this unity, or that the entire form
of the method is a triplicity, is indeed nothing but the merely superficial,
external side of cognition; but to have also demonstrated this superficiality,
and to have done it in the context of a specific application (for the abstract
form of number has been around for a long time, as is well known, but
without conceptual comprehension and therefore without any result) is
again to be regarded as an infinite merit of the Kantian philosophy.82 The
syllogism, or the threefold, has always been recognized to be the universal
82 B110.
The absolute idea 747
form of reason; but it has had in general the value of a wholly external form
that does not determine the nature of the content; moreover, since in its
formalism it gets caught up in the understanding’s determination of mere
identity, it lacks the essential dialectical moment of negativity; and yet this
moment enters into the triplicity of the determinations, because the third
term is the unity of the two first determinations and these, since they are
diverse, can be in unity only as sublated. – Formalism, it is true, has also
seized hold of triplicity, attending to its empty schema; the shallow nonsense
and the barrenness of the so-called construction of modern philosophy, that
consists in nothing but fastening that formal schema everywhere for the
sake of external order, with no concept or immanent determination, has 12.248
rendered that form tedious and has given it a bad name. Yet the insipidity
of this use cannot rob it of its inner worth, and the fact that the shape of
reason was discovered, albeit without conceptual comprehension at first, is
always to be highly valued.
Now, on closer examination, the third is the immediate, but the immediate
through sublation of mediation, the simple through the sublating of
difference, the positive through the sublating of the negative; it is the
concept that has realized itself through its otherness, and through the sublating
of this reality has rejoined itself and has restored its absolute reality,
its simple self-reference. This result is therefore the truth. It is just as much
immediacy as mediation – though these forms of judgments, that the third
is immediacy and mediation, or that it is the unity of the two, are not
capable of grasping it, for it is not a dormant third but, exactly like this
unity, self-mediating movement and activity. – Just as that with which we
began was the universal, so the result is the singular, the concrete, the subject;
what the former is in itself, the latter is now equally for itself: the universal
is posited in the subject. The two first moments of triplicity are abstract,
untrue moments that are dialectical for that very reason, and through this
their negativity make themselves into the subject. For us at first, the concept
itself is both the universal that exists in itself and the negative that
exists for itself, and also the third term that exists in and for itself, the
universal that runs through all the moments of the syllogism; but this third
is the conclusion in which the concept mediates itself with itself through
its negativity and is thereby posited for itself as the universal and the identity
of its moments.
Now this result, as the whole that has withdrawn into itself and is identical
with itself, has given itself again the form of immediacy. Consequently,
it is now itself all that the starting point had determined itself to be. As simple
self-reference it is a universal, and in this universal the negativity that
748 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
constituted its dialectic and mediation has likewise withdrawn into simple
determinateness, which can again be a beginning. It may seem at first that
this cognition of the result is an analysis of it and would therefore have to
dissect these determinations again, and the course that it went through in
order to come to be – the course that we have examined. But if the subject
matter were in fact treated analytically in this manner, it would belong to
that stage of the idea considered above,83 a mode of cognition that searches
for its subject matter and only states of it what it is, without the necessity
of its concrete identity and of its concept. But the method of truth that
comprehends the subject matter, though analytic as we have seen, since
it remains strictly within the concept, is however equally synthetic, for
12.249 through the concept the subject matter is determined as dialectical and as
other.84 On the new foundation that the result has now constituted as the
subject matter, the method remains the same as in the preceding subject
matter. The difference concerns solely the status of the foundation as such;
although it is certainly still a foundation, its immediacy is only form, since
it was a result as well; hence its determinateness as content is no longer
something merely taken up but is deduced and proved.
It is here that the content of cognition first enters as such into the circle
of consideration, because as deduced it now belongs to the method. The
method itself expands with this moment into a system. – With respect to
content, the beginning has to be for the method at first wholly indeterminate;
to this extent the method appears as the merely formal soul, for
which and by which the beginning was determined simply and solely only
according to form, that is to say, as the immediate and universal. In the
course of the movement we have indicated, the subject matter has received
a determinateness for itself – and this determinateness is a content, for the
negativity that has withdrawn into simplicity is the sublated form, and
stands as simple determinateness over against its development, and in the
first instance against its very opposition to universality.
Now since this determinateness is the proximate truth of the indeterminate
beginning, it denounces the incompleteness of the latter, and it also
denounces the method itself which, starting from that beginning, was only
formal. This can now be expressed as the henceforth determinate demand
that the beginning, since as against the determinateness of the result it
is itself something determinate, ought to be taken not as immediate, but
as mediated and deduced. This may appear as the demand for an infinite
retrogression in proof and deduction; just as from the newly obtained
83 Cf. above, 12.209. 84 Cf. above, 12.242.
The absolute idea 749
beginning a result likewise emerges as the method runs its course, so that
the movement would roll on forwards to infinity as well.
It has been repeatedly shown that the infinite progression as such belongs
to a reflection void of concept; the absolute method, which has the concept
for its soul and content, cannot lead into it. Even such beginnings as
being, essence, universality, may seem at first to be of the kind that possess
the full universality and complete absence of content that is required for
an entirely formal beginning, such as the beginning is supposed to be,
and therefore not to require or allow, as absolutely first beginnings, further
regress. Since they refer purely to themselves, they are immediate and
indeterminate, and so they do not of course have in them the difference
which is straightaway posited in some other beginning between the universality
of its form and its content. But the very indeterminacy which
these logical beginnings have as their sole content is what constitutes their 12.250
determinateness; this determinateness consists in their negativity, as sublated
mediation; the particularity of this negativity gives a particularity
also to their indeterminacy, and it is by virtue of it that being, essence, and
universality, are differentiated. Now the determinateness that accrues to
them when taken for themselves is their immediate determinateness, and
this is just as immediate as that of any content and in need, therefore,
of derivation; for the method it is a matter of indifference whether the
determinateness is taken as determinateness of form or of content. That it
gives itself a determination by the first of its results does not mean that,
in fact, it is thereby set on a new footing; it remains neither more nor less
formal than before. For since the method is the absolute form, the concept
that knows itself and everything as concept, there is no content that
would stand out over against it and determine it as a one-sided external
form. Hence, just as the lack of content of the said beginnings does not
make them absolute beginnings, so too it is not the content that would
as such lead the method into the infinite progress forwards or backwards.
In one respect, the determinateness that the method generates for itself in
its result is the moment through which it is self-mediation and converts
the immediate into a mediated beginning. But conversely, it is through that
determinateness that this mediation of the method runs its course; it goes
through a content, as through a seeming other of itself, back to its beginning,
in such a way that it does not merely restore that beginning, albeit as
determinate, but that the result is equally the sublated determinateness, and
hence also the restoration of the first immediacy in which it began. This
it accomplishes as a system of totality. We now have to consider it in this
determination.
750 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
The determinateness which was the result is, as we have shown,85 itself
a new beginning because of the form of simplicity into which it has
withdrawn; since this beginning is distinguished from the one preceding
it by this very determinateness, cognition rolls onwards from content to
content. First of all, this forward movement determines itself in that it
begins from simple determinacies, and the following become ever richer
and more concrete. For the result contains its beginning and its course
has enriched it with a new determinateness. The universal constitutes the
foundation; the advance is not to be taken, therefore, as a flowing from
other to other. In the absolute method, the concept maintains itself in its
otherness, the universal in its particularization, in judgment and reality; at
each stage of further determination, the universal elevates the whole mass of
its preceding content, not only not losing anything through its dialectical
advance, or leaving it behind, but, on the contrary, carrying with itself all
12.251 that it has gained, inwardly enriched and compressed.
This expansion may be regarded as the moment of content, and in the
whole as the first premise; the universal is communicated to the wealth of
content, is immediately received in it. But the relation has also a second,
negative or dialectical side. The enrichment proceeds in the necessity of the
concept, it is contained by it, and every determination is a reflection into
itself. Each new stage of exteriorization, that is, of further determination, is
also a withdrawing into itself, and the greater the extension, just as dense
is the intensity. The richest is therefore the most concrete and the most
subjective, and that which retreats to the simplest depth is the mightiest
and the most all-encompassing. The highest and most intense point is the
pure personality that, solely by virtue of the absolute dialectic which is its
nature, equally embraces and holds everything within itself, for it makes
itself into the supremely free – the simplicity which is the first immediacy
and universality.
It is in this manner that each step of the advance in the process of further
determination, while getting away from the indeterminate beginning, is
also a getting back closer to it; consequently, that what may at first appear
to be different, the retrogressive grounding of the beginning and the progressive
further determination of it, run into one another and are the same.
The method, which thus coils in a circle, cannot however anticipate in
a temporal development that the beginning is as such already something
derived; sufficient for an immediate beginning is that it be simple universality.
Inasmuch as this is what it is, it has its complete condition; and
85 Cf. above, 12.248, 249.
The absolute idea 751
there is no need to deprecate the fact that it may be accepted only provisionally
and hypothetically. Whatever might be adduced against it – about
the limitations of human cognition; about the need to reflect critically
on the instrument of cognition before getting to the fact itself – all these
are themselves presuppositions, concrete determinations that as such carry
with them the demand for mediation and grounding. Therefore, since
they formally have no advantage over beginning with the fact itself as they
protest against, and, because of their more concrete content, are on the
contrary all the more in need of derivation, singling them out for special
attention is to be considered as empty presumption. They have an untrue
content, for they make into something incontestable and absolute what is
known to be finite and untrue, namely a restricted cognition determined as
form and instrument in opposition to its content; this untrue cognition is itself
also the form, the retroactive search for grounds. – The method of truth also
knows that the beginning is incomplete, because it is a beginning; but at
the same time it knows that this incompleteness is necessary, because truth
is but the coming-to-oneself through the negativity of immediacy. The
impatience that would merely transcend the determinate – be it called begin- 12.252
ning, object, the finite, or in whatever other form it is otherwise taken –
in order that one would find oneself immediately in the absolute, has
nothing before it as cognition but the empty negative, the abstract infinite.
Or what it has before it is a presumed absolute, presumed because not
posited, not comprehended; comprehended it will be only through the mediation
of cognition, of which the universal and immediate are a moment,
and as for the truth itself, it resides only in the extended course of mediation
and at the end. – To meet the subjective need and the impatience that
come with not knowing, one may well provide an overview of the whole in
advance – by means of a division for reflection that, in the manner of finite
cognition, gives the particular of the universal as already there, to be waited
for as the science progresses. Yet this affords nothing more than a picture
for representation; for the true transition from the universal to the particular
and to the whole which is determined in and for itself and in which that
first universal is in truth itself again a moment – this transition is alien to
the division of reflection and is the exclusive mediation of science itself.
By virtue of the nature of the method just indicated, the science presents
itself as a circle that winds around itself, where the mediation winds the
end back to the beginning which is the simple ground; the circle is thus a
circle of circles, for each single member ensouled by the method is reflected
into itself so that, in returning to the beginning it is at the same time the
beginning of a new member. Fragments of this chain are the single sciences,
752 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
each of which has a before and an after – or, more accurately said, has in
possession only the before and in its conclusion points to its after.
So the logic also has returned in the absolute idea to this simple unity
which is its beginning; the pure immediacy of being, in which all determination
appears at first as extinguished or removed by abstraction, is the
idea that through mediation, that is, the sublation of mediation, has come
to the likeness corresponding to it. The method is the pure concept that
only relates to itself; it is, therefore, the simple self-reference which is being.
But it now is also the fulfilled concept, the concept that comprehends itself
conceptually, being as the concrete and just as absolutely intensive totality. –
In conclusion, there remains only this to be said of this idea, that in it, in
the first place, the science of logic has apprehended its own concept. In the
sphere of being, at the beginning of its content, its concept appears as a
knowledge external to that content in subjective reflection. But in the idea
of absolute cognition, the concept has become the idea’s own content. The
idea is itself the pure concept that has itself as its subject matter and which,
as it runs itself as subject matter through the totality of its determinations,
12.253 builds itself up to the entirety of its reality, to the system of science, and
concludes by apprehending this conceptual comprehension of itself, hence
by sublating its position as content and subject matter and cognizing the
concept of science. – In second place, this idea is still logical; it is shut
up in pure thought, the science only of the divine concept. Its systematic
exposition is of course itself a realization, but one confined within the same
sphere. Because the pure idea of cognition is to this extent shut up within
subjectivity, it is the impulse to sublate it, and pure truth becomes as final
result also the beginning of another sphere and science. It only remains here
to indicate this transition.
The idea, namely, in positing itself as the absolute unity of the pure
concept and its reality and thus collecting itself in the immediacy of being,
is in this form as totality – nature. – This determination, however, is
nothing that has become, is not a transition, as was the case above when the
subjective concept in its totality becomes objectivity, or the subjective purpose
becomes life.86 The pure idea into which the determinateness or reality of the
concept is itself raised into concept is rather an absolute liberation for which
there is no longer an immediate determination which is not equally posited
and is not concept; in this freedom, therefore, there is no transition that
takes place; the simple being to which the idea determines itself remains
perfectly transparent to it: it is the idea that in its determination remains
86 Cf. above, 12.125–126; 160–181.
The absolute idea 753
with itself. The transition is to be grasped, therefore, in the sense that the
idea freely discharges87 itself, absolutely certain of itself and internally at
rest. On account of this freedom, the form of its determinateness is just as
absolutely free: the externality of space and time absolutely existing for itself
without subjectivity. – Inasmuch as this externality is only in the abstract
determinateness of being and is apprehended by consciousness, it is as mere
objectivity and external life; within the idea, however, it remains in and
for itself the totality of the concept, and science in the relation of divine
cognition to nature. But what is posited by this first resolve of the pure idea
to determine itself as external idea is only the mediation out of which the
concept, as free concrete existence that from externality has come to itself,
raises itself up, completes this self-liberation in the science of spirit, and in
the science of logic finds the highest concept of itself, the pure concept
conceptually comprehending itself.
