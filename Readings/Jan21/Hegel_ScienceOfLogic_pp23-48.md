Introduction 21.27
general concept of logic
In no science is the need to begin with the fact [Sache] itself, without
preliminary reflections, felt more strongly than in the science of logic. In
every other science, the matter that it treats, and the scientific method, are
distinguished from each other; the content, moreover, does not make an
absolute beginning but is dependent on other concepts and is connected
on all sides with other material. It is therefore permitted to these sciences to
speak of their ground and its context, as well of their method, in the form
of lemmas;7 to apply presupposed forms of definitions and the like without
further ado, as known and accepted; and to make use of customary ways of
argumentation in order to establish their general concepts and fundamental
determinations.
Logic, on the contrary, cannot presuppose any of these forms of reflection,
these rules and laws of thinking, for they are part of its content and
they first have to be established within it. And it is not just the declaration
of scientific method but the concept itself of science as such that belongs to
its content and even makes up its final result. Logic, therefore, cannot say
what it is in advance, rather does this knowledge of itself only emerge as
the final result and completion of its whole treatment. Likewise its subject
matter, thinking or more specifically conceptual thinking, is essentially
elaborated within it; its concept is generated in the course of this elaboration
and cannot therefore be given in advance. What is anticipated in
this Introduction, therefore, is not intended to ground as it were the concept
of logic, or to justify in advance its content and method scientifically,
but rather to make more intuitable, by means of some explanations and
reflections of an argumentative and historical nature, the standpoint from
which this science ought to be considered. 21.28

24 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
Whenever logic is taken as the science of thinking in general, it is thereby
understood that this “thinking” constitutes the mere form of a cognition;
that logic abstracts from all content, and the so-called second constitutive
piece that belongs to the cognition, namely the matter, must be given from
elsewhere; hence that logic, since this matter does not in the least depend
on it, can give only the formal conditions of genuine knowledge, but does
not itself contain real truth; or again, that logic is only the pathway to real
knowledge, for the essential component of truth, the content, lies outside
it.
But, first, to say that logic abstracts from all content, that it only teaches
the rule of thinking without being able to engage in what is being thought or
to take its composition into consideration, this alone is already inadequate.
For, since thinking and the rules of thinking are supposed to be its subject
matter, in these logic already has a content specifically its own; in them it has
that second constituent of knowledge, namely a matter whose composition
is its concern.
But, second, the notions on which the concept of logic has generally
rested so far have in part already passed away, and for the rest, it is time that
they disappear altogether, that the standpoint of this science were grasped
at a higher level, and that the science gained a completely altered shape.
The concept of logic has hitherto rested on a separation, presupposed
once and for all in ordinary consciousness, of the content of knowledge and
its form, or of truth and certainty. Presupposed from the start is that the
material of knowledge is present in and for itself as a ready-made world
outside thinking; that thinking is by itself empty, that it comes to this
material as a form from outside, fills itself with it, and only then gains a
content, thereby becoming real knowledge.
Further, these two component parts (for they are supposed to be related
to each other as component parts, and cognition is compounded from
them in a mechanical, or at best chemical, manner) are said to stand to
each other in this order: the object is complete and finished all by itself
and, for its actuality, can fully dispense with thought; thought, for its part,
is something deficient and in need of a material in order to complete itself,
and also, as a pliable indeterminate form, must adapt itself to its matter.
Truth is the agreement of thought with the subject matter, and in order to
produce this agreement – for it is not there on its own account – thought
is expected to be subservient and responsive to the subject matter.
Third, when the difference of matter and form, of subject matter and
21.29 thought, is not left in this nebulous indeterminacy but is more specifically
defined, each turns out to be a sphere divorced from the other.
The Science of Logic 25
Consequently, as thought receives and informs the material, it does not
transcend itself but its reception of this material and its responsiveness to it
remain modifications of itself; thus thought does not become its other; the
self-conscious determining, at any rate, belongs only to it; even as it refers
to the subject matter, therefore, it does not reach out to it outside itself;
the subject matter remains a thing in itself, utterly a “beyond” of thought.
These views on the relation of subject and object to each other express
the determinations that constitute the nature of our ordinary, phenomenal
consciousness. However, when these prejudices are carried over to reason,
as if in reason the same relation obtained, as if this relation had any truth
in and for itself, then they are errors, and the refutation of them in every
part of the spiritual and natural universe is what philosophy is; or rather,
since they block the entrance to philosophy, they are the errors that must
be removed before one can enter it.
The older metaphysics had in this respect a higher concept of thinking
than now passes as the accepted opinion. For it presupposed as its principle
that only what is known of things and in things by thought is really
true in them, that is, what is known in them not in their immediacy
but as first elevated to the form of thinking, as things of thought. This
metaphysics thus held that thinking and the determination of thinking are
not something alien to the subject matters, but are rather their essence,
or that the things and the thinking of them agree in and for themselves
(also our language expresses a kinship between them); that thinking in its
immanent determinations, and the true nature of things, are one and the
same content.
But the reflection of the understanding seized hold of philosophy. We
must know exactly what is meant by this saying which is otherwise often
used as a slogan. It refers in general to an understanding that abstracts and
therefore separates, that remains fixed in its separations. Turned against
reason, this understanding behaves in the manner of ordinary common sense,
giving credence to the latter’s view that truth rests on sensuous reality, that
thoughts are only thoughts, that is, that only sense perception gives filling
and reality to them; that reason, in so far as it abides in and for itself,
generates only mental figments. In this self-renunciation of reason, the
concept of truth is lost, is restricted to the knowledge of mere subjective
truth, of mere appearances, of only something to which the nature of the 21.30
fact does not correspond; knowledge has lapsed into opinion.
Yet there is something deeper lying at the foundation of this turn which
knowledge takes, and appears as a loss and a retrograde step, something
on which the elevation of reason to the loftier spirit of modern philosophy
26 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
in fact rests. The basis of that conception now universally accepted8 is to
be sought, namely, in the insight into the necessary conflict of the determinations
of the understanding with themselves. – The reflection already
mentioned consists in transcending the concrete immediate, in determining
and parting it. But this reflection must equally transcend its separating
determinations and above all connect them. The conflict of determinations
breaks out precisely at the point of connection. This reflective activity of
connection belongs in itself to reason, and to rise above the determinations
and attain insight into their discord is the great negative step on the way
to the true concept of reason. But, when not carried through, this insight
runs into the misconception that reason is the one that contradicts itself;
it fails to see that the contradiction is in fact the elevation of reason above
the restrictions of the understanding and the dissolution of them. At that
point, instead of making the final step that would take it to the summit,
knowledge flees from the unsatisfactoriness of the determinations of the
understanding to sensuous existence, believing that there it will find stability
and accord. On the other hand, since this cognition is self-admittedly a
cognition only of appearances, the unsatisfactoriness of the latter is admitted
but at the same time presupposed: as much as to say that although we do
not have cognition of things in themselves, nevertheless, within the sphere
of appearance we do have correct cognition; as if, so to speak, there were
a difference only in the kind of subject matters and one kind, namely the
things in themselves, does not fall within the scope of knowledge whereas
the other kind, namely the appearances, does.9 This is like attributing right
insight to someone, with the stipulation, however, that he is not fit to see
what is true but only what is false. Absurd as this might be, no less absurd
would be a cognition which is true but does not know its subject matter
as it is in itself.
The critique of the forms of the understanding10 has arrived precisely at this
result, namely that such forms do not apply to things in themselves. – This
can only mean that they are in themselves something untrue. However,
21.31 since they have been allowed to remain valid for reason and experience, the
critique has not altered them in any way but rather has let them be for the
subject in the same shape as they formerly applied to the object. But if they
are inadequate for the thing in itself, still less must the understanding to
which they supposedly belong have to put up with them and rest content
with them. If they cannot be determinations of the thing in itself, still less
8 i.e. the concept of truth as merely subjective. 9 This is a criticism of Kant. Cf. Bxxv.
10 The reference is to Kant. Cf. A276/B332ff.
The Science of Logic 27
can they be determinations of the understanding, to which one ought to
concede at least the dignity of a thing. The determinations of finite and
infinite run into the same conflict, whether they are applied to time and
space, to the world, or are determinations internal to the spirit – just as
black and white yield gray, whether they are mixed on a wall or on a
palette. If our representation of the world is dissolved when we carry over
to it the determinations of the infinite and finite, still more is spirit itself,
which contains both determinations within itself, something inwardly selfcontradictory,
self-dissolving. – It is not the nature of the material or of the
subject matter to which they are applied or in which they are found that
can make a difference; for it is only through such determinations, and in
accordance with them, that the subject matter has contradiction within it.
The said critique has therefore removed the forms of objective thinking
only from the thing, but has left them in the subject as it originally
found them. That is to say, it did not consider them in and for themselves,
according to their proper content, but simply took them over from subjective
logic in the manner of lemmas. There was no question, therefore,
of an immanent deduction of such forms, or also of deducing them as
logico-subjective forms, still less, of a dialectical treatment of them.
In its more consistent form, transcendental idealism did recognize the
nothingness of the spectral thing-in-itself, this abstract shadow divorced
from all content left over by critical philosophy, and its goal was to destroy
it completely. This philosophy also made a start at letting reason produce
its determinations from itself. But the subjective attitude assumed in the
attempt prevented it from coming to fruition. This attitude and, together
with it, the attempt and the cultivation of pure science were eventually
abandoned.
But what is commonly understood by logic is considered with a total
disregard of metaphysical significance. This science, in the state in which 21.32
it still finds itself, has admittedly no content of the kind which ordinary
consciousness would accept as reality, or as a genuine fact. But it is not for
that reason a formal science void of any material truth. Besides, the region
of truth is not to be sought in that material missing in it – a lack to which
the insufficiency of logic is usually attributed.More to the point is that the
emptiness of the logical forms lies rather solely in the manner in which they
are considered and dealt with. Scattered in fixed determinations and thus
not held together in organic unity, they are dead forms and the spirit which
is their vital concrete unity does not reside in them. Therefore they lack
proper content – a matter that would in itself be substance. The content
which is missed in the logical forms is nothing else than a fixed foundation
28 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
and a concretion of these abstract determinations, and such a substantial
being is usually sought for them outside them. But logical reason is itself
the substantial or real factor which, within itself, holds together all the
abstract determinations and constitutes their proper, absolutely concrete,
unity. There is no need, therefore, to look far and wide for what is usually
called a matter; it is not the fault of the subject matter of logic if the
latter seems empty but only of the manner in which this subject matter is
grasped.
This reflection brings us to a statement of the standpoint from which
logic is to be considered, of how this standpoint differs from previous
treatments of this science and is alone the true base on which the science
is to rest in the future.
In the Phenomenology of Spirit11 I have presented consciousness as it
progresses from the first immediate opposition of itself and the subject
matter to absolute knowledge. This path traverses all the forms of the
relation of consciousness to the object and its result is the concept of science.
There is no need, therefore, to justify this concept here (apart from the fact
that it emerges within logic itself ). It has already been justified in the other
work, and would indeed not be capable of any other justification than is
produced by consciousness as all its shapes dissolve into that concept as
into their truth. – A discursive justification or explanation of the concept of
21.33 science can yield at best a general notion of it and a historical acquaintance;
but a definition of science – or more precisely of logic – has its proof
only in the necessity of the manner it is produced by consciousness as
just mentioned. Any definition with which a science makes an absolute
beginning can contain nothing else than the precise and correct expression
of what is represented in one’s mind as the traditionally accepted subject
matter and purpose of the science. That just this subject matter and this
purpose are so represented is a historical warrant for invoking such or such
fact as conceded, or, more precisely, only for pleading that such or such fact
should be accepted as conceded. There will always be the possibility that
someone else will adduce a case, an instance, in which something more
and different must be understood by some term or other – a term which is
therefore to be defined in a narrower or broader sense and the science, too,
will have to be refashioned accordingly. – Further still, definition is always
a matter of argumentation as to what is to be included in it or excluded
from it, within which limits and to what extent; but argumentation is open
11 i.e. in Hegel’s final Jena work (1807). Hegel gives one summary of this process at the beginning of
Chapter 8, the concluding chapter.
The Science of Logic 29
to the most manifold and various opinions, and on these a decision can
finally be determined only arbitrarily. In this method of beginning science
with a definition, no mention is made of the need to demonstrate the
necessity of its subject matter, and hence the necessity of the science itself.
The concept of pure science and its deduction is therefore presupposed
in the present work in so far as the Phenomenology of Spirit is nothing other
than that deduction. Absolute knowledge is the truth of all the modes of
consciousness because, as the course of the Phenomenology brought out,
it is only in absolute knowledge that the separation of the subject matter
from the certainty of itself is completely resolved: truth has become equal
to certainty and this certainty to truth.
Pure science thus presupposes the liberation from the opposition of
consciousness. It contains thought in so far as this thought is equally the fact
as it is in itself; or the fact in itself in so far as this is equally pure thought.
As science, truth is pure self-consciousness as it develops itself and has the
shape of the self, so that that which exists in and for itself is the conscious
concept and the concept as such is that which exists in and for itself. 21.34
This objective thinking is thus the content of pure science. Consequently,
far from being formal, far from lacking the matter required for an actual
and true cognition, it is its content which alone has absolute truth, or,
if one still wanted to make use of the word “matter,” which alone is the
veritable matter – a matter for which the form is nothing external, because
this matter is rather pure thought and hence the absolute form itself.
Accordingly, logic is to be understood as the system of pure reason, as the
realm of pure thought. This realm is truth unveiled, truth as it is in and for
itself. It can therefore be said that this content is the exposition of God as he
is in his eternal essence before the creation of nature and of a finite spirit.
Anaxagoras is celebrated as the man who first gave voice to the thought
that Nous, thought, is the principle of the world; that the essence of the
world is to be defined as thought.12 In this, he laid down the foundation for
an intellectual view of the universe, the pure shape of which must be logic.
Logic has nothing to do with a thought about something which stands
outside by itself as the base of thought; nor does it have to do with forms
meant to provide mere markings of the truth; rather, the necessary forms of
thinking, and its specific determinations, are the content and the ultimate
truth itself.
To get at least some inkling of this, one must put aside the notion that
truth must be something tangible. Such tangibility, for example, is carried
12 Cf. Aristotle, Metaph., 984b.
30 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
over even into the ideas of Plato which are in God’s thought, as if they were,
so to speak, things that exist but in another world or region, and a world of
actuality were to be found outside them which has a substantiality distinct
from those ideas and is real only because of this distinctness. The Platonic
idea is nothing else than the universal, or, more precisely, it is the concept of
the subject matter; it is only in the concept that something has actuality, and
to the extent that it is different from its concept, it ceases to be actual and is
a nullity; the side of tangibility and of sensuous self-externality belongs to
this null side. – But on the other side one can appeal to the representations
typical of ordinary logic; for it is assumed that in definitions, for example,
the determinations are not just of the knowing subject but are rather
determinations of the subject matter, such that constitute its innermost
essential nature. Or in an inference drawn from given determinations to
others, the assumption is that the inferred is not something external to the
21.35 subject matter and alien to it, but that it belongs to it instead, that to the
thought there corresponds being. – Everywhere presupposed by the use
of the forms of the concept, of judgment, inference, definition, division,
etc., is that they are not mere forms of self-conscious thinking but also of
objective understanding. – Thought is an expression which attributes the
determination contained in it primarily to consciousness. But inasmuch
as it is said that understanding, that reason, is in the objective world, that
spirit and nature have universal laws to which their life and their changes
conform, then it is conceded just as much that the determinations of
thought have objective value and concrete existence.
Critical philosophy did indeed already turn metaphysics into logic but, like
the subsequent idealism, it gave to the logical determinations an essentially
subjective significance out of fear of the object, as we said earlier;13 for
that reason, these determinations remained affected by the very object that
they avoided, and were left with the remains of a thing-in-itself, an infinite
check, as a beyond. But the liberation from the opposition of consciousness
that science must be able to presuppose elevates the determinations of
thought above this anxious, incomplete standpoint, and demands that
they be considered for what they are in and for themselves without any
such cautious restriction, as the logical, the purely rational.
Kant thought further of logic, that is, the aggregate of definitions and
propositions that ordinarily passes for logic, as fortunate because, as contrasted
with other sciences, it was its lot to attain an early completion; since
Aristotle, it has taken no backward step, but also none forward, the latter
13 Hegel is probably referring to 21.29, above.
The Science of Logic 31
because to all appearances it seems to be finished and complete. If logic has
not undergone change since Aristotle – and in fact, judging from the latest
compendiums of logic, the usual changes mostly consist only of omissions –
then surely the conclusion to be drawn is that it is all the more in need
of a total reworking; for the two thousand years of spirit’s continuous
labor must have procured for it a higher consciousness about its thinking
and the purity of its inner essence. A comparison of the shapes to
which the spirit of the practical and the religious world, and of science
in every form of real or idealized consciousness, has raised itself, with
the shape in which logic, spirit’s consciousness of its own pure essence,
finds itself, reveals too wide a difference that one would not be struck, 21.36
even on the most superficial observation, by the disproportion and the
unworthiness of the latter consciousness as contrasted with spirit’s other
elevations.
As a matter of fact, the need for a reformation of logic has long been
felt. In the form and content in which it is found in the textbooks, it must
be said that it has fallen into disrepute. It is still being dragged along, more
from a feeling that one cannot dispense with a logic altogether and the
persisting traditional belief in its importance, than from any conviction
that such a commonplace content and the occupation with such empty
forms are of any value or use.
The additions of psychological, pedagogical, and even physiological
material which logic was at one time given, have later been almost universally
recognized as disfigurations. A large part of these psychological,
pedagogical, or physiological observations, of these laws and rules, whether
they occur in logic or anywhere else, must appear in and for themselves to
be quite shallow and trivial. The rule, for instance, that one should think
through and personally test what one reads in books or hears by word of
mouth; or, if one has poor sight, that one should aid the eyes with spectacles
– rules which were offered for the attainment of truth in the textbooks
of so-called applied logic, and even pompously set out in paragraphs –
these must immediately strike everyone as superfluous – apart from the
writer or the teacher who is in the embarrassing position of having to
pad with extra material the otherwise too short and lifeless content of
logic.c,14
c A just published and most up-to-date adaptation of this science, Fries’s System of Logic [1811,
Introduction §1] goes back to its anthropological foundations. The shallowness of the representation
or opinion on which it is based, in and of itself, and of the execution, dispenses me from the trouble
of taking any notice of this insignificant publication.
14 Note in the first edition, dropped in the second.
32 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
Regarding this content, the reason why it is so spiritless has already been
given above. Its determinations are accepted in their undisturbed fixity
and are brought together only in external connection. Since in judgments
and syllogisms the operations are mostly reduced to, and founded upon,
the quantitative aspect of the determinations, everything rests on external
differentiation, on mere comparison, and becomes a completely analytical
procedure and a calculus void of concept. The deduction of the so-called
rules and laws, of inference especially, is no better than the manipulation
of rods of unequal lengths for sorting them out in groups according to
size – than a children’s game of fitting together the pieces of a colored
picture puzzle. – Not incorrectly, therefore, has this thinking been equated
21.37 with reckoning, and reckoning again with this thinking.15 In mathematics,
numbers have no conceptual content, no meaning outside equality
or inequality, that is, outside relations which are entirely external; neither
in themselves nor in connection are they a thought. When one mechanically
calculates that three-fourths multiplied by two-thirds makes one-half,
this operation contains about as much and as little thought as estimating
whether in a logical figure this or that kind of syllogism applies.
For the dead bones of logic to be quickened by spirit and become
substance and content, its method must be the one which alone can make
it fit to be pure science. In the present situation of logic, hardly a trace of
scientific method is to be seen in it. It has roughly the form of an empirical
science. The empirical sciences did find a method of defining and classifying
their material specifically suited, such as it is, to what they are supposed
to be. Pure mathematics, too, has its method suited to its abstract objects
and the quantitative form in which alone it considers them. In the Preface
to the Phenomenology of Spirit, I have said what is essential regarding this
method and, in general, the derived form of scientific procedure proper
to mathematics,16 but we shall return to it in more detail within the logic
itself.17 Spinoza, Wolff, and others, have let themselves be led astray into
applying that method also to philosophy and in making the conceptually
void external course of quantity, the course of the concept – a move
contradictory in and for itself. Hitherto philosophy had yet to find its
method but looked with envy at the systematic edifice of mathematics and,
15 Hegel is referring to Reinhold, at the time when the latter had espoused the philosophy of C. G.
Bardili. Reinhold defines thought as “the determinable and, to this extent, finite repeatability of one
and just this one in an other, through the indeterminable and, to this extent, infinite repeatability of
one and just this one in one and just this one determining.” He calls this process a “Rechnen.” K. L.

The Science of Logic 33
as we have said, borrowed it from it or helped itself with the method of
sciences which are only an admixture of given material, propositions of
experience and thoughts – or it even resorted to the crude rejection of all
method. But the exposition of that which alone can be the true method of
philosophical science falls within the treatment of logic itself; for method
is the consciousness of the form of the inner self-movement of the content
of logic. In the Phenomenology of Spirit, I have presented an example of this
method with respect to a concrete object, namely consciousness.d At issue
there are shapes of consciousness, each of which dissolves itself in being 21.38
realized, has its own negation for result – and thereby has gone over to a
higher shape. The one thing needed to achieve scientific progress – and it
is essential to make an effort at gaining this quite simple insight into it –
is the recognition of the logical principle that negation is equally positive,
or that what is self-contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into
abstract nothingness, but essentially only into the negation of its particular
content; or that such a negation is not just negation, but is the negation of
the determined fact which is resolved, and is therefore determinate negation;
that in the result there is therefore contained in essence that from which
the result derives – a tautology indeed, since the result would otherwise be
something immediate and not a result. Because the result, the negation, is
a determinate negation, it has a content. It is a new concept but one higher
and richer than the preceding – richer because it negates or opposes the
preceding and therefore contains it, and it contains even more than that,
for it is the unity of itself and its opposite. – It is above all in this way
that the system of concepts is to be to erected – and it has to come to
completion in an unstoppable and pure progression that admits of nothing
extraneous.
How could I possibly pretend that the method that I follow in this
system of logic, or rather the method that this system itself follows within,
would not be capable of greater perfection, of greater elaboration of detail?
Yet I know that it is the one and only true method. This is made obvious
by the very fact that this method is not something distinct from its subject
matter and content – for it is the content in itself, the dialectic which it
possesses within itself, which moves the subject matter forward. It is clear
that no expositions can be accepted as scientifically valid that do not follow
the progression of this method and are not in tune with its simple rhythm,
for it is the course of the fact itself.
d Later, with respect to other concrete objects and corresponding parts of philosophy.
34 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
In keeping with this method, I remind the reader that the divisions and
the headings of the books, the sections and chapters given in this work, as
well as the explanations associated with them, are made for the purpose of
a preliminary overview, and that strictly speaking they only are of historical
value. They do not belong to the content and body of the science but
21.39 are rather compilations of an external reflection which has already gone
through the whole of the exposition, therefore knows the sequence of its
moments in advance and anticipates them before they are brought on by
the matter at issue itself.
Similarly in other sciences, preliminary definitions and divisions are by
themselves nothing other than such external indications; but also within
the science they never exceed this status. Even in logic, for example, we are
told something like this, that “logic has two main parts, the doctrine of the
elements and methodology,” and under the doctrine of the elements we
then immediately find such headings as “Laws of Thinking,” followed by
Chapter One, “On Concepts,” Section One, “On the Clarity of Concepts,”
etc. – These definitions and divisions, made without any deduction and
justification, constitute the systematic framework and the entire connectedness
of such sciences. Such a logic considers it its vocation to talk about
the necessity of deducing concepts and truths from principles; however, of
what they call method, there is not the shadow of a deduction. Order consists
in something like grouping together what is alike, in bringing in the
simple ahead of the composite, and in other such external considerations.
But as regards any internal, necessary connectedness, the list of headings
is all that there is, and a transition is made simply by saying that now
we are at “Chapter Two,” or that “we now come to judgments,” and the
like.
Also the headings and divisions that appear in the present system are
not intended to have for themselves any other significance than that of an
indication of content. But then the necessity of the connectedness and the
immanent emergence of distinctions must be found in the treatment of the
fact itself, for it falls within the concept’s own progressive determination.
What propels the concept onward is the already mentioned negative18
which it possesses in itself; it is this that constitutes the truly dialectical
factor. Dialectic, once considered a separate part of logic and, one may say,
entirely misunderstood so far as its purpose and standpoint are concerned,
21.40 thereby assumes a totally different position. – Even the Platonic dialectic,
in the Parmenides itself and elsewhere even more directly, on the one hand
18 Cf. above, 21.28.
The Science of Logic 35
only has the aim of refuting limited assertions by internally dissolving them
and, on the other hand, generally comes only to a negative result. Dialectic
is commonly regarded as an external and negative activity which does
not belong to the fact itself but is rooted in mere conceit, in a subjective
obsession for subverting and bringing to naught everything firm and true,
or at least as in resulting in nothing but the vanity of the subject matter
subjected to dialectical treatment.
Kant had a higher regard for dialectic – and this is among his greatest
merits – for he removed from it the semblance of arbitrariness which it
has in ordinary thought and presented it as a necessary operation of reason.19
Because dialectic was held to be merely the art of practicing deceptions and
producing illusions, it was straight away assumed that it plays a false game;
that its whole power rests solely on hiding its deception; that its results
are only deviously obtained, a subjective shine. True, Kant’s dialectical
displays in the antinomies of pure reason, when examined more closely as
will be done at length in the course of this work,20 do not deserve great
praise; but the general idea to which he gave justification and credence is
the objectivity of reflective shine and the necessity of the contradiction which
belongs to the nature of thought determinations: of course, this he did above
all with reference to the way in which these determinations are applied by
reason to the things in themselves; nevertheless, what such determinations
are in reason, and with reference to what is in itself, this is precisely their
nature. This result, grasped in its positive aspect, is nothing else but the
inner negativity of the determinations which is their self-moving soul, the
principle of all natural and spiritual life. But if one stays fixed at the abstract
negative aspect of dialectics, the result is only the commonplace that reason
is incapable of knowing the infinite – a peculiar result indeed, for it says
that, since the infinite is what is rational, reason is not capable of cognizing
the rational.
It is in this dialectic as understood here, and hence in grasping opposites
in their unity, or the positive in the negative, that the speculative consists. 21.41
It is the most important aspect of dialectic, but for the still unpracticed,
unfree faculty of thought, the most difficult. Such a faculty, if still occupied
with breaking itself free of the concrete representations of the senses and
of ratiocination, must first practice abstract thinking, hold fast to concepts
in their determinateness and learn to gain knowledge by means of them.
An exposition of logic to this end would have, in its method, to keep
to a subject division as mentioned above, and with regard to the more
19 Cf. A321/B377ff. 20 Cf below, 21.179ff., 228ff.
36 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
detailed content, to the definitions given to the single concepts, without
getting itself involved in dialectic. In external shape, it would turn out to
be similar to the usual presentation of this science, yet would also depart
from it in content and, though of no use for the practice of speculative
thinking, it would however serve abstract thinking, and this is a purpose
which can never be realized by a logic popularized with the additions of
psychological and anthropological materials. What it would give to the
mind is the picture of a methodically ordered whole, even though the soul
of the edifice, the method dwelling in the dialectic, would not itself appear
in it.
Finally, with respect to the education and the relation of the individual
to logic, I would further remark that this science, like grammar, appears
in two different aspects or values. It is one thing for one who comes to it
and to the sciences generally for the first time, and something else for one
who returns to it from these sciences. He who is beginning to make his
acquaintance with grammar finds in its forms and laws dry abstractions,
arbitrary rules, quite in general a disconnected aggregate of definitions that
have no other value or meaning than what they immediately signify; at the
start, there is nothing to be known in them except themselves.On the other
hand, he who has mastered a language and is also acquainted with other
languages with which to compare it, to such is given the capacity to feel in
the grammar of the language the spirit and culture of a people; the same
rules and forms now have an enriched, living value. In the medium of the
language, he can recognize the expression of spirit as spirit, and this is logic.
So, he who first comes to this science, at first finds in logic an isolated system
of abstractions which, confined to itself, does not reach over to embrace
other forms of cognition and of science.On the contrary, when held against
the riches of the world-scenario, against the apparently real content of the
other sciences; when compared with the promise of the absolute science
to unveil the essence of these riches, to unveil the inner nature of spirit
21.42 and of the world, the truth, then in the abstractness of its shape, in the
colorlessness and stark simplicity of its pure determinations; this science
has rather the look of one who can sooner afford anything than any such
promise but stands penniless before those riches. The first acquaintance
with logic restricts its significance to it alone; its content passes only for an
isolated occupation with thought determinations, next to which the other
scientific endeavors constitute a material and content of their own, one
over which logical thought may indeed have some formal influence, but
an influence which is more of their own making and which, if need be,
scientific form and the study of this form can at any rate also dispense with.
The Science of Logic 37
The other sciences have on the whole discarded the well-regulated method
of proceeding by way of definitions, axioms, theorems and their proofs,
and so on; so-called natural logic has become their accepted norm and
this manages to do its work without any specialized knowledge of thought
itself. All in all, the matter and the content of these sciences stand totally
independent of logic and are also better suited to the senses, to feeling, the
imagination, and any kind of practical interest.
So logic must indeed at first be learned as something which one may well
understand and penetrate into but in which, at the beginning, one misses
the scope, depth, and broader significance. Only after a more profound
acquaintance with the other sciences does logic rise for subjective spirit
from a merely abstract universal to a universal that encompasses within
itself the riches of the particular: in the same way a moral maxim does not
possess in the mouth of a youngster who otherwise understands it quite
well the meaning and scope that it has in the spirit of a man with a lifetime
of experience, to whom therefore the weight of its content is expressed
in full force. Thus logic receives full appreciation of its value only when
it comes as the result of the experience of the sciences; then it displays
itself to spirit as the universal truth, not as a particular cognition alongside
another material and other realities, but as the essence rather of this further
content.
Now although this power of logic is not consciously present to spirit at
the beginning of its study, such a study will nevertheless impart to it the
inward power which will lead it to the truth. The system of logic is the
realm of shadows, the world of simple essentialities, freed of all sensuous
concretion. To study this science, to dwell and to labor in this realm of
shadows, is the absolute culture and discipline of consciousness. Its task
is one which is remote from the intuitions and the goals of the senses, 21.43
remote from feelings and from the world of merely fancied representation.
Considered from its negative side, this task consists in holding off the
accidentality of ratiocinative thought and the arbitrariness in the choice to
accept one ground as valid rather than its opposite.
But above all, thought thereby gains self-subsistence and independence.
It will make itself at home in abstractions and in the ways of working with
concepts without sensuous substrata, will develop an unconscious power to
assimilate in rational form the otherwise dispersed manifold of cognitions
and sciences, the power to grasp and hold them in their essentiality, to
strip them of every externality and in this way to abstract from them the
logical element – or what is the same thing, the power to fill the abstract
groundwork of logic previously acquired through study with the content of
38 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
every truth, and to bestow upon this content the value of a universal which
no longer stands as a particular alongside other particulars but embraces
21.44 them all in its grasp and is their essence, the absolutely true.
general division of the logic
It follows from what has been said regarding the concept of this science
and where its justification lies that the general division of it can be only
provisional here – can be given, as it were, only in so far as the author is
already acquainted with the science and is consequently historically in a
position to indicate in advance the main distinctions in which the concept
assumes determination as it develops.
Still, the attempt can be made to elicit in advance some general understanding
of what is required for performing the division, although even
here recourse must be made to a procedural method which will attain
full disclosure and justification only within the science. – One must thus
be reminded, first and foremost, that presupposed here is that the division
must be connected with the concept, or rather must lie in the concept itself.
The concept is not indeterminate but is determinate within; the division,
however, expresses this determinateness of the concept in developed form;
it is the parting of the concept in judgment,21 not a judgment about some
subject matter or other picked out externally, but the judging, that is, the
determining, of the concept within it. Right-angularity, acute-angularity,
etc., or equilaterality, which are the determinations according to which
triangles are divided, do not lie in the determinateness of the triangle itself,
that is, not in what is usually called the concept of a triangle, no more than
in the concept of animal in general, or of mammal, bird, etc., one can find
the determinations according to which animal in general is divided into
mammal, bird, etc., and these classes are then divided into further genera.
Such determinations are taken from elsewhere, from empirical intuition;
they come to those so-called concepts from without. In the philosophical
treatment of division, the concept must show that it itself holds the source
of the determinations.
21.45 But in the Introduction, the concept of logic was itself presented as the
result of a science that transcends it, and hence as equally a presupposition
here. Accordingly, logic was defined as the science of pure thought – the
science that has pure knowledge for its principle and is a unity which is not
21 parting . . . in judgment = Urteil. The German Urteil (“judgment”) connotes a “parting,” like the
Greek 	

.
The Science of Logic 39
abstract but living and concrete, so that the opposition of consciousness
between a being subjectively existing for itself, and another but objectively
existing such being, has been overcome in it, and being is known to be in
itself a pure concept and the pure concept to be true being. These, then,
are the two moments contained in logic. But they are now known to exist
inseparably, not as in consciousness, where each exists for itself; it is for this
reason and this reason alone, because they are at the same time known to
be distinct (yet not to exist for themselves), that their unity is not abstract,
dead and inert, but concrete.
This unity also constitutes the logical principle as element,22 so that the
development of the distinction which is from the start present in it proceeds
only inside this element. For since the division is, as we said, the parting or
the judgment of the concept – is the positing of the determination which is
already immanent in it and therefore the positing of its distinction – this
positing must not be understood as resolving that concrete unity back into
its determinations, as if these were to exist on their own, for this would
be here a vacuous return to the previous standpoint, to the opposition
of consciousness. But this opposition has vanished; the unity remains the
element, and the distinctions of the division and of the development in
general no longer transgress that unity. Therefore the earlier determinations
which (on the pathway to truth) existed for themselves, as for instance that
of subjective and objective, or also of thought and being, of concept and
reality, no matter from what standpoint they were determined, are now
in their truth, that is, in their unity, reduced to forms. In their difference
they therefore implicitly remain, in themselves, the whole concept, and this
concept is posited in the division only under its own determinations.
Thus it is the whole concept which we must consider, first as existent
concept, and then as concept; in the one case it is concept only implicitly,
in itself, the concept of reality or being; in the other, it is the concept as
such, the concept that exists for itself (in more concrete forms, the concept
as it is in the human being, who is endowed with thought, and also in
the sentient animal and in general in organic individuality, although, of
course, in these last it is not conscious and still less known; it is concept in
itself only in inorganic nature). – Accordingly, the first division must be
between the logic of the concept as being and of the concept as concept, or 21.46
(if we want to avail ourselves of otherwise familiar, but very indeterminate
and therefore very ambiguous expressions) in objective and subjective logic.
22 “Element” has classical connotations here. Like “water,” “fire,” or “air,” this unity is a pervasive
element that embraces differences.
40 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
However, in accordance with the elemental unity which is immanent in
the concept as basis, and hence in accordance with the inseparability of the
concept’s determinations, such determinations, even as differentiated (the
concept is posited in their difference), must also stand at least in reference to
each another. There results a sphere of mediation, the concept as a system
of reflected determinations, that is, of being as it passes over into the initselfness
of the concept – a concept which is in this way not yet posited
for itself as such but is also fettered by an immediate being still external to
it. This sphere is the doctrine of essence that stands between the doctrine of
being and of the concept. – In the general division of logic in this work,
it has been included in objective logic because, although essence is indeed
already inwardness, the character of subject is to be reserved nominatim for
the concept.
Recently Kante has opposed to what has usually been called “logic”
21.47 another, namely a transcendental logic.24 What has been called objective
logic here would correspond in part to what for him is transcendental
logic. Kant distinguishes it from what he calls general logic because ()
it deals with concepts that refer to intended objects a priori, and hence
does not abstract from all the content of objective cognition, or in that it
contains the rules of the pure thinking of an intended object; and because
() it thereby goes to the source of our cognition so far as this cognition
cannot be attributed to the intended objects. – It is to this second
aspect that Kant’s philosophical interest is exclusively directed. His principal
idea is to vindicate the categories for self-consciousness understood as the
e I should point out that in this work I make frequent references to the Kantian philosophy (which to
many might seem superfluous) because, whatever might be said here or elsewhere of its distinctive
character or of particular parts of its exposition, it constitutes the foundation and the starting point
of the new German philosophy, and this is a merit of which it can boast undiminished by whatever
fault may be found in it. An added reason for these frequent references in the objective logic is
that Kantian philosophy delves deeply into important, more specific aspects of the logic, whereas
later philosophical expositions have paid little attention to these aspects and in some instances have
even expressed crude – though not unavenged – contempt for them. The philosophizing most
widespread among us does not reach past the Kantian results that reason cannot cognize any true
content, and that, when it comes to absolute truth, it must be directed to faith.23 But what for Kant
is the result is for this philosophizing the immediate starting point, so that the exposition which
precedes the result, from which this result is derived and which constitutes philosophical cognition,
is excised beforehand. The philosophy of Kant thus serves as a cushion for an intellectual indolence
which takes comfort in the fact that everything is already proved and settled. For cognition and a
specific content of thought which is not found in such a barren and arid complacency, one must
therefore turn to that preceding exposition.
23 The allusion here is at least to Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi. Cf. Jacobi, David Hume ¨uber den Glauben,
oder Idealismus und Realismus, Ein Gespr¨ach (Breslau, 1787), pp. 48–49; Werke: Gesamtausgabe,

The Science of Logic 41
subjective “I.”25 Because of this determination, his point of view remains
confined within consciousness and its opposition, and, besides the empirical
element of feeling and intuition, is left with something else not posited
or determined by thinking self-consciousness, a thing-in-itself, something
alien and external to thinking – although it is easy to see that such an
abstract entity as the thing-in-itself is itself only the product of thought,
and of merely abstractive thought at that. – If other Kantians26 have
expanded on the determining of the intended object by the “I” by saying
that the objectifying of the “I” is to be regarded as an original and necessary
deed of consciousness, so that in this original deed there is not yet the
representation of the “I” – which would be only a consciousness of that
consciousness, or itself an objectifying of that consciousness – then this
objectifying deed, liberated from the opposition of consciousness, is closer
to what may be taken simply as thinking as such.f But this deed should
no longer be called consciousness; for consciousness holds within itself the 21.48
opposition of the “I” and its intended object which is not to be found
in that original deed.27 The name “consciousness” gives it more of a semblance
of subjectivity than does the term “thought,” which here, however,
is to be taken in the absolute sense of infinite thought, not as encumbered
by the finitude of consciousness; in short, thought as such.
Now because the interest of the Kantian philosophy was directed to
the so-called transcendental nature of the categories, the treatment itself
of such categories came up empty. What they are in themselves apart
from their abstract relation to the “I,” a relation which is the same for all,
how they are determined and related to each other, this was not made a
subject of consideration, and therefore knowledge of their nature was not
in the least advanced by this philosophy. What alone is of interest in this
connection comes only in the Critique of Ideas. – However, if there was
to be a real progress in philosophy, it was necessary that the interest of
f If the expression, the “objectifying deed of the ‘I’,” brings to mind other products of spirit, e.g.
those of fantasy, it is to be observed that we are speaking of the determining of an intended object
inasmuch as the elements of its content do not belong to feeling and intuition. The intended object
is here a thought, and to determine it means both to produce it originally, and also, inasmuch as it
is something presupposed, to have further thoughts about it, to develop it further by thinking.
25 Cf., among other places, the B edition of the Critique of Pure Reason, §§25, 26.
26 The most obvious allusion is to J. G. Fichte. For a clear statement of Fichte’s still early position
on the matter, see his Zweite Einleitung in die Wissenschaftslehre, Philosophisches Journal, 6 (1797)
§5; English trans., Second Introduction to the Wissenschaftslehre, trans. and ed. Daniel Breazeale
(Indianapolis: Hackett, 1994), pp. 46ff.; GA I.4.463.
27 Fichte was aware of this. Cf.: “I become conscious only of the concepts involved, that is, the concept
of the object and the concept of the goal, not however of the two intuitions [i.e. intellectual intuition
and intuition of the senses] that lie at the basis of these concepts.” Fichte, Second Introduction to the
Wissenschaftslehre, p. 47; GA I.4, 467.
42 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
thought should be drawn to the consideration of the formal side, of the
“I,” of consciousness as such, that is, of the abstract reference of a subjective
awareness to an object, and that in this way the path should be opened for
the cognition of the infinite form, that is, of the concept. Yet, in order to
arrive at this cognition, the finite determinateness in which that form is
as “I,” as consciousness, must be shed. The form, when thought out in its
purity, will then have within itself the capacity to determine itself, that is,
to give itself a content, and to give it as a necessary content – as a system
of thought-determinations.
The objective logic thus takes the place rather of the former metaphysics
which was supposed to be the scientific edifice of the world as constructed
by thoughts alone. – If we look at the final shape in the elaboration of this
science, then it is ontology which objective logic most directly replaces in
the first instance, that is, that part of metaphysics intended to investigate
the nature of ens in general28 (and ens comprises within itself both being and
21.49 essence, a distinction for which the German language has fortunately preserved
different expressions). – But objective logic comprises within itself
also the rest of metaphysics, the metaphysics which sought to comprehend
with the pure forms of thought such particular substrata, originally drawn
from the imagination,29 as the soul, the world, and God, and in this type of
consideration the determinations of thought constituted the essential factor.
Logic, however, considers these forms free of those substrata, which are
the subjects of figurative representation, considers their nature and value in
and for themselves. That metaphysics neglected to do this, and it therefore
incurred the just reproach that it employed the pure forms of thought
uncritically, without previously investigating whether and how they could
be the determinations of the thing-in-itself, to use Kant’s expression –
or more precisely, of the rational. – The objective logic is therefore the
true critique of such determinations – a critique that considers them, not
according to the abstract form of the a priori as contrasted with the a
posteriori, but in themselves according to their particular content.
The subjective logic is the logic of the concept – of essence which has
sublated its reference to a being or to its reflective shine, and in its determination
is no longer external but something subjective, freely self-subsisting,
self-determining, or rather the subject itself. – Since subjective brings with
it the misconception of “accidental” and “arbitrary” and also, in general,

Wolff, Philosophia prima, sive ontologia, methodo scientifica pertractata (Frankfurt & Leipzig, 1736),

The Science of Logic 43
of determinations that belong to the form of consciousness, no particular
weight is to be attached here to the distinction of subjective and objective.
This is a distinction which will be more precisely developed later in the
logic itself.
Logic thus divides overall into objective and subjective logic, but more
specifically it has three parts:
I. The Logic of Being,
II. The Logic of Essence, and
III. The Logic of the Concept.

with what must the beginning of science be made?
It is only in recent times that there has been a new awareness of the difficulty
of finding a beginning in philosophy, and the reason for this difficulty, and
so also the possibility of resolving it, have been discussed in a variety of
ways. The beginning of philosophy must be either something mediated or
something immediate, and it is easy to show that it can be neither the one
nor the other; so either way of beginning runs into contradiction.1
The principle of a philosophy also expresses a beginning, of course,
but not so much a subjective as an objective one, the beginning of all
things. The principle is a somehow determinate content – “water,” “the
one,” “nous,” “idea,” or “substance,” “monad,” etc. – or, if it designates
the nature of cognition and is therefore meant simply as a criterion rather
than an objective determination, as “thinking,” “intuition,” “sensation,”
“I,” even “subjectivity,” then here too the interest still lies in the content
determination. The beginning as such, on the other hand, as something
subjective in the sense that it is an accidental way of introducing the
exposition, is left unconsidered, a matter of indifference, and consequently
also the need to ask with what a beginning should be made remains of no
importance in face of the need for the principle in which alone the interest
of the fact seems to lie, the interest as to what is the truth, the absolute
ground of everything.
But the modern perplexity about a beginning proceeds from a further
need which escapes those who are either busy demonstrating their principle
dogmatically or skeptically looking for a subjective criterion against
dogmatic philosophizing, and is outright denied by those who begin, like
a shot from a pistol, from their inner revelation, from faith, intellectual
1 There is an allusion here to Fichte. Cf. Grundlage der gesammten Wissenschaftslehre (1794), English

Press, 1982), pp. 93ff. GA, I.2, 255ff.

46 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
intuition, etc. and who would be exempt from method and logic.2 If earlier
abstract thought is at first interested only in the principle as content, but
21.54 is driven as philosophical culture advances to the other side to pay attention
to the conduct of the cognitive process, then the subjective activity has
also been grasped as an essential moment of objective truth, and with this
there comes the need to unite the method with the content, the form with
the principle. Thus the principle ought to be also the beginning, and that
which has priority for thinking ought to be also the first in the process of
thinking.
Here we only have to consider how the logical beginning appears. The
two sides from which it can be taken have already been named, namely
either by way of mediation as result, or immediately as beginning proper.
This is not the place to discuss the question apparently so important
to present-day culture, whether the knowledge of truth is an immediate
awareness that begins absolutely, a faith, or rather a mediated knowledge.
In so far as the issue allows passing treatment, this has already been done
elsewhere (in my Encyclopedia of the Philosophical Sciences, 3rd edn, in the
Prefatory Concept, §§21ff.). Here we may quote from it only this, that
there is nothing in heaven or nature or spirit or anywhere else that does
not contain just as much immediacy as mediation, so that both these
determinations prove to be unseparated and inseparable and the opposition
between them nothing real. As for a scientific discussion, a case in point is
every logical proposition in whichwe find the determinations of immediacy
and mediacy and where there is also entailed, therefore, a discussion of their
opposition and their truth. This opposition, when connected to thinking,
to knowledge, to cognition, assumes the more concrete shape of immediate
or mediated knowledge, and it is then up to the science of logic to consider
the nature of cognition in general, while the more concrete forms of
the same cognition fall within the scope of the science of spirit and the
phenomenology of spirit. But to want to clarify the nature of cognition
prior to science is to demand that it should be discussed outside science,
and outside science this cannot be done, at least not in the scientific manner
which alone is the issue here.
A beginning is logical in that it is to be made in the element of a free,
self-contained thought, in pure knowledge; it is thereby mediated, for pure
knowledge is the ultimate and absolute truth of consciousness. We said in
the Introduction that the Phenomenology of Spirit is the science of consciousness,
its exposition; that consciousness has the concept of science,
2 The allusion here is most likely to Jacobi. Cf. also the Preface to the Phenomenology, GW9, 24.10–12.
The Doctrine of Being 47
that is, pure knowledge, for its result.3 To this extent, logic has for its
presupposition the science of spirit in its appearance, a science which
contains the necessity, and therefore demonstrates the truth, of the stand- 21.55
point which is pure knowledge and of its mediation. In this science of
spirit in its appearance the beginning is made from empirical, sensuous
consciousness, and it is this consciousness which is immediate knowledge
in the strict sense; there, in this science, is where its nature is discussed.
Any other consciousness, such as faith in divine truths, inner experience,
knowledge through inner revelation, etc., proves upon cursory reflection
to be very ill-suited as an instance of immediate knowledge. In the said
treatise, immediate consciousness is also that which in the science comes
first and immediately and is therefore a presupposition; but in logic the
presupposition is what has proved itself to be the result of that preceding
consideration, namely the idea as pure knowledge. Logic is the pure science,
that is, pure knowledge in the full compass of its development. But in
that result the idea has the determination of a certainty that has become
truth; it is a certainty which, on the one hand, no longer stands over and
against a subject matter confronting it externally but has interiorized it, is
knowingly aware that the subject matter is itself; and, on the other hand,
has relinquished any knowledge of itself that would oppose it to objectivity
and would reduce the latter to a nothing; it has externalized this subjectivity
and is at one with its externalization.
Now starting with this determination of pure knowledge, all that we have
to do to ensure that the beginning will remain immanent to the science
of this knowledge is to consider, or rather, setting aside every reflection,
simply to take up, what is there before us.
Pure knowledge, thus withdrawn into this unity, has sublated every
reference to an other and to mediation; it is without distinctions and as
thus distinctionless it ceases to be knowledge; what we have before us is
only simple immediacy.
Simple immediacy is itself an expression of reflection; it refers to the
distinction from what is mediated. The true expression of this simple
immediacy is therefore pure being. Just as pure knowledge should mean
nothing but knowledge as such, so also pure being should mean nothing
but being in general; being, and nothing else, without further determination 21.56
and filling.
Being is what makes the beginning here; it is presented indeed as originating
through mediation, but a mediation which at the same time sublates
3 Cf above, 21.32.
48 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
itself, and the presupposition is of a pure knowledge which is the result
of finite knowledge, of consciousness. But if no presupposition is to be
made, if the beginning is itself to be taken immediately, then the only
determination of this beginning is that it is to be the beginning of logic, of
thought as such. There is only present the resolve, which can also be viewed
as arbitrary, of considering thinking as such. The beginning must then be
absolute or, what means the same here, must be an abstract beginning; and
so there is nothing that it may presuppose, must not be mediated by anything
or have a ground, ought to be rather itself the ground of the entire science.
It must therefore be simply an immediacy, or rather only immediacy itself.
Just as it cannot have any determination with respect to an other, so too it
cannot have any within; it cannot have any content, for any content would
entail distinction and the reference of distinct moments to each other, and
hence a mediation. The beginning is therefore pure being.
After this simple exposition of what alone first belongs to this simplest of
all simples, the logical beginning, we may add the following further reflections
which should not serve, however, as elucidation and confirmation of
the exposition – this is complete by itself – but are rather occasioned by
notions and reflections which may come our way beforehand and yet, like
all other prejudices that antedate the science of logic, must be disposed
of within the science itself and are therefore to be patiently deferred until
then.
The insight that absolute truth must be a result, and conversely, that a
result presupposes a first truth which, because it is first, objectively considered
is not necessary and from the subjective side is not known – this
insight has recently given rise to the thought that philosophy can begin only
21.57 with something which is hypothetically and problematically true, and that
at first, therefore, philosophizing can be only a quest. This is a view that
Reinhold has repeatedly urged in the later stages of his philosophizing,4
and which must be given credit for being motivated by a genuine interest
in the speculative nature of philosophical beginning. A critical examination
of this view will also be an occasion for introducing a preliminary understanding
of what progression in logic generally means, for the view has
direct implications for the nature of this advance. Indeed, as portrayed by
it, progression in philosophy would be rather a retrogression and a grounding,
only by virtue of which it then follows as result that that, with which
the beginning was made, was not just an arbitrary assumption but was in
fact the truth, and the first truth at that.
