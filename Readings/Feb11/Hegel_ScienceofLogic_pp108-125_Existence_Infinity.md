C. INFINITY
The infinite in its simple concept can be regarded, first of all, as a fresh
definition of the absolute; as self-reference devoid of determination, it is
posited as being and becoming. The forms of existence have no place in the
series of determinations that can be regarded as definitions of the absolute,
since the forms of that sphere are immediately posited for themselves
only as determinacies, as finite in general. But the infinite is accepted
unqualifiedly as absolute, since it is explicitly determined as the negation
61 “Tt goes away or ceases to be” = vergeht. I am using both expressions to retain Hegel’s play on words
in this whole passage.
Existence 109
of the finite; the restrictedness — to which being and becoming would
somehow be susceptible even if they do not have it or exhibit it — is thereby
both explicitly referred to and denied in it.
But, in fact, by just this negation the infinite is not already free from
restrictedness and finitude. It is essential to distinguish the true concept
of infinity from bad infinity, the infinite of reason from the infinite of the
understanding. The latter is in fact a fimitized infinite, and, as we shall now
discover, in wanting to maintain the infinite pure and distant from the
finite, the infinite is by that very fact only made finite.
The infinite
(a) in simple determination, is the affirmative as negation of the finite;
(b) but is thereby in alternating determination with the infinite, and is
abstract, one-sided infinite;
(c) is the self-sublation of this infinite and of the finite in one process. This
is the true infinite.
a. The infinite in general
The infinite is the negation of negation, the affirmative, being that has
reinstated itself out of restrictedness. The infinite zs, in a more intense
sense than the first immediate being; it is the true being; the elevation
above restriction. At the mention of the infinite, soul and spirit Light up,
for in the infinite the spirit zs at home, and not only abstractly; rather, it
rises to itself, to the light of its thinking, its universality, its freedom.
What is first given with the concept of the infinite is this, that in its
being-in-itself existence is determined as finite and transcends restriction.
It is the very nature of the finite that it transcend itself, that it negate its
negation and become infinite. Consequently, the infinite does not stand
above the finite as something ready-made by itself, as if the finite stood fixed
outside or below it. Nor is it we only, as a subjective reason, who transcend
the finite into the infinite — as if, in saying that the infinite is a concept of
reason and that through reason we elevate ourselves above things temporal,
we did this without prejudice to the finite, without this elevation (which
remains external to the finite) affecting it. In so far as the finite itself is
being elevated to infinity, it is not at all an alien force that does this for it;
it is rather its nature to refer itself to itself as restriction (both restriction
as such and as ought) and to transcend this restriction, or rather, in this
self-reference, to have negated the restriction and gone above and beyond
it. It is not in the sublation of the finite in general that infinity in general
comes to be, but the finite is rather just this, that through its nature it
21.125
21.126
IIO Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
comes to be itself the infinite. Infinity is its affirmative determination, its
vocation, what it truly is in itself.
The finite has thus vanished into the infinite and what zs, is only the
infinite.
b. Alternating determination of finite and infinite
The infinite zs; in this immediacy it is at the same time the negation of
an other, of the finite. And so, as existent and at the same time as the
non-being of an other, it has fallen back into the category of the something,
of something determinate in general. More precisely: the infinite is the
existence reflected into itself which results from the mediating sublation of
determinateness in general and is consequently posited as existence distinct
from its determinateness; therefore, it has fallen back into the category of
something with a limit. In accordance with this determinateness, the finite
stands over against the infinite as real existence; they thus remain outside
each other, standing in qualitative mutual reference; the immediate being of
the infinite resurrects the being of its negation, of the finite again, which
seemed at first to have vanished into the infinite.
But the infinite and the finite are not in these referential categories only;
the two sides are further determined in addition to being as mere others
to each other. Namely, the finite is restriction posited as restriction; it is
existence posited with the determination that it passes over into what is its
in-itself and becomes infinite. Infinity is the nothing of the finite, the in-itself
that the latter ought to be, but it is this at the same time as reflected within
itself, as realized ought, as only affirmative self-referring being. In infinity
we have the satisfaction that all determinateness, alteration, all restriction
and the ought itself together with it, have vanished, are sublated, and the
nothing of the finite is posited. As this negation of the finite is the beingin-
itself determined which, as negation of negation, is in itself affirmative.
Yet this affirmation is qualitatively immediate self-reference, being, and,
because of this, the affirmative is led back to the category of being that has
the finite confronting it as an other; its negative nature is posited as existent
negation, and hence as first and immediate negation. The infinite is in this
way burdened with the opposition to the finite, and this finite, as an other,
remains a real existence even though in its being-in-itself, in the infinite,
it is at the same time posited as sublated; this infinite is that which is not
finite — a being in the determinateness of negation. Contrasted with the
finite, with the series of existent determinacies, of realities, the infinite is
Existence III
indeterminate emptiness, the beyond of the finite, whose being-in-itself is
not in its existence (which is something determinate).
As thus posited over against the finite, the two connected by the qualitative
mutual reference of others, the infinite is to be called the bad infinite,
the infinite of the understanding, for which it counts as the highest, the
absolute truth. The understanding believes that it has attained satisfaction
in the reconciliation of truth while it is in fact entangled in unreconciled,
unresolved, absolute contradictions. And it is these contradictions, into
which it falls on every side whenever it embarks on the application and
explication of these categories that belong to it, that must make it conscious
of the fact.
This contradiction is present in the very fact that the infinite remains
over against the finite, with the result that there are two determinacies.
There are two worlds, one infinite and one finite, and in their connection
the infinite is only the Zimit of the finite and thus only a determinate, itself
finite infinite.
This contradiction develops its content into more explicit forms. — The
finite is the real existence which persists as such even when it has gone
over into its non-being, the infinite. As we have seen, this infinite has
for its determinateness, over against the finite, only the first, immediate
negation, just as the finite, as negated, has over against this negation
only the meaning of an other and is, therefore, still a something. When,
therefore, the understanding, elevating itself above this finite world, rises
to what is the highest for it, to the infinite, the finite world remains for it
as something on this side here, and, thus posited only above the finite, the
infinite is separated from the finite and, for the same reason, the finite from
the infinite: each is placed in a different location, the finite as existence here,
and the infinite, although the being-in-itself of the finite, there as a beyond,
at a nebulous, inaccessible distance outside which there stands, enduring,
the finite.
As thus separated, they are just as much essentially connected with each
other, through the very negation that divides them. This negation connecting
them — these somethings reflected into themselves — is the common
limit of each over against the other; and that, too, in such a way that each
does not merely have this limit 271 it over against the other, but the negation
is rather the in-itselfness of each; each thus has for itself, in its separation
from the other, the limit in it. But the limit is the first negation; both are
thus limited, finite, in themselves. Yet, as each affirmatively refers itself to
itself, each is also the negation of its limit; each thus immediately repels
the negation from itself as its non-being, and, qualitatively severed from it,
21.127
21.128
21.129
II2 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
posits it as an other being outside it: the finite posits its non-being as this
infinite, and the infinite likewise the finite. It is readily conceded that the
finite passes over into the infinite necessarily (that is, through its determination)
and is thereby elevated to what is its in-itself, for while the finite
is indeed determined as subsistent existence, it is at the same time also a
null zn itself and therefore destined to self-dissolution; whereas the infinite,
although burdened with negation and limit, is equally also determined as
the existent iv-ztse/f, so that this abstraction of self-referring affirmation is
what constitutes its determination, and hence finite existence is not present
in it. But it has been shown that the infinite itself attains affirmative being
only by the mediation of negation, as negation of negation, and that when
its affirmation thus attained is taken as just simple, qualitative being, the
negation contained in it is demoted to simple immediate negation and,
therefore, to determinateness and limit; and these, then, are excluded
from the infinite as contradicting its in-itself; they are posited as not
belonging to it but rather as opposed to its in-itself, as the finite. Since each
is in it and through its determination the positing of its other, the two are
inseparable. But this unity rests hidden in their qualitative otherness; it is
their inner unity, one that lies only at their base.
The manner of the appearance of this unity has thereby been defined.
The unity is posited in existence as a turning over or transition of the
finite into the infinite, and vice-versa; so that the infinite only emerges in
the finite, and the finite in the infinite, the other in the other; that is
to say, each arises in the other independently and immediately, and their
connection is only an external one.
The process of their transition has the following, detailed shape. We
have the finite passing over into the infinite. This passing over appears as
an external doing. In this emptiness beyond the finite, what arises? What is
there of positive in it? On account of the inseparability of the infinite and
the finite (or because this infinite, which stands apart, is itself restricted),
the limit arises. The infinite has vanished and the other, the finite, has
stepped in. But this stepping in of the finite appears as an event external
to the infinite, and the new limit as something that does not arise out of
the infinite itself but is likewise found given. And with this we are back
at the previous determination, which has been sublated in vain. This new
limit, however, is itself only something to be sublated or transcended. And
so there arises again the emptiness, the nothing, in which we find again the
said determination — and so forth to infinity.
We have before us the alternating determination of the finite and the
infinite; the finite is finite only with reference to the ought or the infinite,
Existence 113
and the infinite is only infinite with reference to the finite. The two are
inseparable and at the same time absolutely other with respect to each
other; each has in it the other of itself; each is thus the unity of itself and
its other, and, in its determinateness — not to be what itself and what its
other is — it is existence.
This alternating determination of self-negating and of negating the
negating is what passes as the progress to infinity, which is accepted in
so many shapes and applications as an unsurpassable ultimate at which
thought, having reached this “and so on to infinity,” has usually achieved
its end. — This progress breaks out wherever relative determinations are
pressed to the point of opposition, so that, though in inseparable unity,
each is nevertheless attributed an independent existence over against the
other. This progress is therefore the contradiction which is not resolved but
is rather always pronounced simply as present.
What we have before us is an abstract transcending which remains
incomplete because the transcending itself has not been transcended. Betore
us we have the infinite; of course, this infinite is transcended, for another
limit is posited, but just because of that only a return is instead made back
to the finite. This bad infinite is in itself the same as the perpetual ought;
it is indeed the negation of the finite, but in truth it is unable to free
itself from it; the finite constantly resurfaces in it as its other, since this
infinite only is with reference to the finite, which is its other. The progress
to infinity is therefore only repetitious monotony, the one and the same
tedious alternation of this finite and infinite.
The infinity of the infinite progress remains burdened by the finite as
such, is thereby restricted, and is itself finite. In fact, however, it is thereby
posited as the unity of the finite and the infinite. Only, this unity is not
reflected upon. Yet it alone rouses the finite in the infinite, and the infinite
in the finite; it is, so to speak, the impulse driving the infinite progress. This
progress is the outside of this unity at which representation remains fixated —
fixated at that perennial repetition of one and the same alternation; at the
empty unrest of a progression across the limit towards the infinite which, in
this infinity, finds a new limit but is just as unable to halt at it as it is at the
infinite. This infinite has the rigid determination of a beyond that cannot
be attained, for the very reason that it ought not be attained, since the
determinateness of the beyond, of an existent negation, has not been let go.
In this determination, the infinite has the finite as a #his-side over against it —
a finite that is likewise unable to raise itself up to the infinite just because
it has this determination of an other, that is, of an existence that perennially
regenerates itself in that beyond precisely by being different from it.

c. Affirmative infinity
In this reciprocal determination of the finite and the infinite alternating
back and forth as just indicated, the truth of these two is already implicitly
present in itself, and all that is needed is to take up what is there. This back
and forth movement constitutes the external realization of the concept in
which the content of the latter is posited, but externally, as a falling out of
the two; all that is needed is the comparing of these two different moments
in which the unity is given which the concept itself gives. “Unity of the
finite and the infinite” — as has often been already noted but must especially
be kept in mind at this juncture — is the uneven expression for the unity as
it is in truth; but also the removal of this uneven determination must be
found in the externalization of the concept that lies ahead of us.
Taken in their first, only immediate determination, the infinite is the
transcending of the finite; according to its determination, it is the negation
of the finite; the finite, for its part, is only that which must be transcended,
the negation in it of itself, and this is the infinite. /7 each, therefore, there is
the determinateness of the other, whereas, according to the viewpoint of the
infinite progression, the two should be mutually excluded and would have
to follow one another only alternately; neither can be posited and grasped
without the other, the infinite without the finite, the finite without the
infinite. In saying what the infinite is, namely the negation of the frite,
the finite itself is sazd also; it cannot be avoided in the determination
of the infinite. One need only know what is being said in order to find
the determination of the finite in the infinite. Regarding the finite, it
is readily conceded that it is the null; this very nothingness is however
the infinite from which it is inseparable. — Understood in this way, they
may seem to be taken according to the way each refers to its other. Taken
without this connecting reference, and thus joined only through an “and,”
they subsist independently, each only an existent over against the other.
We have to examine how they would be constituted in this way. The
infinite, thus positioned, is one of the two; but, as only one of them, it
is itself finite, it is not the whole but only one side; it has its limit in
that which stands over against it; and so it is the finite infinite. We have
before us only two finites. The finitude of the infinite, and therefore its
unity with the finite, lies in the very fact that it is separated from the finite
and placed, consequently, oz one side. — The finite, for its part, removed
from the infinite and positioned for itself, is this self-reference in which the
relativity, its dependence and transitoriness, are removed; it is the same
self-subsistence and self-affırmation which the infinite is presumed to be.
Existence IIS
The two pathways of consideration, even though they seem at first to
have each a different determinateness for their point of departure — the
former inasmuch as it assumes it to be only the reference of infinite and
finite to each other, of each to the other; and the latter their complete
separation from each other — yield one and the same result. The infinite
and the finite, taken together as referring to each other in a connection
which is presumed external but is in fact essential to them (for without it,
neither is what it is), each contains its other in its own determination, just
as, when each is taken for itself, when looked at on its terms, each has the
other present in it as its own moment.
This yields, then, the scandalous unity of the finite and the infinite —
the unity which is itself the infinite that embraces both itself and the
finite — the infinite, therefore, understood in a sense other than when the
finite is separated from it and placed on the other side from it. Since they
must now also be distinguished, each is within it, as just shown, itself
the unity of both; there are thus two such unities. The common element,
the unity of both determinacies, as such a unity, posits them at first as
negated, for each is to be what it is in being distinguished; in their unity,
therefore, they lose their qualitative nature — an important reflection for
countering the incorrigible habit of representing the infinite and the finite,
in their unity, as still holding on to the quality that they would have when
taken apart from each other; of seeing in that unity, therefore, nothing
except contradiction, and not also the resolution of the contradiction by
the negation of the qualitative determinateness of each. And so is the unity
of the infinite and the finite, at first simple and universal, falsified.
But further, since the two are now to be taken also as distinguished, the
unity of the infinite which is itself both of these moments is determined
differently in each. The infinite, determined as such, has in it the finitude
which is distinct from it; in this unity, the infinite is the in-itself while the
finite is only determinateness, the limit in the infinite. But such a limit is
the absolute other of the infinite, its opposite. The infinite’s determination,
which is the in-itself as such, is corrupted by being saddled with a quality
of this sort; the infinite is thus a fznitized infinite. Likewise, since the finite
is as such only the non-in-itself but equally has its opposite in it by virtue
of the said unity, it is elevated above its worth and, so to speak, infinitely
elevated; it is posited as the infinitized finite.
Likewise, just as the simple unity of infinite and finite was falsified before
by the understanding, so too is the double unity. Here also this happens
because the infinite is taken in one of the two unities not as negated but,
rather, as the in-itself in which, therefore, determinateness and restriction
21.132
21.133
21.134
116 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
should not be posited, for they would debase and corrupt it. Conversely,
the finite is equally held fixed as not negated, although null in itself; so
that, in combination with the infinite, it is elevated to what it zs not and is
thereby infinitized notwithstanding its determination that has not vanished
but is rather perpetuated.
The falsification that the understanding perpetrates with respect to the
finite and the infinite, of holding their reciprocal reference fixed as qualitative
differentiation, of maintaining that their determination is separate,
indeed, absolutely separate, comes from forgetting what for the understanding
itself is the concept of these moments. According to this concept,
the unity of the finite and the infinite is not an external bringing together of
them, nor an incongruous combination that goes against their nature, one
in which inherently separate and opposed terms that exist independently
and are consequently incompatible, would be knotted together. Rather,
each is itself this unity, and this only as a sublating of itself in which neither
would have an advantage over the other in in-itselfness and affirmative
existence. As has earlier been shown, finitude is only as a transcending
of itself; it is therefore within it that the infinite, the other of itself, is
contained. Similarly, the infinite is only as the transcending of the finite;
it therefore contains its other essentially, and it is thus within it that it is
the other of itself. The finite is not sublated by the infinite as by a power
present outside it; its infinity consists rather in sublating itself.
This sublating is not, consequently, alteration or otherness in general,
not the sublating of something. That into which the finite is sublated is
the infinite as the negating of finitude. But the latter has long since been
only existence, determined as a non-being. It is only the negation, therefore,
that in the negation sublates itself. Thus infinity is determined on its side
as the negative of the finite and thereby of determinateness in general, as
an empty beyond; its sublating of itself into the finite is a return from an
empty flight, the negation of the beyond which is inherently a negative.
Present in both, therefore, is the same negation of negation. But this
negation of negation is in itself self-reference, affirmation but as turning
back to itself, that is, through the mediation that the negation of negation is.
These are the determinations that it is essential to bring to view; the second
point, however, is that in the infinite progression they are also posited, and
how they are posited therein, namely, not in their ultimate truth.
First, both are negated in that progression, the infinite as well as the finite;
both are equally transcended. Second, they are also posited as distinct, one
after the other, each positive for itself. We sort out these two determinations
while comparing them, just as in the comparison (in an external comparing)
Existence 117
we have separated the two ways of considering them: the finite and the
infinite as referring to one another, and each taken for itself. The infinite
progression, however, says more than this. Also posited in it, though at
first still only as transition and alternation, is the connectedness of the terms
being distinguished. We now only need to see, in one simple reflection,
what is in fact present in it.
In the first place, the negation of the finite and the infinite which is
posited in the infinite progression can be taken as simple, and hence as
mutual externality, only a following of one upon the other. Starting from
the finite, the limit is thus transcended, the finite negated. We now have
its beyond, the infinite, but in this the limit rises up again; so we have the
transcending of the infinite. This twofold sublation is nonetheless partly
only an external event and an alternating of moments in general, and partly
still not posited as one unity; each of these moves beyond is an independent
starting point, a fresh act, so that the two fall apart. — But, in addition, their
connection is also present in the infinite progression. The finite comes first;
then there is the transcending of it, and this negative, or this beyond of the
finite, is the infinite; third, this negation is transcended in turn, a new limit
comes up, a finite again. — This is the complete, self-closing movement that
has arrived at that which made the beginning; what emerges is the same as
that from which the departure was made, that is, the finite is restored; the
latter has therefore rejoined itself, in its beyond has only found itself again.
The same is the case regarding the infinite. In the infinite, in the beyond
of the limit, only a new limit arises which has the same fate, namely, that
as finite it must be negated. Thus what is again at hand is the same infinite
that just now disappeared in the new limit; by being sublated, by traversing
the new limit, the infinite has not therefore advanced one jot further: it
has distanced itself neither from the finite (for the finite is just this, to pass
over into the infinite), nor from itself, for it has arrived at itself.
Thus the finite and the infinite are both this movement of each returning
to itself through its negation; they are only as implicit mediation, and the
affirmative of each contains the negative of each, and is the negation of the
negation. — They are thus a result and, as such, not in the determination
that they had at the beginning: neither is the finite an existence on its side
nor the infinite an existence or a being-in-itself beyond that existence, that
is, beyond existence in the determination of finitude. The understanding
strongly resists the unity of the finite and the infinite only because it presupposes
restriction and finitude to remain, like being-in-itself, constants.
It thereby overlooks the negation of both which is in fact present in the
infinite progression, just as it equally overlooks that the two occur in this
21.135
21.136
118 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
progression only as moments of a whole — that each emerges only through
the mediation of its opposite but, essentially, equally by means of the
sublation of its opposite.
If this immanent turning back has for the moment been reckoned to
be just as much the turning back of the finite to itself and of the infinite
to itself, noticeable in this very result is an error connected with the onesidedness
just criticized: the finite and then the infinite is each taken as
the starting point, and only in this way two results ensue. But it is a matter
of total indifference which is taken as the starting point and, with this,
the distinction caused by the duality of results dissolves of itself. This is
likewise posited in the line of the infinite progression, open-ended on both
sides, wherein each of the moments recurs in equal alternation, and it is
totally extraneous at which position the progression is arrested and taken
as beginning. — The moments are distinguished in the progression but each
is equally only moment of the other. Since both, the finite and the infinite,
are themselves moments of the progress, they are jointly the finite, and,
since they are equally jointly negated in it and in the result, this result as
the negation of their joint finitude is called with truth the infinite. Their
distinction is thus the double meaning which they both have. The finite has
the double meaning, first, of being the finite over against the infinite which
stands over against it, and, second, of being at the same time the finite
and the infinite over against the infinite. Also the infinite has the double
meaning of being ove of the two moments (it is then the bad infinite)
and of being the infinite in which the two moments, itself and its other,
are only moments. Therefore, as in fact we now have it, the nature of the
infinite is that it is the process in which it lowers itself to be only one of its
determinations over against the finite and therefore itself only one of the
finites, and elevates this distinction of itself and itself to be self-affirmation
and, through this mediation, the true infinite.
This determination of the true infinite cannot be captured in the already
criticized formula of a unity of the finite and the infinite; unity is abstract,
motionless self-sameness, and the moments are likewise unmoved beings.
But, like both its moments, the infinite is rather essentially only as becoming,
though a becoming now further determined in its moments. Becoming has
for its determinations, first, abstract being and nothing; as alteration, it has
existence, something and other; now as infinite, it has finite and infinite,
these two themselves as in becoming.
This infinite, as being-turned-back-unto-itself, as reference of itself
to itself, is being — but not indeterminate, abstract being, for it is
posited as negating the negation; consequently, it is also existence or
Existence II9
*thereness,"? for it contains negation in general and consequently determinateness.
It zs, and is there, present, before us. Only the bad infinite is
the beyond, since it is only the negation of the finite posited as rez/ and,
as such, it is abstract first negation; thus determined only as negative, it
does not have the affirmation of existence in it; held fast only as something
negative, it ought not to be there, it ought to be unattainable. However, to
be thus unattainable is not its grandeur but rather its defect, which is at
bottom the result of holding fast to the finite as such, as existent. It is the
untrue which is the unattainable, and what must be recognized is that such
an infinite is the untrue. — The image of the progression in infinity is the
straight /ine; the infinite is only at the two limits of this line, and always
only is where the latter (which is existence) is not but transcends itself, in
its non-existence, that is, in the indeterminate. As true infinite, bent back
upon itself, its image becomes the circle, the line that has reached itself,
closed and wholly present, without beginning and end.
True infinity, thus taken in general as existence posited as affirmative in
contrast to abstract negation, is reality in a higher sense than it was earlier
as simply determined; it has now obtained a concrete content. It is not
the finite which is the real, but rather the infinite. Thus reality is further
determined as essence, concept, idea, and so forth. In connection with the
more concrete, it is however superfluous to repeat such earlier and more
abstract categories as reality, and to use them for determinations more
concrete than they are by themselves. Such a repetition, as when it is said
that essence, or that the concept, is real, has its origin in the fact that to
uneducated thought the most abstract categories such as being, existence,
reality, finitude, are the most familiar.
The more immediate occasion, however, for recalling here the categories
of reality is that the negation, against which reality is the affirmative, is here
the negation of negation, and consequently itself posited over against that
reality which finite existence is. — Negation is thus determined as ideality;
the idealized" is the finite as it is in the true infinite — as a determination, a
content, a distinct but not a subsistent existent, a moment rather. Ideality has
this more concrete signification which is not fully expressed through the
negation of finite existence. — As regards reality and ideality, the opposition
The ideal [das Ideale) has a broader meaning (such as of the beautiful and its associations) than
the idealized [das Ideelle]. The former does not belong here yet, and for this reason the expression
idealized is being used. There is no such distinction made in language usage for “reality”; in German
reelle and reale are used as roughly synonymous and no interest is served in nuancing the two in
some sort of opposition.

21.137
21.138
120 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
of finite and infinite is, however, so grasped that the finite assumes the value
of “the real,” whereas the infinite that of “the idealized”; in the same way,
further on, also the concept is regarded as an idealization, that is, as a mere
idealization, in contrast to existence in general, which is regarded as “the
real.” When contrasted in this way, it is of course of no use to have reserved
for the said concrete determination of negation the distinctive expression
of “idealization”; in that opposition of finite and infinite, we are back to
the one-sidedness of the abstract negative characteristic of the bad infinite
and still fixed in the affirmative existence of the finite.
Transition
Ideality can be called the guality of the infinite; but it is essentially the
process of becoming, and hence a transition — like the transition of becoming
into existence. We must now explicate this transition. This immanent
turning back, as the sublating of finitude — that is, of finitude as such
and equally of the negative finitude that only stands opposite to it, is only
negative finitude — is self-reference, being. Since there is negation in this
being, the latter is existence; but, further, since the negation is essentially
negation of the negation, self-referring negation, it is the existence that
carries the name of being-for-itself.
Remark 1
The infinite — in the usual sense of the bad infinite — and the progression to
infinity, such as the ought, are the expression of a contradiction that pretends
to be itself a solution and an ultimate. This infinite is a first elevation of
sense representation above the finite to thought, but to a thought which, for
content, has only a nothing, that is, a non-existent explicitly posited as such:
it is a flight beyond restrictions that fails to gather itself together within
and is unable to bring the negative back to the positive. This unfulfilled
reflection has before it both the determinations of the true infinite (namely
the opposition of the finite and the infinite, and the wzity of the finite
and the infinite) but fails to bring the two thoughts together; the thought
of one unavoidably brings the other along, but this reflection lets them
only alternate. The spectacle of this alternation, this infinite progression,
occurs wherever one remains fixated on the contradiction of the unity of
two determinations and of their opposition. The finite is the sublation of
itself; it holds its negation, the infinity, in itself: ty of the two. It is the
movement beyond the finite into the infinite as the beyond of the finite:
separation of the two. But over and beyond the infinite there is another
finite; the beyond, the infinite, holds finitude: unity of the two. But this
Existence 121
finite is also a negative of the infinite: separation of the two, and so forth. —
Thus, in the relation of causality, cause and effect are inseparable; a cause
that would have no effect is not a cause, just as an effect that had no
cause would no longer be effect. This relation yields, therefore, the infinite
progression of causes and effects; something is determined as cause, but,
as something finite (and it is finite just because of its separation from the
effect), it has itself a cause, that is, it is also effect; consequently, the same
thing that was determined as cause is also determined as effect (unity of
cause and effect); what is now determined as effect has in turn a cause,
that is, the cause is to be separated from its effect and to be posited as a
different something; this new cause is however itself only an effect (unity
of cause and effect); it has an other for its cause; separation of the two
determinations, and so forth, into infinity.
We can thus restate the progression in this more appropriate form. The
claim is made that the finite and the infinite are one unity. This is a false
claim that needs correction by its opposite: the two are absolutely different
and opposed. This claim is in turn to be corrected to the effect that the
two are inseparable; that in the one determination there lies the other by
virtue of the claim to unity; and so forth to infinity. — It is easy enough
to see into the nature of the infinite: one must recognize that the infinite
progression, the developed infinity of the understanding, is constituted by
the alternation of the two determinations, of the unity and the separation
of the two moments; and then further recognize that this unity and this
separation are inseparable.
The resolution of this contradiction is not the acknowledgment of the
equal correctness, and of the equal incorrectness, of both claims — this would
only be another shape of the still abiding contradiction — but the ideality of
both, in the sense that in their distinction, as reciprocal negations, they are
only moments. That monotonous alternation of the infinite progression
is in fact the negation of both their zzity and their separation. What was
demonstrated above is just as much present in it de facto: namely, that
the finite, over and beyond itself, falls into the infinite, but that, over and
beyond this infinite, it equally finds itself born anew; hence, that it rejoins
itself there, as is also the case for the infinite — so that this same negation
of negation results in affirmation, a result that thereby proves itself to be
their truth and point of origin. In this being which is thus the ideality
of the distinct moments, the contradiction has not vanished abstractly,
but is resolved and reconciled, and the thoughts, while left intact, are
65 i.e. by abstracting from the differences that give rise to the contradiction.

also brought together. Here we have, in a graphic example, the nature of
speculative thought displayed in its determining feature: it consists solely in
grasping the opposed moments in their unity. Inasmuch as each moment
shows, as a matter of fact, that it has its opposite in it, and that in this
Opposite it rejoins itself, the affirmative truth is this internally self-moving
unity, the grasping together of both thoughts, their infinity — the reference
to oneself which is not immediate but infinite.
The essence of philosophy has often been located by those already adept
in the things of thought in the task of answering the question: How does the
infinite go forth out of itself and come to finitude? — This, as opinion would
have it, escapes conceptual comprehension. In the course of this exposition,
the infinite at whose concept we have arrived will further determine itself,
and the desideratum — how the infinite (if one can so express oneself) comes
to finitude — will be manifested in it in the full manifold of forms. Here we
are considering this question only in its immediacy and in view of the just
mentioned sense which the infinite usually carries.
It is above all on the answer to this question that whether there is a philosophy
is taken to depend, and people believe, while still professing willingness
to let the matter rest on it, that they also possess in the question itself a sort of
puzzle, an invincible talisman, that firmly secures them against the answer,
and consequently against philosophy and the attainment of it. In order to
understand questions, a certain education is required also in other subject
matters, and this is all the more the case for things philosophical if more of
an answer is to be had than that the question is an idle one. — It is fair to
expect in these questions, as is normally done, that the point at issue would
not depend on words but would rather be made intelligible through some
form or other of expression. Figurative expressions of sense representation
that are used in the question regarding the infinite, like “going forth” and
suchlike, arouse the suspicion that the question stemmed from the terrain
of vulgar representation, and that the answer is also expected to be in representations
current in everyday life and in the shape of a sensuous simile.
Take being in general, instead of the infinite. The determining of it, its
having a negation or finitude in it, seems easier to comprehend. Being is
indeed the indeterminate, but it is not immediately said in it that it is the
opposite of anything determinate. The infinite, on the contrary, contains
this note expressly; it is the zoz-finite. The unity of the finite and the
infinite thus appears excluded from the start; incomplete reflection is most
stubbornly opposed to this unity for precisely this reason.
But it has been shown, and it is immediately evident without expanding
further on the determination of the finite and the infinite, that the infinite,
Existence 123
in the sense in which it is taken by that incomplete reflection, namely as
standing opposite the finite, has its other in it precisely because it stands
opposed to it, and is therefore already limited and itself finite. It is the
bad infinite. The answer to the question, “how does the infinite become
finite?,” is therefore this: 7 here is not an infinite which is infinite beforehand,
and only afterwards does it find it necessary to become finite, to go forth
into finitude; the infinite is rather for itself just as much finite as infinite.
Inasmuch as the question assumes that the infinite is by itself on the one
side, and that the finite which has gone forth from it (or from wherever it
might have come) into the divide is truly real as thus separated from the
infinite, one should say rather that it is this divide which is conceptually
incomprehensible. Neither such a finite nor such an infinite has truth; that
which has no truth, however, cannot be conceptually grasped. Yet it must
be granted that they are conceptually comprehensible. To consider them
even as they are in representation with the determination of each implicit
in the other; to have a simple insight into this inseparability which is theirs,
means that we comprehend them conceptually. This inseparability is their
concept. — In the self-subsistence of that infinite and finite, the question
sets up a false content instead; it presupposes a false connection between
them. For this reason, the question is not to be answered, but the false
presuppositions contained in it, in effect the question itself, are rather
to be denied. By thus questioning the truth of such finite and infinite,
the standpoint is altered, and this change will turn the embarrassment
which the question was supposed to cause back on the question itself.
To the reflection from which the question originated, our own question
is something new, for that reflecting lacks the speculative interest that
would lead it to ascertain for its own sake, and before it draws connections
between determinations, whether such determinations are anything true
as presupposed. To the extent, however, that the untruth of that abstract
infinite is recognized, and of the finite which is equally supposed to stand
unmoved on its side, there is this to be said of the procession of the finite
out of the infinite: the infinite goes out of itself into the finite because, in
the way it is grasped as abstract unity, it has no truth in it, no standing;
and, conversely, the finite goes forth into the infinite for the same reason.
Or it is rather to be said that the infinite proceeded to finitude from all
eternity; that, just as much as pure being, it absolutely zs not by itself alone,
without having its other zz 11.
The question how the infinite proceeds to the finite can harbor a further
presupposition still, namely that the infinite includes the finite within
itself, and consequently that it is the unity of itself and its other, so that the
21.141
21.142

124 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
difficulty has to do essentially with the separating, for this is in opposition
to the presupposed unity. On this presupposition, the opposition insisted
upon only assumes a different form; the unity and the distinguishing are
separated from each other and held isolated. If, however, the unity is not
taken abstractly and indeterminately, but rather, as in the presupposition,
as the determinate unity of the finite and the infinite, the distinguishing
of these two is also present in it. And this distinguishing is not one that
would also let them go loose, each subsisting separately, but it rather leaves
them in the unity as idealized. This unity of the infinite and the finite, and
the distinguishing of them, are inseparable, in the same way as the finite
and the infinite.
Remark 2
The claim that the finite is an idealization defines idealism. The idealism of
philosophy consists in nothing else than in the recognition that the finite is
not truly an existent. Every philosophy is essentially idealism or at least has
idealism for its principle, and the question then is only how far this principle
is carried out. This applies to philosophy just as much as to religion, for
religion also, no less than philosophy, will not admit finitude as a true being,
an ultimate, an absolute, or as something non-posited, uncreated, eternal.
The opposition between idealistic and realistic philosophy is therefore
without meaning. A philosophy that attributes to finite existence, as such,
true, ultimate, absolute being, does not deserve the name of philosophy.
The principles of ancient as well as more recent philosophies — whether
“water, “matter,” or “atoms” — are universals, idealizations, not things as
given immediately, that is, in sensuous singularity. Not even the “water”
of Thales is that, for, although also empirical water, it is besides that the
in-itself or essence of all other things, and these things do not stand on their
own, self-grounded, but are posited on the basis of an other, of “water,”
that is, they are idealized. In thus calling the principle or the universal an
idealization as we have just done (and the concept, the idea, spirit, deserve
the name even more), and in saying then that the singular things of the
senses are idealizations in principle, or in their concept, and even more so
when sublated in the spirit, we must note, in passing, the same doublesidedness
that transpired in the infinite, namely that an idealization is on
the one hand something concrete, a true existent, but, on the other hand,
that its moments are no less idealizations, sublated in it; in fact, however,
there is only one concrete whole from which the moments are inseparable.
By an idealization is normally meant the form of representation. Whatever
is in any of my representations, whether in the concept, the idea,
Existence 125
the imagination, and so forth, goes by the name of idealization, so that
the “idealized” stands in general also for imaginary constructs — for representations
that are not only distinguished from anything real but should
essentially z0£ be taken as real. In point of fact, spirit is above all the true
idealist; in spirit, even as spirit senses and represents but still more as it
thinks and conceptualizes, the content is not real existence, as so called; in
the simplicity of the I, any such external being is only sublated, it is for
me, it is in me idealized. This subjective idealism, whether it is the unconscious
idealism of consciousness in general or is consciously declared and
installed as principle, extends only to the form of representation according
to which a content is mine. In the systematized idealism of subjectivity,
this form is declared to be the only true form, one that excludes the form
of the objectivity or reality of that content, of its external existence. Such
an idealism is formal, since it does not take into consideration the content
of representation or thought, and therefore does not go past its finitude.
Nothing is lost by this idealism, both because the reality of this finite
content (the existence filled with finitude) is retained, and because, if one
abstracts from it, in itself nothing of much consequence is to be made of
it. Nor is anything gained by it, for the same reason that nothing is lost,
since the “I” remains representation, spirit still filled with the same content
of finitude. The opposition of the forms of subjectivity and objectivity
is of course itself one of finitudes; but the content, as taken up in sensation,
intuition, or also in the more abstract element of representation and
thought, contains such finitudes in full, and these, by the exclusion of that
one mode of finitude alone (of the form of subjective and objective), are
still not done away with, and even less have they fallen off on their own.
