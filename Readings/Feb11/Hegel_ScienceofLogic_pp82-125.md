chapter 2
Existence
Existence is determinate being; its determinateness is existent determinateness,
quality. Through its quality, something is opposed to an other; it is
alterable and finite, negatively determined not only towards an other, but
absolutely within it. This negation in it, in contrast at first with the finite
something, is the infinite; the abstract opposition in which these determinations
appear resolves itself into oppositionless infinity, into being-for-itself.
The treatment of existence is therefore in three divisions:
A. existence as such
B. something and other, finitude
C. qualitative infinity.
a. existence as such
In existence (a) as such, its determinateness is first (b) to be distinguished as
quality. The latter, however, is to be taken in both the two determinations of
existence as reality and negation. In these determinacies, however, existence
is equally reflected into itself, and, as so reflected, it is posited as (c)
something, an existent. 21.97
a. Existence in general
Existence proceeds from becoming. It is the simple oneness of being and
nothing. On account of this simplicity, it has the form of an immediate. Its
mediation, the becoming, lies behind it; it has sublated itself, and existence
therefore appears as a first from which the forward move is made. It is
at first in the one-sided determination of being; the other determination
which it contains, nothing, will likewise come up in it, in contrast to the
first.
It is not mere being but existence, or Dasein [in German]; according to
its [German] etymology, it is being (Sein) in a certain place (da). But the
83
84 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
representation of space does not belong here. As it follows upon becoming,
existence is in general being with a non-being, so that this non-being is taken
up into simple unity with being. Non-being thus taken up into being with
the result that the concrete whole is in the form of being, of immediacy,
constitutes determinateness as such.
The whole is likewise in the form or determinateness of being, since in
becoming being has likewise shown itself to be only a moment – something
sublated, negatively determined. It is such, however, for us, in our reflection;
not yet as posited in it. What is posited, however, is the determinateness as
such of existence, as is also expressed by the da (or “there”) of the Dasein. –
The two are always to be clearly distinguished.Only that which is posited in
a concept belongs in the course of the elaboration of the latter to its content.
Any determinateness not yet posited in the concept itself belongs instead to
our reflection, whether this reflection is directed to the nature of the concept
itself or is a matter of external comparison. To remark on a determinateness
of this last kind can only be for the clarification or anticipation of the whole
that will transpire in the course of the development itself. That the whole,
the unity of being and nothing, is in the one-sided determinateness of being
is an external reflection; but in negation, in something and other, and so
forth, it will become posited. – It was necessary here to call attention to
the distinction just given; but to comment on all that reflection can allow
itself, to give an account of it, would lead to a long-winded anticipation
of what must transpire in the fact itself. Although such reflections may
serve to facilitate a general overview and thus facilitate understanding,
they also bring the disadvantage of being seen as unjustified assertions,
21.98 unjustified grounds and foundations, of what is to follow. They should
be taken for no more than what they are supposed to be and should be
distinguished from what constitutes a moment in the advance of the fact
itself.
Existence corresponds to being in the preceding sphere. But being is the
indeterminate; there are no determinations that therefore transpire in it.
But existence is determinate being, something concrete; consequently, several
determinations, several distinct relations of its moments, immediately
emerge in it.
b. Quality
On account of the immediacy with which being and nothing are one in
existence, neither oversteps the other; to the extent that existence is existent,
to that extent it is non-being; it is determined. Being is not the universal,
Existence 85
determinateness not the particular.42 Determinateness has yet to detach itself
from being; nor will it ever detach itself from it, since the now underlying
truth is the unity of non-being with being; all further determinations will
transpire on this basis. But the connection which determinateness now has
with being is one of the immediate unity of the two, so that as yet no
differentiation between the two is posited.
Determinateness thus isolated by itself, as existent determinateness, is
quality – something totally simple, immediate. Determinateness in general
is the more universal which, further determined, can be something quantitative
as well. On account of this simplicity, there is nothing further to
say about quality as such.
Existence, however, in which nothing and being are equally contained,
is itself the measure of the one-sidedness of quality as an only immediate
or existent determinateness. Quality is equally to be posited in the
determination of nothing, and the result is that the immediate or existent
determinateness is posited as distinct, reflected, and the nothing, as thus
the determinate element of determinateness, will equally be something
reflected, a negation. Quality, in the distinct value of existent, is reality;
when affected by a negating, it is negation in general, still a quality but one
that counts as a lack and is further determined as limit, restriction. 21.99
Both are an existence, but in reality, as quality with the accent on being
an existent, that it is determinateness and hence also negation is concealed;
reality only has, therefore, the value of something positive from which
negating, restriction, lack, are excluded. Negation, for its part, taken as
mere lack, would be what nothing is; but it is an existence, a quality, only
determined with a non-being.
Remark
Reality may seem to be an ambiguous word, since it is used in different,
even opposite determinations. In philosophical usage, for instance, one
speaks of mere empirical reality as of a worthless being. But when it is
said of thoughts, concepts, theories, that they have no reality, this means
that there is no actuality to them. Of the idea of a Platonic republic, for
instance, it is said that it might well be true in itself or in its concept. Here
the idea is not denied its value and is even allowed room alongside reality.
However, as against the so-called mere ideas, the mere concepts, “the real”
counts as alone true. – The sense in which external existence is made the
criterion of the truth of a content is for its part just as one-sided as when
42 This will happen in the Subjective Logic, when the logical object assumes the form of “concept.”
86 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
the idea, the essence, or even inner feeling, is represented as indifferent to
external existence and is even held to be all the more estimable the more
remote it is from reality.
In connection with the term “reality,” mention must be made of the
former metaphysical concept of God that was once made the foundation of
the so-called ontological proof of God’s existence.43 God was defined as the
sum-total of all realities, and of this sum-total it was said that it contained
no contradiction within, that none of the realities canceled any other, for
a reality is to be taken only as a perfection, as something affirmative that
contains no negation. Consequently, as it was said, the realities are not in
opposition and do not contradict one another.
On this concept of reality, the assumption is that the latter still remains
after 21.100 all negation has been thought away; however, to do this is to remove
all determinateness from reality. Reality is quality, existence; it therefore
contains the moment of the negative and is the determinate being that it
is only through it. Taken in the so-called eminent sense, or as infinite in
the ordinary meaning of the word – as we are said we should – reality is
expanded into indeterminateness and loses its meaning. God’s goodness
is supposed to be such not in the ordinary sense but eminently; it is not
different fromjustice but is rather tempered by it (an expression of mediation
of Leibnizian origin)44 just as contrariwise justice is tempered by goodness;
and so neither is goodness goodness any longer, nor justice justice. Power
should be tempered by wisdom – but is then no longer power as such, for
it is subject to wisdom. – Wisdom should be expanded into power, but
then it vanishes as end and measure setting wisdom. The true concept of
the infinite and of its absolute unity that will later emerge45 is not to be
understood as a tempering, a mutual restricting or blending – a superficial,
nebulous connection that can only satisfy mindless representation. – When
reality, taken in the sense of a determinate quality as in the said definition
of God, is made to transgress its determinateness, it ceases to be reality;
it becomes abstract being; God as the pure reality in all realities, or as the
sum-total of all realities, is the same empty absolute, void of determination
and content, in which all is one.
If, on the contrary, reality is taken in its determinateness, then, since
it essentially contains the moment of the negative, the sum-total of all
realities becomes just as much a sum-total of all negations, the sum-total
43 “The most perfect being is defined as one in which all co-possible realities inhere in the absolutely
highest degree.” Christian Wolff, Theologia naturalis methodo scientifica pertractata (Frankfurt and
Leipzig, 1741), §6.

Existence 87
of all contradictions, a sort of first absolute power in which everything
determinate is absorbed.However, since reality only exists in so far as it still
has over against it something which it has not sublated, by being thought
expanded in this way into an accomplished power void of restrictions, it
becomes the abstract nothing. The said reality in everything real, the being
in all existence that should express the concept of God, is nothing else than
abstract being, the same as nothing. 21.101
That determinateness is negation posited as affirmative is Spinoza’s
proposition: omnis determinatio est negatio,46 a proposition of infinite
importance. Only, negation as such is formless abstraction. However, speculative
philosophy must not be accused of taking negation or nothing as an
ultimate: negation is as little an ultimate for it as reality is for it the truth.
The unity of Spinoza’s substance, or that there is only one substance,
is the necessary consequence of this proposition, that determinateness is
negation. Spinoza had of necessity to posit thought and being or extension,
the two determinations, namely, which he had before him, as one in this
unity,47 for as determinate realities the two are negations whose infinity
is their unity;48 according to Spinoza’s definition, about which more later
on,49 the infinity of something is its affirmation. He therefore conceived
them as attributes, that is, such as do not have a particular subsistence,
a being-in-and-for-itself, but only are as sublated as moments; or rather,
since substance is the total void of internal determinateness, they are not
even moments; the attributes, like the modes, are distinctions made by
an external understanding. – Also the substantiality of individuals cannot
hold its own before that substance. The individual refers to itself by setting
limits to every other; but these limits are therefore also the limits of its
self; they are references to the other; the individual’s existence is not in the
individual. True, the individual is more than just restrictions on all sides;
but this more belongs to another sphere, that of the concept; in the metaphysics
of being, the individual is an absolutely determinate something;
and against this something, against this finite that would be in and for
itself as such, determinateness asserts itself essentially as negation, dragging
it into the same negative movement of the understanding that makes
everything vanish into the abstract unity of substance.
Negation stands immediately over against reality; further on, in the
sphere proper to reflected determinations, it will be opposed to the positive, 21.102

88 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
which is reality reflecting upon negation – the reality in which the negative,
still hiding in reality as such, shines forth.50
Quality specifically is a property only when, in an external connection,
it manifests itself as an immanent determination. By properties of herbs,
for instance, we understand determinations which are not just proper to
a something but are such that, in virtue of them, the something holds its
own while referring to others and will not give in to the alien influences
posited in it by them; on the contrary, it imposes its own determinations
in the other – though it does not keep it at a distance. On the other hand,
more stable determinacies such as figure or shape are not called properties,
nor even qualities, for they are thought of as alterable and therefore as not
identical with being.
“Qualierung” or “Inqualierung,” an expression of Jacob Boehme’s profound
but also profoundly turbid philosophy, signifies the movement
within a quality (sourness, bitterness, fieriness, etc.) inasmuch as in its
negative nature (in its Qual or torment) the quality posits itself, securing
itself from another; it signifies in general the internal unrest of quality by
which it produces and preserves itself only in conflict.51
c. Something
In existence its determinateness has been distinguished as quality; in this
quality as something existing, the distinction exists – the distinction of
reality and negation.Nowthough these distinctions are present in existence,
they are just as much null and sublated. Reality itself contains negation; it
is existence, not indeterminate or abstract being. Negation is for its part
equally existence, not the supposed abstract nothing but posited here as it
21.103 is in itself, as existent, as belonging to existence. Thus quality is in general
unseparated from existence, and the latter is only determinate, qualitative
being.
This sublating of the distinction is more than the mere retraction and
external re-omission of it, or a simple return to the simple beginning, to
existence as such. The distinction cannot be left out, for it is. Therefore,
what de facto is at hand is this: existence in general, distinction in it, and the
sublation of this distinction; the existence, not void of distinctions as at the
50 Cf. below 11.273ff.

Aufgang, ed. August Faust and Will-Erich Peuckert (Stuttgart: Fr. Frommanns, 1955), chapter 13,

Existence 89
beginning, but as again self-equal through the sublation of the distinction;
the simplicity of existence mediated through this sublation. This state of
sublation of the distinction is existence’s own determinateness; existence is
thus being-in-itself; it is existent, something.
Something is the first negation of negation, as simple existent selfreference.
Existence, life, thought, and so forth, essentially take on the
determination of an existent being, a living thing, a thinking mind (“I”),
and so forth. This determination is of the highest importance if we do not
wish to halt at existence, life, thought, and so forth, as generalities – also
not at Godhood (instead of God). In common representation, something
rightly carries the connotation of a real thing. Yet it still is a very superficial
determination, just as reality and negation, existence and its determinateness,
though no longer the empty being and nothing, still are quite abstract
determinations. For this reason they also are the most common expressions,
and a reflection that is still philosophically unschooled uses them the most;
it casts its distinctions in them, fancying that in them it has something
really well and firmly determined. – As something, the negative of the negative
is only the beginning of the subject – its in-itselfness is still quite
indeterminate. It determines itself further on, at first as existent-for-itself
and so on, until it finally obtains in the concept the intensity of the subject.
At the base of all these determinations there lies the negative unity
with itself. In all this, however, care must be taken to distinguish the first
negation, negation as negation in general, from the second negation, the
negation of negation which is concrete, absolute negativity, just as the first
is on the contrary only abstract negativity.
Something is an existent as the negation of negation, for such a negation
is the restoration of the simple reference to itself – but the something is
thereby equally the mediation of itself with itself. Present in the simplicity
of something, and then with greater determinateness in being-for-itself, in
the subject, and so forth, this mediation of itself with itself is also already
present in becoming, but only as totally abstract mediation; mediation
with itself is posited in the something in so far as the latter is determined as 21.104
a simple identity. – Attention can be drawn to the presence of mediation
in general, as against the principle of the alleged bare immediacy of a
knowledge from which mediation should be excluded. But there is no
further need to draw particular attention to the moment of mediation,
since it is to be found everywhere and on all sides, in every concept.
This mediation with itself which something is in itself, when taken only
as the negation of negation, has no concrete determinations for its sides;
thus it collapses into the simple unity which is being. Something is, and
90 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
is therefore also an existent. Further, it is in itself also becoming, but a
becoming that no longer has only being and nothing for its moments.
One of these moments, being, is now existence and further an existent.
The other moment is equally an existent, but determined as the negative of
something – an other. As becoming, something is a transition, the moments
of which are themselves something, and for that reason it is an alteration – a
becoming that has already become concrete. – At first, however, something
alters only in its concept; it is not yet posited in this way, as mediated and
mediating, but at first only as maintaining itself simply in its reference to
itself; and its negative is posited as equally qualitative, as only an other in
general.
b. finitude
(a) Something and other: at first they are indifferent to one another; an
other is also an immediate existent, a something; the negation thus falls
outside both. Something is in itself in contrast to its being-for-other.
But the determinateness belongs also to its in-itself, and
(b) the determination of this in-itself in turn passes over into constitution,
and this latter, as identical with determination, constitutes the immanent
and at the same time negated being-for-another, the limit of
something which
(c) is the immanent determination of the something itself, and the something
thus is the finite.
In the first division where existence in general was considered, this existence
had, as at first taken up, the determination of an existent. The
moments of its development, quality and something, are therefore of
equally affirmative determination. The present division, on the contrary,
21.105 develops the negative determination which is present in existence and was
there from the start only as negation in general. It was then the first negation
but has now been determined to the point of the being-in-itself of the
something, the point of the negation of negation.
a. Something and an other
1. Something and other are, first, both existents or something.
Second, each is equally an other. It is indifferent which is named first,
and just for this reason it is named something (in Latin, when they occur
in a proposition, both are aliud, or “the one, the other,” alius alium; in the
case of an alternating relation, the analogous expression is alter alterum).
Existence 91
If of two beings we call the one A and the other B, the B is the one which
is first determined as other. But the A is just as much the other of the
B. Both are other in the same way. “This” serves to fix the distinction
and the something which is to be taken in the affirmative sense. But
“this” also expresses the fact that the distinction, and the privileging of one
something, is a subjective designation that falls outside the something itself.
The whole determinateness falls on the side of this external pointing; also
the expression “this” contains no distinctions; each and every something is
just as good a “this” as any other. By “this” we mean to express something
completely determinate, overlooking the fact that language, as a work of
the understanding, only expresses the universal, albeit naming it as a single
object. But an individual name is something meaningless in the sense that
it does not express a universal. It appears as something merely posited and
arbitrary for the same reason that proper names can also be arbitrarily
picked, arbitrarily given as well as arbitrarily altered.52
Otherness thus appears as a determination alien to the existence thus
pointed at, or the other existence as outside this one existence, partly
because the one existence is determined as other only by being compared
by a Third, and partly because it is so determined only on account of the
other which is outside it, but is not an other for itself. At the same time,
as has been remarked, even for ordinary thinking every existence equally
determines itself as an other existence, so that there is no existence that
remains determined simply as an existence, none which is not outside an
existence and therefore is not itself an other. 21.106
Both are determined as something as well as other: thus they are the
same and there is as yet no distinction present in them. But this sameness of
determinations, too, falls only within external reflection, in the comparison
of the two; but the other, as posited at first, though an other with reference
to something, is other also for itself apart from the something.
Third, the other is therefore to be taken in isolation, with reference to
itself, has to be taken abstractly as the other, the 
 

 of Plato who
opposes it to the one as a moment of totality, and in this way ascribes
to the other a nature of its own. Thus the other, taken solely as such, is
not the other of something, but is the other within, that is, the other of
itself. – Such an other, which is the other by its own determination, is
physical nature; nature is the other of spirit; this, its determination, is at first
a mere relativity expressing not a quality of nature itself but only a reference
external to it. But since spirit is the true something, and hence nature is
52 Hegel is repeating the argument of Chapter 1 of the Phenomenology of Spirit.
92 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
what it is within only in contrast to spirit, taken for itself the quality of
nature is just this, to be the other within, that which-exists-outside-itself (in
the determinations of space, time, matter).
The other which is such for itself is the other within it, hence the other
of itself and so the other of the other – therefore, the absolutely unequal in
itself, that which negates itself, alters itself. But it equally remains identical
with itself, for that into which it alters is the other, and this other has no
additional determination; but that which alters itself is not determined in
any other way than in this, to be an other; in going over to this other, it only
unites with itself. It is thus posited as reflected into itself with sublation of
the otherness, a self-identical something from which the otherness, which is
at the same time a moment of it, is therefore distinct, itself not appertaining
to it as something.
2. The something preserves itself in its non-being; it is essentially one
with it, and essentially not one with it. It therefore stands in reference to
an otherness without being just this otherness. The otherness is at once
contained in it and yet separated from it; it is being-for-other.
Existence as such is an immediate, bare of references; or, it is in the
determination of being. However, as including non-being within itself,
existence is determinate being, being negated within itself, and then in the
first instance an other – but, since in being negated it preserves itself at the
21.107 same time, it is only being-for-other.
It preserves itself in its non-being and is being; not, however, being
in general but being with reference to itself in contrast to its reference
to the other, as self-equality in contrast to its inequality. Such a being is
being-in-itself.
Being-for-other and being-in-itself constitute the two moments of something.
There are here two pairs of determinations: (1) something and
other; (2) being-for-other and being-in-itself. The former contain the nonconnectedness
of their determinateness; something and other fall apart.
But their truth is their connection; being-for-other and being-in-itself are
therefore the same determinations posited as moments of one and the same
unity, as determinations which are connections and which, in their unity,
remain in the unity of existence. Each thus itself contains within it, at the
same time, also the moment diverse from it.
Being and nothing in their unity, which is existence, are no longer
being and nothing (these they are only outside their unity); so in their
restless unity, in becoming, they are coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be. – In
the something, being is being-in-itself. Now, as self-reference, self-equality,
being is no longer immediately, but is self-reference only as the non-being
Existence 93
of otherness (as existence reflected into itself ). – The same goes for nonbeing:
as the moment of something in this unity of being and non-being:
it is not non-existence in general but is the other, and more determinedly –
according as being is at the same time distinguished from it – it is reference
to its non-existence, being-for-other.
Hence being-in-itself is, first, negative reference to non-existence; it has
otherness outside it and is opposed to it; in so far as something is in itself,
it is withdrawn from being-other and being-for-other. But, second, it has
non-being also right in it; for it is itself the non-being of being-for-other. 21.108
But being-for-other is, first, the negation of the simple reference of being
to itself which, in the first place, is supposed to be existence and something;
in so far as something is in an other or for an other, it lacks a being of
its own. But, second, it is not non-existence as pure nothing; it is nonexistence
that points to being-in-itself as its being reflected into itself, just
as conversely the being-in-itself points to being-for-other.
3. Both moments are determinations of one and the same, namely of
something. Something is in-itself in so far as it has returned from the
being-for-other back to itself. But something has also a determination or
circumstance, whether in itself (here the accent is on the in) or in it; in so
far as this circumstance is in it externally, it is a being-for-other.
This leads to a further determination. Being-in-itself and being-for-other
are different at first. But that something also has in it what it is in itself and
conversely is in itself also what it is as being-for-other – this is the identity of
being-in-itself and being-for-other, in accordance with the determination
that the something is itself one and the same something of both moments,
and these are in it, therefore, undivided. – This identity already occurs
formally in the sphere of existence, but more explicitly in the treatment of
essence and later of the relations of interiority and externality, and in the
most determinate form in the treatment of the idea, as the unity of concept
and actuality. – Opinion has it that with the in-itself something lofty is
being said, as with the inner; but what something is only in itself, is also only
in it; in-itself is a merely abstract, and hence itself external determination.
The expressions: there is nothing in it, or there is something in it, imply,
though somewhat obscurely, that what is in a thing also pertains to its
in-itselfness, to its inner, true worth.
Itmay be observed that here we have the meaning of the thing-in-itself.
It is a very simple abstraction, though it was for a while a very important
determination, something sophisticated, as it were, just as the proposition
that we know nothing of what things are in themselves was a much valued 21.109
piece of wisdom. – Things are called “in-themselves” in so far as abstraction
94 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
is made from all being-for-other, which really means, in so far as they are
thought without all determination, as nothing. In this sense, of course, it
is impossible to know what the thing-in-itself is. For the question “what?”
calls for determinations to be produced; but since the things of which the
determinations are called for are at the same time presumed to be things-inthemselves,
which means precisely without determination, the impossibility
of an answer is thoughtlessly implanted in the question, or else a senseless
answer is given. – The thing-in-itself is the same as that absolute of which
nothing is known except that in it all is one. What there is in these thingsin-
themselves is therefore very well known; they are as such nothing but
empty abstractions void of truth. What, however, the thing-in-itself in
truth is, what there basically is in it, of this the Logic is the exposition.
But in this Logic something better is understood by the in-itself than an
abstraction, namely, what something is in its concept; but this concept is
in itself concrete: as concept, in principle conceptually graspable; and, as
determined and as the connected whole of its determinations, inherently
cognizable.
Being-in-itself has at first the being-for-other as a moment standing
over against it. But positedness also comes to be positioned over against
it, and, although in this expression being-for-other is also included, the
expression still contains the determination of the bending back, which
has already occurred, of that which is not in itself into that wherein it is
positive, and this is its being-in-itself. Being-in-itself is normally to be taken
as an abstract way of expressing the concept; positing, strictly speaking, first
occurs in the sphere of essence, of objective reflection; the ground posits
that which is grounded through it; more strongly, the cause produces an
effect, an existence whose subsistence is immediately negated and which
carries the meaning that it has its substance, its being, in an other. In the
sphere of being, existence only emerges out of becoming. Or again, with
the something an other is posited; with the finite, an infinite; but the finite
does not bring forth the infinite, does not posit it. In the sphere of being,
the self-determining of the concept is at first only in itself or implicit, and
for that reason it is called a transition or passing over. And the reflecting
determinations of being, such as something and other, or finite and infinite,
although they essentially point to one another, or are as being-for-other,
also stand on their own qualitatively; the other exists; the finite, like the
infinite, is equally to be regarded as an immediate existent that stands firm
21.110 on its own; the meaning of each appears complete even without its other.
The positive and the negative, on the contrary, cause and effect, however
much they are taken in isolation, have at the same time no meaning each
Existence 95
without the other; their reflective shining in each other, the shine in each of
its other, is present right in them. – In the different cycles of determination
and especially in the progress of the exposition, or, more precisely, in the
progress of the concept in the exposition of itself, it is of capital concern
always to clearly distinguish what still is in itself or implicitly and what is
posited, how determinations are in the concept and how they are as posited
or as existing-for-other. This is a distinction that belongs only to the
dialectical development and one unknown to metaphysical philosophizing
(to which the critical also belongs); the definitions of metaphysics, like
its presuppositions, distinctions, and conclusions, are meant to assert and
produce only the existent and that, too, as existent-in-itself.
In the unity of the something with itself, being-for-other is identical with
its in-itself; the being-for-other is thus in the something. The determinateness
thus reflected into itself is therefore again a simple existent and hence
again a quality – determination.
b. Determination,53 constitution, and limit
The in-itself, in which the something is reflected into itself from its beingfor-
other, no longer is an abstract in-itself but, as the negation of its
being-for-other, is mediated through this latter, which is thus its moment.
It is not only the immediate identity of the something with itself, but
the identity by virtue of which the something also has present in it what
it is in itself; the being-for-other is present in it because the in-itself is the
sublation of it, is in itself from it; but, because it is still abstract, and therefore
essentially affected with negation, it is equally affected with being-for-other.
We have here not only quality and reality, existent determinateness, but
determinateness existent-in-itself; and the development consists in positing
such determinateness as thus immanently reflected.
1. The quality which in the simple something is an in-itself essentially in
unity with the something’s other moment, its being-in-it, can be named its
determination, provided that this word is distinguished, in a more precise
signification, from determinateness in general. Determination is affirmative
determinateness; it is the in-itself by which a something abides in its
existence while involved with an other that would determine it, by which
it preserves itself in its self-equality, holding on to it in its being-for- 21.111
other. Something fulfills its determination to the extent that the further
53 Bestimmung also carries the meaning of “vocation” or “destiny” as in “die Bestimmung des Menschen,”
the vocation of humankind.
96 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
determinateness, which variously accrues to it in the measure of its beingin-
itself as it relates to an other, becomes its filling. Determination implies
that what something is in itself is also present in it.
The determination of the human being, its vocation, is rational thought:
thinking in general is his simple determinateness; by it the human being
is distinguished from the brute; he is thinking in himself, in so far as
this thinking is distinguished also from his being-for-other, from his own
natural and sensuous being that brings him in immediate association with
the other. But thinking is also in him; the human being is himself thinking,
he exists as thinking, thought is his concrete existence and actuality; and,
further, since thinking is in his existence and his existence is in his thinking,
thinking is concrete, must be taken as having content and filling; it is rational
thought and as such the determination of the human being. But even this
determination is again only in itself, as an ought, that is to say, it is, together
with the filling embodied in its in-itself, in the form of an in-itself in general
as against the existence which is not embodied in it but still lies outside
confronting it, immediate sensibility and nature.
2. The filling of the being-in-itself with determinateness is also distinct
from the determinateness which is only being-for-other and remains
outside the determination. For in the sphere of the qualitative, the distinguished
terms are left, in their sublated being, also with an immediate,
qualitative being contrasting them. That which the something has in it
thus separates itself and is from this side the external existence of the something
and also its existence, but not as belonging to its being-in-itself. –
Determinateness is thus constitution.
Constituted in this or that way, the something is caught up in external
influences and in external relationships. This external connection on which
the constitution depends, and the being determined through an other,
appear as something accidental. But it is the quality of the something to
be given over to this externality and to have a constitution.
In so far as something alters, the alteration falls on the side of its con-
21.112 stitution; the latter is that in the something which becomes an other. The
something itself preserves itself in the alteration; the latter affects only this
unstable surface of the something’s otherness, not its determination.
Determination and constitution are thus distinct from each other; something,
according to its determination, is indifferent to its constitution.
But that which the something has in it is the middle term of this syllogism
connecting the two, determination and constitution. Or, rather, the
being-in-the-something showed itself to fall apart into these two extremes.
The simple middle term is determinateness as such; its identity belongs to
Existence 97
determination just as well as to constitution. But determination passes over
into constitution on its own, and constitution into determination. This
is implied in what has been said. The connection, upon closer consideration,
is this: in so far as that which something is in itself is also in it,
the something is affected with being-for-other; determination is therefore
open, as such, to the relation with other. Determinateness is at the same
time moment, but it contains at the same time the qualitative distinction
of being different from being-in-itself, of being the negative of the something,
another existence. This determinateness which thus holds the other
in itself, united with the being-in-itself, introduces otherness in the latter or
in determination, and determination is thereby reduced to constitution. –
Conversely, the being-for-other, isolated as constitution and posited on its
own, is in it the same as what the other as such is, the other in it, that is,
the other of itself; but it consequently is self-referring existence, thus beingin-
itself with a determinateness, therefore determination. – Consequently,
inasmuch as the two are also to be held apart, constitution, which appears
to be grounded in something external, in an other in general, also depends
on determination, and the determining from outside is at the same time
determined by the something’s own immanent determination. And further,
constitution belongs to that which something is in itself: something
alters along with its constitution.
This altering of something is no longer the first alteration of something
merely in accordance with its being-for-other. The first was an alteration
only implicitly present, one that belonged to the inner concept; now the
alteration is also posited in the something. – The something itself is further
determined, and negation is posited as immanent to it, as its developed
being-in-itself. 21.113
The transition of determination and constitution into each other is at
first the sublation of their distinction, and existence or something in general
is thereby posited; moreover, since this something in general results from a
distinction that also includes qualitative otherness within it, there are two
somethings. But these are, with respect to each other, not just others in
general, so that this negation would still be abstract and would occur only
in the comparison of the two; rather the negation now is immanent to the
somethings. As existing, they are indifferent to each other, but this, their
affirmation, is no longer immediate: each refers itself to itself through the
intermediary of the sublation of the otherness which in determination is
reflected into the in-itselfness.
Something behaves in this way in relation to the other through itself;
since otherness is posited in it as its own moment, its in-itselfness holds
98 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
negation in itself, and it now has its affirmative existence through its
intermediary alone. But the other is also qualitatively distinguished from
this affirmative existence and is thus posited outside the something. The
negation of its other is only the quality of the something, for it is in
this sublation of its other that it is something. The other, for its part,
truly confronts an existence only with this sublation; it confronts the first
something only externally, or, since the two are in fact inherently joined
together, that is, according to their concept, their connectedness consists
in this, that existence has passed over into otherness, something into other;
that something is just as much an other as the other is. Now in so far as the
in-itselfness is the non-being of the otherness that is contained in it but
is at the same time also distinct as existent, something is itself negation,
the ceasing to be of an other in it; it is posited as behaving negatively in
relation to the other and in so doing preserving itself. This other, the initselfness
of the something as negation of the negation, is the something’s
being-in-itself, and this sublation is as simple negation at the same time in
it, namely, as its negation of the other something external to it. It is one
determinateness of the two somethings that, on the one hand, as negation
of the negation, is identical with the in-itselfness of the somethings,
and also, on the other hand, since these negations are to each other as
other somethings, joins them together of their own accord and, since each
negation negates the other, equally separates them. This determinateness is
limit.
3. Being-for-other is indeterminate, affirmative association of something
with its other; in limit the non-being-for-other is emphasized, the qualitative
negation of the other, which is thereby kept out of the something
that is reflected into itself. We must see the development of this concept –
a development that will rather look like confusion and contradiction.
Contradiction immediately raises its head because limit, as an internally
reflected negation of something, ideally holds in it the moments of something
and other, and these, as distinct moments, are at the same time
posited in the sphere of existence as really, qualitatively, distinct.
21.114 . Something is therefore immediate, self-referring existence and at first
it has a limit with respect to an other; limit is the non-being of the other,
not of the something itself; in limit, something marks the boundary of its
other. – But other is itself a something in general. The limit that something
has with respect to an other is, therefore, also the limit of the other as a
something; it is the limit of this something in virtue of which the something
holds the first something as its other away from itself, or is a non-being of
that something. The limit is thus not only the non-being of the other, but of
Existence 99
the one something just as of the other, and consequently of the something
in general.
But the limit is equally, essentially, the non-being of the other; thus,
through its limit, something at the same time is. In limiting, something
is of course thereby reduced to being limited itself; but, as the ceasing of
the other in it, its limit is at the same time itself only the being of the
something; this something is what it is by virtue of it, has its quality in it. –
This relation is the external appearance of the fact that limit is simple
negation or the first negation, whereas the other is, at the same time, the
negation of the negation, the in-itselfness of the something.
Something, as an immediate existence, is therefore the limit with respect
to another something; but it has this limit in it and is something through
the mediation of that limit, which is just as much its non-being. The limit
is the mediation in virtue of which something and other each both is and
is not.
. Now in so far as something in its limit both is and is not, and these
moments are an immediate, qualitative distinction, the non-existence and
the existence of the something fall outside each other. Something has its
existence outside its limit (or, as representation would also have it, inside it);
in the same way the other, too, since it is something, has it outside it. The
limit is the middle point between the two at which they leave off. They have
existence beyond each other, beyond their limit; the limit, as the non-being
of each, is the other of both.
– It is in accordance with this difference of the something from its limit
that the line appears as line outside its limit, the point; the plane as plane
outside the line; the solid as solid only outside its limiting plane. – This
is the aspect of limit that first occurs to figurative representation (the selfexternal-
being of the concept) and is also most commonly assumed in the
context of spatial objects.
. But further, something as it is outside the limit, as the unlimited
something, is only existence in general. As such, it is not distinguished
from its other; it is only existence and, therefore, it and its other have the 21.115
same determination; each is only something in general or each is other;
and so both are the same. But this, their at first immediate existence, is now
posited in them as limit: in it both are what they are, distinct from each
other. But it is also equally their common distinguishedness, the unity and
the distinguishedness of both, just like existence. This double identity of
the two, existence and limit, contains this: that something has existence
only in limit, and that, since limit and immediate existence are each at the
same time the negative of each other, the something, which is now only
100 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
in its limit, equally separates itself from itself, points beyond itself to its
non-being and declares it to be its being, and so it passes over into it. To
apply this to the preceding example, the one determination is this: that
something is what it is only in its limit. Therefore, the point is the limit of
line, not because the latter just ceases at the point and has existence outside
it; the line is the limit of plane, not because the plane just ceases at it; and
the same goes for the plane as the limit of solid. Rather, at the point the line
also begins; the point is its absolute beginning, and if the line is represented
as unlimited on both its two sides, or, as is said, as extended to infinity, the
point still constitutes its element, just as the line constitutes the element
of the plane, and the plane that of the solid. These limits are the principle
of that which they delimit; just as one, for instance, is as hundredth the
limit, but also the element, of the whole hundred.
The other determination is the unrest of the something in its limit in
which it is immanent, the contradiction that propels it beyond itself. Thus
the point is this dialectic of itself becoming line; the line, the dialectic of
becoming plane; the plane, of becoming total space. A second definition
is given of line, plane, and whole space which has the line come to be
through the movement of the point; the plane through the movement of
the line, and so forth. This movement of the point, the line, and so forth, is
however viewed as something accidental, or as movement only in figurative
representation. In fact, however, this view is taken back by supposing that
the determinations from which the line, and so forth, originate are their
elements and principles, and these are, at the same time, nothing else but
their limits; the coming to be is not considered as accidental or only as
represented. That the point, the line, the plane, are per se self-contradictory
beginnings which on their own repel themselves from themselves, and
consequently that the point passes over from itself into the line through
21.116 its concept, moves in itself and makes the line come to be, and so on – all
this lies in the concept of the limit which is immanent in the something.
The application itself, however, belongs to the treatment of space; as an
indication of it here, we can say that the point is the totally abstract limit,
but in a determinate existence; this existence is still taken in total abstraction,
it is the so-called absolute, that is, abstract space, the absolutely continuous
being-outside-one-another. Inasmuch as the limit is not abstract negation,
but is rather in this existence, inasmuch as it is spatial determinateness, the
point is spatial, is the contradiction of abstract negation and continuity
and is, for that reason, the transition as it occurs and has already occurred
into the line, and so forth. And so there is no point, just as there is no line
or plane.
Existence 101
The something, posited with its immanent limit as the contradiction of
itself by virtue of which it is directed and driven out and beyond itself, is
the finite.
c. Finitude
Existence is determinate. Something has a quality, and in this quality it is
not only determined but delimited; its quality is its limit and, affected by it,
something remains affirmative, quiescent existence. But, so developed that
the opposition of its existence and of the negation as the limit immanent to
this existence is the very in-itselfness of the something, and this is thus only
becoming in it, this negation constitutes the finitude of the something.
When we say of things that they are finite, we understand by this that
they not only have a determinateness, that their quality is not only reality
and existent determination, that they are not merely limited and as such
still have existence outside their limit, but rather that non-being constitutes
their nature, their being. Finite things are, but in their reference to
themselves they refer to themselves negatively – in this very self-reference
they propel themselves beyond themselves, beyond their being. They are,
but the truth of this being is (as in Latin) their finis, their end.54 The finite
does not just alter, as the something in general does, but perishes, and its
perishing is not just a mere possibility, as if it might be without perishing.
Rather, the being as such of finite things is to have the germ of this
transgression55 in their in-itselfness: the hour of their birth is the hour of
their death. 21.117
. The immediacy of finitude
The thought of the finitude of things brings this mournful note with it
because finitude is qualitative negation driven to the extreme, and in the
simplicity of such a determination there is no longer left to things an
affirmative being distinct from their determination as things destined to
ruin.56 Because of this qualitative simplicity of negation that has returned
to the abstract opposition of nothing and perishing to being, finitude
is the most obstinate of the categories of the understanding; negation in
54 “ . . . (as in Latin) their finis . . .” is my gloss. The Latin root of “finite” and “finitude” is finis, that
is, “end.” This connection between “finite” and “end” is clear in the German, endlich, Endlichkeit,
Ende, and Hegel plays on it. I have tried to bring out this wordplay, which in English implicates
the Latin word.
55 Vergehen has the meaning of both “offence” (as in “transgression”) and “passage of time.”
56 Bestimmung zum Untergange. Bestimmung means both “determination” and “destiny” or “vocation.”
102 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
general, constitution, limit, are compatible with their other, with existence;
even the abstract nothing, by itself, is given up as an abstraction; but
finitude is negation fixed in itself and, as such, stands in stark contrast to its
affirmative. The finite thus does indeed let itself be submitted to flux; this
is precisely what it is, that it should come to an end, and this end is its only
determination. Its refusal is rather to let itself be brought affirmatively to its
affirmative, the infinite, to be associated with it; it is therefore inseparably
posited with its nothing, and thereby cut off from any reconciliation with
its other, the affirmative. The determination of finite things does not go
past their end. The understanding persists in this sorrow of finitude, for
it makes non-being the determination of things and, at the same time,
this non-being imperishable and absolute. Their transitoriness would only
pass away in their other, in the affirmative; their finitude would then be
severed from them; but this finitude is their unalterable quality, that is,
their quality which does not pass over into their other, that is, not into the
affirmative; and so finitude is eternal.
This is a very important consideration. But that the finite is absolute is
certainly not a standpoint that any philosophy or outlook, or the understanding,
would want to endorse. The opposite is rather expressly present
in the assertion of finitude: the finite is the restricted, the perishable, the
finite is only the finite, not the imperishable; all this is immediately part
and parcel of its determination and expression. But all depends on whether
in one’s view of finitude its being is insisted on, and the transitoriness thus
persists, or whether the transitoriness and the perishing perish. The fact is
that this perishing of the perishing does not happen on precisely the view
that would make the perishing the final end of the finite. The official claim
is that the finite is incompatible with the infinite and cannot be united
with it; that the finite is absolutely opposed to the infinite. Being, absolute
being, is ascribed to the infinite. The finite remains held fast over against it
as its negative; incapable of union with the infinite, it remains absolute on
21.118 its own side; from the affirmative, from the infinite, it would receive affirmation
and thus it would perish; but a union with the infinite is precisely
what is declared impossible. If the finite were not to persist over against
the infinite but were to perish, its perishing, as just said, would then be
the last of it – not its affirmative, which would be only a perishing of the
perishing. However, if it is not to perish into the affirmative but its end
is rather to be grasped as a nothing, then we are back at that first, abstract
nothing that itself has long since passed away.
With this nothing, however, which is supposed to be only nothing
but to which a reflective existence is nevertheless granted in thought, in
Existence 103
representation or in speech, the same contradiction occurs as we have
just indicated in connection with the finite, except that in the nothing
it just occurs but in the finite it is instead expressed. In the one case, the
contradiction appears as subjective; in the other, the finite is said to stand
in perpetual opposition to the infinite, in itself to be null, and to be as null
in itself. This is now to be brought to consciousness. The development
of the finite will show that, expressly as this contradiction, it collapses
internally, but that, in this collapse, it actually resolves the contradiction; it
will show that the finite is not just perishable, and that it perishes, but that
the perishing, the nothing, is rather not the last of it; that the perishing
rather perishes.
. Restriction and the ought
This contradiction is indeed abstractly present by the very fact that the
something is finite, or that the finite is. But something or being is no longer
posited abstractly but reflected into itself, and developed as being-in-itself
that has determination and constitution in it, or, more determinedly still,
in such a way that it has a limit within it; and this limit, as constituting
what is immanent to the something and the quality of its being-in-itself,
is finitude. It is to be seen what moments are contained in this concept of
the finite something.
Determination and constitution arose as sides for external reflection,
but determination already contained otherness as belonging to the in-itself
of something. On the one side, the externality of otherness is within the
something’s own inwardness; on the other side, it remains as otherness
distinguished from it; it is still externality as such, but in the something.
But further, since otherness is determined as limit, itself as negation of 21.119
the negation, the otherness immanent to the something is posited as the
connection of the two sides, and the unity of the something with itself (to
which both determination and constitution belong) is its reference turned
back upon itself, the reference to it of its implicitly existing determination
that in it negates its immanent limit. The self-identical in-itself thus refers
itself to itself as to its own non-being, but as negation of the negation, as
negating that which at the same time retains existence in it, for it is the
quality of its in-itselfness. Something’s own limit, thus posited by it as a
negative which is at the same time essential, is not only limit as such, but
restriction. But restriction is not alone in being posited as negative; the
negation cuts two ways, for that which it posits as negated is limit, and
limit is in general what is common to something and other, and is also
104 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
the determinateness of the in-itself of determination as such. This in-itself,
consequently, as negative reference to its limit (which is also distinguished
from it), as negative reference to itself as restriction, is the ought.
In order for the limit that is in every something to be a restriction, the
something must at the same time transcend it in itself – must refer to it
from within as to a non-existent. The existence of something lies quietly
indifferent, as it were, alongside its limit. But the something transcends
its limit only in so far as it is the sublatedness of the limit, the negative
in-itselfness over against it. And inasmuch as the limit is as restriction in
the determination itself, the something thereby transcends itself.
The ought therefore contains the double determination: once, as a determination
which has an in-itselfness over against negation; and again, as a
non-being which, as restriction, is distinguished from the determination
but is at the same time itself a determination existing in itself.57
The finite has thus determined itself as connecting determination and
limit; in this connection, the determination is the ought and the limit is the
restriction. Thus the two are both moments of the finite, and therefore both
themselves finite, the ought as well as the restriction. But only restriction is
posited as the finite; the ought is restricted only in itself, and therefore only
for us. 21.120 It is restricted by virtue of its reference to the limit already immanent
within it, though this restriction in it is shrouded in in-itselfness, for
according to its determinate being, that is, according to its determinateness
in contrast to restriction, it is posited as being-in-itself.
What ought to be is, and at the same time is not. If it were, it would
not be what merely ought to be. The ought has therefore a restriction
essentially. This restriction is not anything alien; that which only ought to
be is determination now posited as it is in fact, namely as at the same time
only a determinateness.
The being-in-itself of the something is thus reduced in its determination
to the ought because the very thing that constitutes the something’s initselfness
is, in one and the same respect, as non-being; or again, because
in the in-itselfness, in the negation of the negation, the said being-in-itself
is as one negation (what negates) a unity with the other, and this other, as
qualitatively other, is the limit by virtue of which that unity is as reference
57 Hegel is making a deflationary move here. The “ought” is nothing special. It defines explicitly the
true relation that obtains between any subject and its predicate. The subject is its predicate while
at the same time being distinguished from it. The relation between the two is therefore always one
of identity but at a distance. The predicate is what the subject is “destined” or “said” to be. It is
important to keep in mind that Bestimmung in German means both, “determination” and “destiny”
or “vocation.”
Existence 105
to it.58 The restriction of the finite is not anything external, but the finite’s
own determination is rather also its restriction; and this restriction is both
itself and the ought; it is that which is common to both, or rather that in
which the two are identical.
But further, as “ought” the finite transcends its restriction; the same
determinateness which is its negation is also sublated, and is thus its initself;
its limit is also not its limit.
As ought something is thus elevated above its restriction, but conversely
it has its restriction only as ought. The two are indivisible. Something has
a restriction in so far as it has negation in its determination, and the
determination is also the being sublated of the restriction.
Remark
The ought has of late played a major role in philosophy, especially in
connection with morality but also in metaphysics in general, as the final
and absolute concept of the identity of the in-itself or of self-reference, and
of determinateness or the limit. 21.121
“You can because you ought.”59 This expression, which is supposed to
say a lot, is implied in the concept of the ought. For the ought is the
transcendence of restriction; restriction is sublated in it, the in-itself of the
ought is thus identical self-reference, and consequently the abstraction of
“being able.” – But, conversely, “you cannot, even though you ought” is just
as correct. For the restriction as restriction is equally implied in the ought;
the one formalism of possibility has in it a reality, a qualitative otherness,
that stands opposed to it, and the connection of each to the other is a
contradiction, and thus a “cannot” or rather an impossibility.
In the ought the transcendence of finitude, infinity, begins. The ought
is that which, in the subsequent development, in accordance with the said
impossibility, will display itself as a progress to infinity.
Regarding the form of restriction and of the ought, two prejudices deserve
more detailed criticism. First, much is commonly made of the restrictions of
thought, of reason, and so forth, and the claim is made that it is impossible
58 This is a very convoluted sentence. Hegel’s point seems to be this. A subject is reflectively what it is
by negating that its predicate (otherwise qualitatively other than it) is truly an other. The subject is
that predicate as other; it negates the predicate as a would-be other (i.e. as a negative with respect
to it). The subject is therefore reflectively what the predicate is qualitatively (i.e. immediately). It is
what the predicate is, but at a distance as it were. Its self-identity (the negation of the negation that
constitutes its internal being) is thus modified by carrying a reference to the would-be, qualitatively
independent predicate. The latter is what the subject ought to be, what it is “destined” or “said” to
be.
59 Cf. A807/B835.
106 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
to transcend such restrictions. What is lost track of in this claim is that
something is already transcended by the very fact of being determined as a
restriction. For a determinateness, a limit, is determined as restriction only
in opposition to its other in general, that is, in opposition to that which
is without its restriction; the other of a restriction is precisely the beyond
with respect to it. Stone, metal, do not transcend their restriction, for the
simple reason that the restriction is not a restriction for them. However,
with respect to such general propositions that are typical of the way the
understanding thinks, as that it is impossible to transcend restriction, if
thought will not apply itself to see what is implied in the concept, it can
then be referred to actuality, where the propositions prove themselves to be
completely unrealistic. Just because thought ought to be something higher
than actuality, just because it ought to dwell in higher regions remote from
it, and therefore be itself determined as an ought, it fails on the one hand
to advance to the concept, and on the other hand it manages to be equally
untrue both in its relation to actuality and to the concept. – Because a stone
does not think, does not even feel, its determinateness is not a restriction
for it, that is, it is not in it a negation for the sensation, the representation,
the thought, and so on, which it does not have. But the stone too is as a
something distinguished in its determination or its in-itself and existence,
and to this extent it too transcends its restriction; the concept which the
21.122 stone is in itself contains the identity with its other. If it is a base receptive
to acids then it is oxidizable, neutralizable, and so on. In the process of
oxidization, neutralization, and so on, its restriction to being only a base is
sublated; the base transcends it; similarly, the acid transcends its restriction
to being an acid, and in the acid just as in the caustic base the ought, the
imperative to transcend their restriction, is so strong that it is only with
violence that they can be kept fixed as acid and caustic base (as waterless,
that is, purely non-neutral).
If, however, a concrete existence contains the concept not merely as
abstract in-itselfness, but as a totality existing for itself, as instinct, life, sensation,
representation, and so forth, it itself then brings about, by itself, this
transcendence and this transcending. The plant transcends the restriction
of being a seed, similarly, of being blossom, fruit, leaf; the seed becomes
the developed plant, the blossom fades, and so forth. In the grip of hunger,
thirst, and so forth, the sentient is the impulse to transcend this restriction,
and it does transcend it. It feels pain, and to feel pain is the privilege of
sentient nature. Pain is a negation within the sentient’s self, and this negation
is determined as a restriction in the sentient’s feeling just because the
sentient has a feeling of its self, and this self is the totality that transcends
Existence 107
the determinateness of the negation. If the sentient did not transcend it,
it would not feel it as its negation and would have no pain. – But reason,
thought, is not supposed to be able to transcend this restriction: reason,
which is the universal, which is for itself the beyond of particularity as
such, that is, of all particularity, only is the transcendence of restriction. –
To be sure, not every transcending, not every transcendence beyond restriction,
is a true liberation from it, a true affirmation; even the “ought” itself
is this kind of imperfect transcending, and so abstraction in general. But
the mention of a totally abstract universal is sufficient to counter the
equally abstract pronouncement that restriction cannot be transcended,
or, again, the mention of the infinite in general is sufficient to counter the
pronouncement that the finite cannot be transcended.
We can recall in this context a seemingly ingenious notion of Leibniz:
that if a magnet had consciousness, it would regard its pointing to theNorth
as a determination of its will, a law of its freedom.60 Rather, if the magnet
did have consciousness and along with it a will and freedom, it would be a
thinking being. Consequently, space would be for it a universal embracing
all directions, and its one direction to the North thus a restriction rather
of its freedom – just as being held fixed to one place is a restriction for a
human being, but not for a plant. 21.123
The ought, for its part, is the transcending of restriction, but a transcendingwhich
is itself only finite. It therefore has its place and legitimacy in the
field of finitude, where it holds in-itself fixed over against what is restricted,
declaring it to be the norm and the essential relative to what is null. Duty
is an ought directed against the particular will, against self-seeking desire
and arbitrary interest; it is the ought held up before a will capable of isolating
itself from the truth because of its instability. Those who hold the
ought of morality so high as to believe that, by not recognizing it as the
ultimate truth, morality itself would be destroyed; the brokers of reason
whose understanding takes unceasing satisfaction in being able to confront
everything that there is with an ought and consequently a would-be superior
knowledge – who therefore are all the more resistant to being robbed
of the ought – these do not see that, as regards the finitude of their sphere,
the ought receives full recognition. – But in the actual order of things,
reason and law are not in such a sad state of affairs that they only ought
to be (only the abstraction of the in-itself stays at this); equally, the ought
does not perpetuate itself nor, which is the same, is finitude absolute. The
philosophy of Kant and Fichte holds out the ought as the resolution of
60 Leibniz, Theodicy (1710), Part 1, §50.
108 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
the contradictions of reason – though it is rather only a standpoint that
remains fixed in finitude and therefore in contradiction.
. Transition of the finite into the infinite
The ought contains restriction explicitly, for itself, and restriction contains
the ought. Their mutual connection is the finite itself, which contains them
both in its in-itself. These moments of its determination are qualitatively
opposed; restriction is determined as the negative of the ought, and the
ought equally as the negative of restriction. The finite is thus in itself the
contradiction of itself; it sublates itself, it goes away and ceases to be.61
But this, its result, the negative as such, is () its very determination; for
it is the negative of the negative. So, in going away and ceasing to be,
the finite has not ceased; it has only become momentarily an other finite
which equally is, however, a going-away as a going-over into another finite,
and so forth to infinity. But, () if we consider this result more closely, in
its going-away and ceasing-to-be, in this negation of itself, the finite has
attained its being-in-itself; in it, it has rejoined itself. Each of its moments
contains precisely this result; the ought transcends the restriction, that is,
it transcends itself; but its beyond, or its other, is only restriction itself.
Restriction, for its part, immediately points beyond itself to its other, and
21.124 this is the ought; but this ought is the same diremption of in-itselfness and
determinateness as is restriction; it is the same thing; in going beyond itself,
restriction thus equally rejoins itself. This identity with itself, the negation
of negation, is affirmative being, is thus the other of the finite which is
supposed to have the first negation for its determinateness; this other is the
infinite.
c. infinity
The infinite in its simple concept can be regarded, first of all, as a fresh
definition of the absolute; as self-reference devoid of determination, it is
posited as being and becoming. The forms of existence have no place in the
series of determinations that can be regarded as definitions of the absolute,
since the forms of that sphere are immediately posited for themselves
only as determinacies, as finite in general. But the infinite is accepted
unqualifiedly as absolute, since it is explicitly determined as the negation
61 “It goes away or ceases to be” = vergeht. I am using both expressions to retain Hegel’s play on words
in this whole passage.
Existence 109
of the finite; the restrictedness – to which being and becoming would
somehow be susceptible even if they do not have it or exhibit it – is thereby
both explicitly referred to and denied in it.
But, in fact, by just this negation the infinite is not already free from
restrictedness and finitude. It is essential to distinguish the true concept
of infinity from bad infinity, the infinite of reason from the infinite of the
understanding. The latter is in fact a finitized infinite, and, as we shall now
discover, in wanting to maintain the infinite pure and distant from the
finite, the infinite is by that very fact only made finite.
The infinite
(a) in simple determination, is the affirmative as negation of the finite;
(b) but is thereby in alternating determination with the infinite, and is
abstract, one-sided infinite;
(c) is the self-sublation of this infinite and of the finite in one process. This
is the true infinite. 21.125
a. The infinite in general
The infinite is the negation of negation, the affirmative, being that has
reinstated itself out of restrictedness. The infinite is, in a more intense
sense than the first immediate being; it is the true being; the elevation
above restriction. At the mention of the infinite, soul and spirit light up,
for in the infinite the spirit is at home, and not only abstractly; rather, it
rises to itself, to the light of its thinking, its universality, its freedom.
What is first given with the concept of the infinite is this, that in its
being-in-itself existence is determined as finite and transcends restriction.
It is the very nature of the finite that it transcend itself, that it negate its
negation and become infinite. Consequently, the infinite does not stand
above the finite as something ready-made by itself, as if the finite stood fixed
outside or below it. Nor is it we only, as a subjective reason, who transcend
the finite into the infinite – as if, in saying that the infinite is a concept of
reason and that through reason we elevate ourselves above things temporal,
we did this without prejudice to the finite, without this elevation (which
remains external to the finite) affecting it. In so far as the finite itself is
being elevated to infinity, it is not at all an alien force that does this for it;
it is rather its nature to refer itself to itself as restriction (both restriction
as such and as ought) and to transcend this restriction, or rather, in this
self-reference, to have negated the restriction and gone above and beyond
it. It is not in the sublation of the finite in general that infinity in general
comes to be, but the finite is rather just this, that through its nature it
110 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
comes to be itself the infinite. Infinity is its affirmative determination, its
vocation, what it truly is in itself.
The finite has thus vanished into the infinite and what is, is only the
21.126 infinite.
b. Alternating determination of finite and infinite
The infinite is; in this immediacy it is at the same time the negation of
an other, of the finite. And so, as existent and at the same time as the
non-being of an other, it has fallen back into the category of the something,
of something determinate in general. More precisely: the infinite is the
existence reflected into itself which results from the mediating sublation of
determinateness in general and is consequently posited as existence distinct
from its determinateness; therefore, it has fallen back into the category of
something with a limit. In accordance with this determinateness, the finite
stands over against the infinite as real existence; they thus remain outside
each other, standing in qualitative mutual reference; the immediate being of
the infinite resurrects the being of its negation, of the finite again, which
seemed at first to have vanished into the infinite.
But the infinite and the finite are not in these referential categories only;
the two sides are further determined in addition to being as mere others
to each other. Namely, the finite is restriction posited as restriction; it is
existence posited with the determination that it passes over into what is its
in-itself and becomes infinite. Infinity is the nothing of the finite, the in-itself
that the latter ought to be, but it is this at the same time as reflected within
itself, as realized ought, as only affirmative self-referring being. In infinity
we have the satisfaction that all determinateness, alteration, all restriction
and the ought itself together with it, have vanished, are sublated, and the
nothing of the finite is posited. As this negation of the finite is the beingin-
itself determined which, as negation of negation, is in itself affirmative.
Yet this affirmation is qualitatively immediate self-reference, being; and,
because of this, the affirmative is led back to the category of being that has
the finite confronting it as an other; its negative nature is posited as existent
negation, and hence as first and immediate negation. The infinite is in this
way burdened with the opposition to the finite, and this finite, as an other,
remains a real existence even though in its being-in-itself, in the infinite,
it is at the same time posited as sublated; this infinite is that which is not
finite – a being in the determinateness of negation. Contrasted with the
finite, with the series of existent determinacies, of realities, the infinite is
Existence 111
indeterminate emptiness, the beyond of the finite, whose being-in-itself is
not in its existence (which is something determinate). 21.127
As thus posited over against the finite, the two connected by the qualitative
mutual reference of others, the infinite is to be called the bad infinite,
the infinite of the understanding, for which it counts as the highest, the
absolute truth. The understanding believes that it has attained satisfaction
in the reconciliation of truth while it is in fact entangled in unreconciled,
unresolved, absolute contradictions. And it is these contradictions, into
which it falls on every side whenever it embarks on the application and
explication of these categories that belong to it, that must make it conscious
of the fact.
This contradiction is present in the very fact that the infinite remains
over against the finite, with the result that there are two determinacies.
There are two worlds, one infinite and one finite, and in their connection
the infinite is only the limit of the finite and thus only a determinate, itself
finite infinite.
This contradiction develops its content into more explicit forms. – The
finite is the real existence which persists as such even when it has gone
over into its non-being, the infinite. As we have seen, this infinite has
for its determinateness, over against the finite, only the first, immediate
negation, just as the finite, as negated, has over against this negation
only the meaning of an other and is, therefore, still a something. When,
therefore, the understanding, elevating itself above this finite world, rises
to what is the highest for it, to the infinite, the finite world remains for it
as something on this side here, and, thus posited only above the finite, the
infinite is separated from the finite and, for the same reason, the finite from
the infinite: each is placed in a different location, the finite as existence here,
and the infinite, although the being-in-itself of the finite, there as a beyond,
at a nebulous, inaccessible distance outside which there stands, enduring,
the finite.
As thus separated, they are just as much essentially connected with each
other, through the very negation that divides them. This negation connecting
them – these somethings reflected into themselves – is the common
limit of each over against the other; and that, too, in such a way that each
does not merely have this limit in it over against the other, but the negation
is rather the in-itselfness of each; each thus has for itself, in its separation
from the other, the limit in it. But the limit is the first negation; both are
thus limited, finite, in themselves. Yet, as each affirmatively refers itself to
itself, each is also the negation of its limit; each thus immediately repels
the negation from itself as its non-being, and, qualitatively severed from it, 21.128
112 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
posits it as an other being outside it: the finite posits its non-being as this
infinite, and the infinite likewise the finite. It is readily conceded that the
finite passes over into the infinite necessarily (that is, through its determination)
and is thereby elevated to what is its in-itself, for while the finite
is indeed determined as subsistent existence, it is at the same time also a
null in itself and therefore destined to self-dissolution; whereas the infinite,
although burdened with negation and limit, is equally also determined as
the existent in-itself, so that this abstraction of self-referring affirmation is
what constitutes its determination, and hence finite existence is not present
in it. But it has been shown that the infinite itself attains affirmative being
only by the mediation of negation, as negation of negation, and that when
its affirmation thus attained is taken as just simple, qualitative being, the
negation contained in it is demoted to simple immediate negation and,
therefore, to determinateness and limit; and these, then, are excluded
from the infinite as contradicting its in-itself; they are posited as not
belonging to it but rather as opposed to its in-itself, as the finite. Since each
is in it and through its determination the positing of its other, the two are
inseparable. But this unity rests hidden in their qualitative otherness; it is
their inner unity, one that lies only at their base.
The manner of the appearance of this unity has thereby been defined.
The unity is posited in existence as a turning over or transition of the
finite into the infinite, and vice-versa; so that the infinite only emerges in
the finite, and the finite in the infinite, the other in the other; that is
to say, each arises in the other independently and immediately, and their
connection is only an external one.
The process of their transition has the following, detailed shape. We
have the finite passing over into the infinite. This passing over appears as
an external doing. In this emptiness beyond the finite, what arises? What is
there of positive in it? On account of the inseparability of the infinite and
the finite (or because this infinite, which stands apart, is itself restricted),
the limit arises. The infinite has vanished and the other, the finite, has
stepped in. But this stepping in of the finite appears as an event external
21.129 to the infinite, and the new limit as something that does not arise out of
the infinite itself but is likewise found given. And with this we are back
at the previous determination, which has been sublated in vain. This new
limit, however, is itself only something to be sublated or transcended. And
so there arises again the emptiness, the nothing, in which we find again the
said determination – and so forth to infinity.
We have before us the alternating determination of the finite and the
infinite; the finite is finite only with reference to the ought or the infinite,
Existence 113
and the infinite is only infinite with reference to the finite. The two are
inseparable and at the same time absolutely other with respect to each
other; each has in it the other of itself; each is thus the unity of itself and
its other, and, in its determinateness – not to be what itself and what its
other is – it is existence.
This alternating determination of self-negating and of negating the
negating is what passes as the progress to infinity, which is accepted in
so many shapes and applications as an unsurpassable ultimate at which
thought, having reached this “and so on to infinity,” has usually achieved
its end. – This progress breaks out wherever relative determinations are
pressed to the point of opposition, so that, though in inseparable unity,
each is nevertheless attributed an independent existence over against the
other. This progress is therefore the contradiction which is not resolved but
is rather always pronounced simply as present.
What we have before us is an abstract transcending which remains
incomplete because the transcending itself has not been transcended. Before
us we have the infinite; of course, this infinite is transcended, for another
limit is posited, but just because of that only a return is instead made back
to the finite. This bad infinite is in itself the same as the perpetual ought;
it is indeed the negation of the finite, but in truth it is unable to free
itself from it; the finite constantly resurfaces in it as its other, since this
infinite only is with reference to the finite, which is its other. The progress
to infinity is therefore only repetitious monotony, the one and the same
tedious alternation of this finite and infinite. 21.130
The infinity of the infinite progress remains burdened by the finite as
such, is thereby restricted, and is itself finite. In fact, however, it is thereby
posited as the unity of the finite and the infinite. Only, this unity is not
reflected upon. Yet it alone rouses the finite in the infinite, and the infinite
in the finite; it is, so to speak, the impulse driving the infinite progress. This
progress is the outside of this unity at which representation remains fixated –
fixated at that perennial repetition of one and the same alternation; at the
empty unrest of a progression across the limit towards the infinite which, in
this infinity, finds a new limit but is just as unable to halt at it as it is at the
infinite. This infinite has the rigid determination of a beyond that cannot
be attained, for the very reason that it ought not be attained, since the
determinateness of the beyond, of an existent negation, has not been let go.
In this determination, the infinite has the finite as a this-side over against it –
a finite that is likewise unable to raise itself up to the infinite just because
it has this determination of an other, that is, of an existence that perennially
regenerates itself in that beyond precisely by being different from it.
114 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
c. Affirmative infinity
In this reciprocal determination of the finite and the infinite alternating
back and forth as just indicated, the truth of these two is already implicitly
present in itself, and all that is needed is to take up what is there. This back
and forth movement constitutes the external realization of the concept in
which the content of the latter is posited, but externally, as a falling out of
21.131 the two; all that is needed is the comparing of these two different moments
in which the unity is given which the concept itself gives. “Unity of the
finite and the infinite” – as has often been already noted but must especially
be kept in mind at this juncture – is the uneven expression for the unity as
it is in truth; but also the removal of this uneven determination must be
found in the externalization of the concept that lies ahead of us.
Taken in their first, only immediate determination, the infinite is the
transcending of the finite; according to its determination, it is the negation
of the finite; the finite, for its part, is only that which must be transcended,
the negation in it of itself, and this is the infinite. In each, therefore, there is
the determinateness of the other, whereas, according to the viewpoint of the
infinite progression, the two should be mutually excluded and would have
to follow one another only alternately; neither can be posited and grasped
without the other, the infinite without the finite, the finite without the
infinite. In saying what the infinite is, namely the negation of the finite,
the finite itself is said also; it cannot be avoided in the determination
of the infinite. One need only know what is being said in order to find
the determination of the finite in the infinite. Regarding the finite, it
is readily conceded that it is the null; this very nothingness is however
the infinite from which it is inseparable. – Understood in this way, they
may seem to be taken according to the way each refers to its other. Taken
without this connecting reference, and thus joined only through an “and,”
they subsist independently, each only an existent over against the other.
We have to examine how they would be constituted in this way. The
infinite, thus positioned, is one of the two; but, as only one of them, it
is itself finite, it is not the whole but only one side; it has its limit in
that which stands over against it; and so it is the finite infinite. We have
before us only two finites. The finitude of the infinite, and therefore its
unity with the finite, lies in the very fact that it is separated from the finite
and placed, consequently, on one side. – The finite, for its part, removed
from the infinite and positioned for itself, is this self-reference in which the
relativity, its dependence and transitoriness, are removed; it is the same
self-subsistence and self-affirmation which the infinite is presumed to be.
Existence 115
The two pathways of consideration, even though they seem at first to
have each a different determinateness for their point of departure – the
former inasmuch as it assumes it to be only the reference of infinite and
finite to each other, of each to the other; and the latter their complete
separation from each other – yield one and the same result. The infinite 21.132
and the finite, taken together as referring to each other in a connection
which is presumed external but is in fact essential to them (for without it,
neither is what it is), each contains its other in its own determination, just
as, when each is taken for itself, when looked at on its terms, each has the
other present in it as its own moment.
This yields, then, the scandalous unity of the finite and the infinite –
the unity which is itself the infinite that embraces both itself and the
finite – the infinite, therefore, understood in a sense other than when the
finite is separated from it and placed on the other side from it. Since they
must now also be distinguished, each is within it, as just shown, itself
the unity of both; there are thus two such unities. The common element,
the unity of both determinacies, as such a unity, posits them at first as
negated, for each is to be what it is in being distinguished; in their unity,
therefore, they lose their qualitative nature – an important reflection for
countering the incorrigible habit of representing the infinite and the finite,
in their unity, as still holding on to the quality that they would have when
taken apart from each other; of seeing in that unity, therefore, nothing
except contradiction, and not also the resolution of the contradiction by
the negation of the qualitative determinateness of each. And so is the unity
of the infinite and the finite, at first simple and universal, falsified.
But further, since the two are now to be taken also as distinguished, the
unity of the infinite which is itself both of these moments is determined
differently in each. The infinite, determined as such, has in it the finitude
which is distinct from it; in this unity, the infinite is the in-itself while the
finite is only determinateness, the limit in the infinite. But such a limit is
the absolute other of the infinite, its opposite. The infinite’s determination,
which is the in-itself as such, is corrupted by being saddled with a quality
of this sort; the infinite is thus a finitized infinite. Likewise, since the finite
is as such only the non-in-itself but equally has its opposite in it by virtue
of the said unity, it is elevated above its worth and, so to speak, infinitely
elevated; it is posited as the infinitized finite.
Likewise, just as the simple unity of infinite and finite was falsified before
by the understanding, so too is the double unity. Here also this happens
because the infinite is taken in one of the two unities not as negated but,
rather, as the in-itself in which, therefore, determinateness and restriction
116 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
should not be posited, for they would debase and corrupt it. Conversely,
21.133 the finite is equally held fixed as not negated, although null in itself; so
that, in combination with the infinite, it is elevated to what it is not and is
thereby infinitized notwithstanding its determination that has not vanished
but is rather perpetuated.
The falsification that the understanding perpetrates with respect to the
finite and the infinite, of holding their reciprocal reference fixed as qualitative
differentiation, of maintaining that their determination is separate,
indeed, absolutely separate, comes from forgetting what for the understanding
itself is the concept of these moments. According to this concept,
the unity of the finite and the infinite is not an external bringing together of
them, nor an incongruous combination that goes against their nature, one
in which inherently separate and opposed terms that exist independently
and are consequently incompatible, would be knotted together. Rather,
each is itself this unity, and this only as a sublating of itself in which neither
would have an advantage over the other in in-itselfness and affirmative
existence. As has earlier been shown, finitude is only as a transcending
of itself; it is therefore within it that the infinite, the other of itself, is
contained. Similarly, the infinite is only as the transcending of the finite;
it therefore contains its other essentially, and it is thus within it that it is
the other of itself. The finite is not sublated by the infinite as by a power
present outside it; its infinity consists rather in sublating itself.
This sublating is not, consequently, alteration or otherness in general,
not the sublating of something. That into which the finite is sublated is
the infinite as the negating of finitude. But the latter has long since been
only existence, determined as a non-being. It is only the negation, therefore,
that in the negation sublates itself. Thus infinity is determined on its side
as the negative of the finite and thereby of determinateness in general, as
an empty beyond; its sublating of itself into the finite is a return from an
empty flight, the negation of the beyond which is inherently a negative.
Present in both, therefore, is the same negation of negation. But this
negation of negation is in itself self-reference, affirmation but as turning
back to itself, that is, through the mediation that the negation of negation is.
21.134 These are the determinations that it is essential to bring to view; the second
point, however, is that in the infinite progression they are also posited, and
how they are posited therein, namely, not in their ultimate truth.
First, both are negated in that progression, the infinite aswell as the finite;
both are equally transcended. Second, they are also posited as distinct, one
after the other, each positive for itself.We sort out these two determinations
while comparing them, just as in the comparison (in an external comparing)
Existence 117
we have separated the two ways of considering them: the finite and the
infinite as referring to one another, and each taken for itself. The infinite
progression, however, says more than this. Also posited in it, though at
first still only as transition and alternation, is the connectedness of the terms
being distinguished. We now only need to see, in one simple reflection,
what is in fact present in it.
In the first place, the negation of the finite and the infinite which is
posited in the infinite progression can be taken as simple, and hence as
mutual externality, only a following of one upon the other. Starting from
the finite, the limit is thus transcended, the finite negated. We now have
its beyond, the infinite, but in this the limit rises up again; so we have the
transcending of the infinite. This twofold sublation is nonetheless partly
only an external event and an alternating of moments in general, and partly
still not posited as one unity; each of these moves beyond is an independent
starting point, a fresh act, so that the two fall apart. – But, in addition, their
connection is also present in the infinite progression. The finite comes first;
then there is the transcending of it, and this negative, or this beyond of the
finite, is the infinite; third, this negation is transcended in turn, a new limit
comes up, a finite again. – This is the complete, self-closing movement that
has arrived at that which made the beginning; what emerges is the same as
that from which the departure was made, that is, the finite is restored; the
latter has therefore rejoined itself, in its beyond has only found itself again.
The same is the case regarding the infinite. In the infinite, in the beyond
of the limit, only a new limit arises which has the same fate, namely, that
as finite it must be negated. Thus what is again at hand is the same infinite
that just now disappeared in the new limit; by being sublated, by traversing
the new limit, the infinite has not therefore advanced one jot further: it
has distanced itself neither from the finite (for the finite is just this, to pass 21.135
over into the infinite), nor from itself, for it has arrived at itself.
Thus the finite and the infinite are both this movement of each returning
to itself through its negation; they are only as implicit mediation, and the
affirmative of each contains the negative of each, and is the negation of the
negation. – They are thus a result and, as such, not in the determination
that they had at the beginning: neither is the finite an existence on its side
nor the infinite an existence or a being-in-itself beyond that existence, that
is, beyond existence in the determination of finitude. The understanding
strongly resists the unity of the finite and the infinite only because it presupposes
restriction and finitude to remain, like being-in-itself, constants.
It thereby overlooks the negation of both which is in fact present in the
infinite progression, just as it equally overlooks that the two occur in this
118 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
progression only as moments of a whole – that each emerges only through
the mediation of its opposite but, essentially, equally by means of the
sublation of its opposite.
If this immanent turning back has for the moment been reckoned to
be just as much the turning back of the finite to itself and of the infinite
to itself, noticeable in this very result is an error connected with the onesidedness
just criticized: the finite and then the infinite is each taken as
the starting point, and only in this way two results ensue. But it is a matter
of total indifference which is taken as the starting point and, with this,
the distinction caused by the duality of results dissolves of itself. This is
likewise posited in the line of the infinite progression, open-ended on both
sides, wherein each of the moments recurs in equal alternation, and it is
totally extraneous at which position the progression is arrested and taken
as beginning. – The moments are distinguished in the progression but each
is equally only moment of the other. Since both, the finite and the infinite,
are themselves moments of the progress, they are jointly the finite, and,
since they are equally jointly negated in it and in the result, this result as
the negation of their joint finitude is called with truth the infinite. Their
distinction is thus the double meaning which they both have. The finite has
the double meaning, first, of being the finite over against the infinite which
stands over against it, and, second, of being at the same time the finite
and the infinite over against the infinite. Also the infinite has the double
meaning of being one of the two moments (it is then the bad infinite)
and of being the infinite in which the two moments, itself and its other,
are only moments. Therefore, as in fact we now have it, the nature of the
infinite is that it is the process in which it lowers itself to be only one of its
determinations over against the finite and therefore itself only one of the
21.136 finites, and elevates this distinction of itself and itself to be self-affirmation
and, through this mediation, the true infinite.
This determination of the true infinite cannot be captured in the already
criticized formula of a unity of the finite and the infinite; unity is abstract,
motionless self-sameness, and the moments are likewise unmoved beings.
But, like both its moments, the infinite is rather essentially only as becoming,
though a becoming now further determined in its moments. Becoming has
for its determinations, first, abstract being and nothing; as alteration, it has
existence, something and other; now as infinite, it has finite and infinite,
these two themselves as in becoming.
This infinite, as being-turned-back-unto-itself, as reference of itself
to itself, is being – but not indeterminate, abstract being, for it is
posited as negating the negation; consequently, it is also existence or
Existence 119
“thereness,”62 for it contains negation in general and consequently determinateness.
It is, and is there, present, before us. Only the bad infinite is
the beyond, since it is only the negation of the finite posited as real and,
as such, it is abstract first negation; thus determined only as negative, it
does not have the affirmation of existence in it; held fast only as something
negative, it ought not to be there, it ought to be unattainable. However, to
be thus unattainable is not its grandeur but rather its defect, which is at
bottom the result of holding fast to the finite as such, as existent. It is the
untrue which is the unattainable, and what must be recognized is that such
an infinite is the untrue. – The image of the progression in infinity is the
straight line; the infinite is only at the two limits of this line, and always
only is where the latter (which is existence) is not but transcends itself, in
its non-existence, that is, in the indeterminate. As true infinite, bent back
upon itself, its image becomes the circle, the line that has reached itself,
closed and wholly present, without beginning and end.
True infinity, thus taken in general as existence posited as affirmative in
contrast to abstract negation, is reality in a higher sense than it was earlier
as simply determined; it has now obtained a concrete content. It is not
the finite which is the real, but rather the infinite. Thus reality is further
determined as essence, concept, idea, and so forth. In connection with the
more concrete, it is however superfluous to repeat such earlier and more
abstract categories as reality, and to use them for determinations more
concrete than they are by themselves. Such a repetition, as when it is said
that essence, or that the concept, is real, has its origin in the fact that to
uneducated thought the most abstract categories such as being, existence,
reality, finitude, are the most familiar. 21.137
The more immediate occasion, however, for recalling here the categories
of reality is that the negation, against which reality is the affirmative, is here
the negation of negation, and consequently itself posited over against that
reality which finite existence is. – Negation is thus determined as ideality;
the idealizedh is the finite as it is in the true infinite – as a determination, a
content, a distinct but not a subsistent existent, a moment rather. Ideality has
this more concrete signification which is not fully expressed through the
negation of finite existence. – As regards reality and ideality, the opposition
h The ideal [das Ideale] has a broader meaning (such as of the beautiful and its associations) than
the idealized [das Ideelle]. The former does not belong here yet, and for this reason the expression
idealized is being used. There is no such distinction made in language usage for “reality”; in German
reelle and reale are used as roughly synonymous and no interest is served in nuancing the two in
some sort of opposition.
62 I am glossing in “thereness” in order to retain Hegel’s subsequent play on words.
120 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
of finite and infinite is, however, so grasped that the finite assumes the value
of “the real,” whereas the infinite that of “the idealized”; in the same way,
further on, also the concept is regarded as an idealization, that is, as a mere
idealization, in contrast to existence in general, which is regarded as “the
real.” When contrasted in this way, it is of course of no use to have reserved
for the said concrete determination of negation the distinctive expression
of “idealization”; in that opposition of finite and infinite, we are back to
the one-sidedness of the abstract negative characteristic of the bad infinite
and still fixed in the affirmative existence of the finite.
Transition
Ideality can be called the quality of the infinite; but it is essentially the
process of becoming, and hence a transition – like the transition of becoming
into existence. We must now explicate this transition. This immanent
turning back, as the sublating of finitude – that is, of finitude as such
and equally of the negative finitude that only stands opposite to it, is only
negative finitude – is self-reference, being. Since there is negation in this
being, the latter is existence; but, further, since the negation is essentially
negation of the negation, self-referring negation, it is the existence that
carries the name of being-for-itself.
Remark 1
The infinite – in the usual sense of the bad infinite – and the progression to
21.138 infinity, such as the ought, are the expression of a contradiction that pretends
to be itself a solution and an ultimate. This infinite is a first elevation of
sense representation above the finite to thought, but to a thought which, for
content, has only a nothing, that is, a non-existent explicitly posited as such:
it is a flight beyond restrictions that fails to gather itself together within
and is unable to bring the negative back to the positive. This unfulfilled
reflection has before it both the determinations of the true infinite (namely
the opposition of the finite and the infinite, and the unity of the finite
and the infinite) but fails to bring the two thoughts together; the thought
of one unavoidably brings the other along, but this reflection lets them
only alternate. The spectacle of this alternation, this infinite progression,
occurs wherever one remains fixated on the contradiction of the unity of
two determinations and of their opposition. The finite is the sublation of
itself; it holds its negation, the infinity, in itself: unity of the two. It is the
movement beyond the finite into the infinite as the beyond of the finite:
separation of the two. But over and beyond the infinite there is another
finite; the beyond, the infinite, holds finitude: unity of the two. But this
Existence 121
finite is also a negative of the infinite: separation of the two, and so forth. –
Thus, in the relation of causality, cause and effect are inseparable; a cause
that would have no effect is not a cause, just as an effect that had no
cause would no longer be effect. This relation yields, therefore, the infinite
progression of causes and effects; something is determined as cause, but,
as something finite (and it is finite just because of its separation from the
effect), it has itself a cause, that is, it is also effect; consequently, the same
thing that was determined as cause is also determined as effect (unity of
cause and effect); what is now determined as effect has in turn a cause,
that is, the cause is to be separated from its effect and to be posited as a
different something; this new cause is however itself only an effect (unity
of cause and effect); it has an other for its cause; separation of the two
determinations, and so forth, into infinity.
We can thus restate the progression in this more appropriate form. The
claim is made that the finite and the infinite are one unity. This is a false
claim that needs correction by its opposite: the two are absolutely different
and opposed. This claim is in turn to be corrected to the effect that the
two are inseparable; that in the one determination there lies the other by
virtue of the claim to unity; and so forth to infinity. – It is easy enough
to see into the nature of the infinite: one must recognize that the infinite 21.139
progression, the developed infinity of the understanding, is constituted by
the alternation of the two determinations, of the unity and the separation
of the two moments; and then further recognize that this unity and this
separation are inseparable.
The resolution of this contradiction is not the acknowledgment of the
equal correctness, and of the equal incorrectness, of both claims – this would
only be another shape of the still abiding contradiction – but the ideality of
both, in the sense that in their distinction, as reciprocal negations, they are
only moments. That monotonous alternation of the infinite progression
is in fact the negation of both their unity and their separation. What was
demonstrated above is just as much present in it de facto: namely, that
the finite, over and beyond itself, falls into the infinite, but that, over and
beyond this infinite, it equally finds itself born anew; hence, that it rejoins
itself there, as is also the case for the infinite – so that this same negation
of negation results in affirmation, a result that thereby proves itself to be
their truth and point of origin. In this being which is thus the ideality
of the distinct moments, the contradiction has not vanished abstractly,63
but is resolved and reconciled, and the thoughts, while left intact, are
63 i.e. by abstracting from the differences that give rise to the contradiction.
122 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
also brought together. Here we have, in a graphic example, the nature of
speculative thought displayed in its determining feature: it consists solely in
grasping the opposed moments in their unity. Inasmuch as each moment
shows, as a matter of fact, that it has its opposite in it, and that in this
opposite it rejoins itself, the affirmative truth is this internally self-moving
unity, the grasping together of both thoughts, their infinity – the reference
to oneself which is not immediate but infinite.
The essence of philosophy has often been located by those already adept
in the things of thought in the task of answering the question: How does the
infinite go forth out of itself and come to finitude? – This, as opinion would
have it, escapes conceptual comprehension. In the course of this exposition,
the infinite at whose concept we have arrived will further determine itself,
and the desideratum – how the infinite (if one can so express oneself ) comes
to finitude – will be manifested in it in the full manifold of forms. Here we
21.140 are considering this question only in its immediacy and in view of the just
mentioned sense which the infinite usually carries.
It is above all on the answer to this question that whether there is a philosophy
is taken to depend, and people believe, while still professing willingness
to let the matter rest on it, that they also possess in the question itself a sort of
puzzle, an invincible talisman, that firmly secures them against the answer,
and consequently against philosophy and the attainment of it. In order to
understand questions, a certain education is required also in other subject
matters, and this is all the more the case for things philosophical if more of
an answer is to be had than that the question is an idle one. – It is fair to
expect in these questions, as is normally done, that the point at issue would
not depend on words but would rather be made intelligible through some
form or other of expression. Figurative expressions of sense representation
that are used in the question regarding the infinite, like “going forth” and
suchlike, arouse the suspicion that the question stemmed from the terrain
of vulgar representation, and that the answer is also expected to be in representations
current in everyday life and in the shape of a sensuous simile.
Take being in general, instead of the infinite. The determining of it, its
having a negation or finitude in it, seems easier to comprehend. Being is
indeed the indeterminate, but it is not immediately said in it that it is the
opposite of anything determinate. The infinite, on the contrary, contains
this note expressly; it is the non-finite. The unity of the finite and the
infinite thus appears excluded from the start; incomplete reflection is most
stubbornly opposed to this unity for precisely this reason.
But it has been shown, and it is immediately evident without expanding
further on the determination of the finite and the infinite, that the infinite,
Existence 123
in the sense in which it is taken by that incomplete reflection, namely as
standing opposite the finite, has its other in it precisely because it stands
opposed to it, and is therefore already limited and itself finite. It is the
bad infinite. The answer to the question, “how does the infinite become
finite?,” is therefore this: There is not an infinite which is infinite beforehand, 21.141
and only afterwards does it find it necessary to become finite, to go forth
into finitude; the infinite is rather for itself just as much finite as infinite.
Inasmuch as the question assumes that the infinite is by itself on the one
side, and that the finite which has gone forth from it (or from wherever it
might have come) into the divide is truly real as thus separated from the
infinite, one should say rather that it is this divide which is conceptually
incomprehensible. Neither such a finite nor such an infinite has truth; that
which has no truth, however, cannot be conceptually grasped. Yet it must
be granted that they are conceptually comprehensible. To consider them
even as they are in representation with the determination of each implicit
in the other; to have a simple insight into this inseparability which is theirs,
means that we comprehend them conceptually. This inseparability is their
concept. – In the self-subsistence of that infinite and finite, the question
sets up a false content instead; it presupposes a false connection between
them. For this reason, the question is not to be answered, but the false
presuppositions contained in it, in effect the question itself, are rather
to be denied. By thus questioning the truth of such finite and infinite,
the standpoint is altered, and this change will turn the embarrassment
which the question was supposed to cause back on the question itself.
To the reflection from which the question originated, our own question
is something new, for that reflecting lacks the speculative interest that
would lead it to ascertain for its own sake, and before it draws connections
between determinations, whether such determinations are anything true
as presupposed. To the extent, however, that the untruth of that abstract
infinite is recognized, and of the finite which is equally supposed to stand
unmoved on its side, there is this to be said of the procession of the finite
out of the infinite: the infinite goes out of itself into the finite because, in
the way it is grasped as abstract unity, it has no truth in it, no standing;
and, conversely, the finite goes forth into the infinite for the same reason.
Or it is rather to be said that the infinite proceeded to finitude from all
eternity; that, just as much as pure being, it absolutely is not by itself alone,
without having its other in it. 21.142
The question how the infinite proceeds to the finite can harbor a further
presupposition still, namely that the infinite includes the finite within
itself, and consequently that it is the unity of itself and its other, so that the
124 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
difficulty has to do essentially with the separating, for this is in opposition
to the presupposed unity. On this presupposition, the opposition insisted
upon only assumes a different form; the unity and the distinguishing are
separated from each other and held isolated. If, however, the unity is not
taken abstractly and indeterminately, but rather, as in the presupposition,
as the determinate unity of the finite and the infinite, the distinguishing
of these two is also present in it. And this distinguishing is not one that
would also let them go loose, each subsisting separately, but it rather leaves
them in the unity as idealized. This unity of the infinite and the finite, and
the distinguishing of them, are inseparable, in the same way as the finite
and the infinite.
Remark 2
The claim that the finite is an idealization defines idealism. The idealism of
philosophy consists in nothing else than in the recognition that the finite is
not truly an existent. Every philosophy is essentially idealism or at least has
idealism for its principle, and the question then is only howfar this principle
is carried out. This applies to philosophy just as much as to religion, for
religion also, no less than philosophy, will not admit finitude as a true being,
an ultimate, an absolute, or as something non-posited, uncreated, eternal.
The opposition between idealistic and realistic philosophy is therefore
without meaning. A philosophy that attributes to finite existence, as such,
true, ultimate, absolute being, does not deserve the name of philosophy.
The principles of ancient as well as more recent philosophies – whether
“water,” “matter,” or “atoms” – are universals, idealizations, not things as
given immediately, that is, in sensuous singularity. Not even the “water”
of Thales is that, for, although also empirical water, it is besides that the
in-itself or essence of all other things, and these things do not stand on their
own, self-grounded, but are posited on the basis of an other, of “water,”
that is, they are idealized. In thus calling the principle or the universal an
idealization as we have just done (and the concept, the idea, spirit, deserve
the name even more), and in saying then that the singular things of the
senses are idealizations in principle, or in their concept, and even more so
21.143 when sublated in the spirit, we must note, in passing, the same doublesidedness
that transpired in the infinite, namely that an idealization is on
the one hand something concrete, a true existent, but, on the other hand,
that its moments are no less idealizations, sublated in it; in fact, however,
there is only one concrete whole from which the moments are inseparable.
By an idealization is normally meant the form of representation. Whatever
is in any of my representations, whether in the concept, the idea,
Existence 125
the imagination, and so forth, goes by the name of idealization, so that
the “idealized” stands in general also for imaginary constructs – for representations
that are not only distinguished from anything real but should
essentially not be taken as real. In point of fact, spirit is above all the true
idealist; in spirit, even as spirit senses and represents but still more as it
thinks and conceptualizes, the content is not real existence, as so called; in
the simplicity of the I, any such external being is only sublated, it is for
me, it is in me idealized. This subjective idealism, whether it is the unconscious
idealism of consciousness in general or is consciously declared and
installed as principle, extends only to the form of representation according
to which a content is mine. In the systematized idealism of subjectivity,
this form is declared to be the only true form, one that excludes the form
of the objectivity or reality of that content, of its external existence. Such
an idealism is formal, since it does not take into consideration the content
of representation or thought, and therefore does not go past its finitude.
Nothing is lost by this idealism, both because the reality of this finite
content (the existence filled with finitude) is retained, and because, if one
abstracts from it, in itself nothing of much consequence is to be made of
it. Nor is anything gained by it, for the same reason that nothing is lost,
since the “I” remains representation, spirit still filled with the same content
of finitude. The opposition of the forms of subjectivity and objectivity
is of course itself one of finitudes; but the content, as taken up in sensation,
intuition, or also in the more abstract element of representation and
thought, contains such finitudes in full, and these, by the exclusion of that
one mode of finitude alone (of the form of subjective and objective), are
still not done away with, and even less have they fallen off on their own.
