B. FINITUDE
(a) Something and other: at first they are indifferent to one another; an
other is also an immediate existent, a something; the negation thus falls
outside both. Something is in itself in contrast to its being-for-other.
But the determinateness belongs also to its in-itself, and
(b) the determination of this in-itself in turn passes over into constitution,
and this latter, as identical with determination, constitutes the immanent
and at the same time negated being-for-another, the mit of
something which
(c) is the immanent determination of the something itself, and the something
thus is the fzzite.
In the first division where existence in general was considered, this existence
had, as at first taken up, the determination of an existent. The
moments of its development, quality and something, are therefore of
equally affirmative determination. The present division, on the contrary,
develops the negative determination which is present in existence and was
there from the start only as negation in general. It was then the fzrst negation
but has now been determined to the point of the being-in-itself of the
something, the point of the negation of negation.
4. Something and an other
I. Something and other are, first, both existents or something.
Second, each is equally an other. It is indifferent which is named first,
and just for this reason it is named something (1n Latin, when they occur
. . . . [44 3 . . . in a proposition, both are 2/u4, or “the one, the other," alius alium; in the
case of an alternating relation, the analogous expression is alter alterum).
Existence 9I
If of two beings we call the one A and the other B, the B is the one which
is first determined as other. But the A is just as much the other of the
B. Both are other in the same way. “This” serves to fix the distinction
and the something which is to be taken in the affirmative sense. But
"this" also expresses the fact that the distinction, and the privileging of one
something, is a subjective designation that falls outside the something itself.
The whole determinateness falls on the side of this external pointing; also
the expression “this” contains no distinctions; each and every something is
just as good a "this" as any other. By “this” we mean to express something
completely determinate, overlooking the fact that language, as a work of
the understanding, only expresses the universal, albeit naming it as a single
object. But an individual name is something meaningless in the sense that
it does not express a universal. It appears as something merely posited and
arbitrary for the same reason that proper names can also be arbitrarily
picked, arbitrarily given as well as arbitrarily altered.
Otherness thus appears as a determination alien to the existence thus
pointed at, or the other existence as outside this one existence, partly
because the one existence is determined as other only by being compared
by a Third, and partly because it is so determined only on account of the
other which is outside it, but is not an other for itself. At the same time,
as has been remarked, even for ordinary thinking every existence equally
determines itself as an other existence, so that there is no existence that
remains determined simply as an existence, none which is not outside an
existence and therefore is not itself an other.
Both are determined as something as well as other: thus they are the
same and there is as yet no distinction present in them. But this sameness of
determinations, too, falls only within external reflection, in the comparison
of the two; but the other, as posited at first, though an other with reference
to something, is other also for itself apart from the something.
Third, the other is therefore to be taken in isolation, with reference to
itself, has to be taken abstractly as the other, the τὸ ἕτερον of Plato who
opposes it to the one as a moment of totality, and in this way ascribes
to the other a nature of its own. Thus the other, taken solely as such, is
not the other of something, but is the other within, that is, the other of
itself. — Such an other, which is the other by its own determination, is
physical nature, nature is the other of spirit; this, its determination, is at first
a mere relativity expressing not a quality of nature itself but only a reference
external to it. But since spirit is the true something, and hence nature is
*? Hegel is repeating the argument of Chapter 1 of the Phenomenology of Spirit.
21.106
21.107
92 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
what it is within only in contrast to spirit, taken for itself the quality of
nature is just this, to be the other within, that which-exists-outside-itself (in
the determinations of space, time, matter).
The other which is such for itself is the other within it, hence the other
of itself and so the other of the other — therefore, the absolutely unequal in
itself, that which negates itself, alters itself. But it equally remains identical
with itself, for that into which it alters is the other, and this other has no
additional determination; but that which alters itself is not determined in
any other way than in this, to be an other; in going over to this other, it only
unites with itself. It is thus posited as reflected into itself with sublation of
the otherness, a self-zdentical something from which the otherness, which is
at the same time a moment of it, is therefore distinct, itself not appertaining
to it as something.
2. The something preserves itself in its non-being; it is essentially one
with it, and essentially not one with it. It therefore stands in reference to
an otherness without being just this otherness. The otherness is at once
contained in it and yet separated from it; it is being-for-other.
Existence as such is an immediate, bare of references; or, it is in the
determination of being. However, as including non-being within itself,
existence is determinate being, being negated within itself, and then in the
first instance an other — but, since in being negated it preserves itself at the
same time, it is only being-for-other.
It preserves itself in its non-being and is being; not, however, being
in general but being with reference to itself in contrast to its reference
to the other, as self-equality in contrast to its inequality. Such a being is
being-in-itself.
Being-for-other and being-in-itself constitute the two moments of something.
There are here two pairs of determinations: (1) something and
other; (2) being-for-other and being-in-itself. The former contain the nonconnectedness
of their determinateness; something and other fall apart.
But their truth is their connection; being-for-other and being-in-itself are
therefore the same determinations posited as moments of one and the same
unity, as determinations which are connections and which, in their unity,
remain in the unity of existence. Each thus itself contains within it, at the
same time, also the moment diverse from it.
Being and nothing in their unity, which is existence, are no longer
being and nothing (these they are only outside their unity); so in their
restless unity, in becoming, they are coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be. — In
the something, being is being-in-itself. Now, as self-reference, self-equality,
being is no longer immediately, but is self-reference only as the non-being
Existence 93
of otherness (as existence reflected into itself). — The same goes for nonbeing:
as the moment of something in this unity of being and non-being:
it is not non-existence in general but is the other, and more determinedly —
according as being is at the same time distinguished from it — it is reference
to its non-existence, being-for-other.
Hence being-in-itself is, first, negative reference to non-existence; it has
otherness outside it and is opposed to it; in so far as something is in itself,
it is withdrawn from being-other and being-for-other. But, second, it has
non-being also right in it; for it zs itself the non-being of being-for-other.
But being-for-other is, first, the negation of the simple reference of being
to itself which, in the first place, is supposed to be existence and something;
in so far as something is in an other or for an other, it lacks a being of
its own. But, second, it is not non-existence as pure nothing; it Is nonexistence
that points to being-in-itself as its being reflected into itself, just
as conversely the being-in-itself points to being-for-other.
3. Both moments are determinations of one and the same, namely of
something. Something is in-itself in so far as it has returned from the
being-for-other back to itself. But something has also a determination or
circumstance, whether zn itself (here the accent is on the zn) or in it; in so
far as this circumstance is 77 it externally, it is a being-for-other.
This leads to a further determination. Being-in-itself and being-for-other
are different at first. But that something also has in it what it is in itself and
conversely is in itself also what it is as being-for-other — this is the identity of
being-in-itself and being-for-other, in accordance with the determination
that the something is itself one and the same something of both moments,
and these are in it, therefore, undivided. — This identity already occurs
formally in the sphere of existence, but more explicitly in the treatment of
essence and later of the relations of interiority and externality, and in the
most determinate form in the treatment of the idea, as the unity of concept
and actuality. — Opinion has it that with the i»-itself something lofty is
being said, as with the inner; but what something is only in itself, is also only
in it; in-itself is a merely abstract, and hence itself external determination.
The expressions: there is nothing zz zt, or there is something iz it, imply,
though somewhat obscurely, that what is in a thing also pertains to its
in-itselfness, to its inner, true worth.
It may be observed that here we have the meaning of the thing-in-itself.
It is a very simple abstraction, though it was for a while a very important
determination, something sophisticated, as it were, just as the proposition
that we know nothing of what things are in themselves was a much valued
piece of wisdom. — Things are called “in-themselves” in so far as abstraction
21.108
21.109
21.110
94 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
is made from all being-for-other, which really means, in so far as they are
thought without all determination, as nothing. In this sense, of course, it
is impossible to know what the thing-in-itself is. For the question “what?”
calls for determinations to be produced; but since the things of which the
determinations are called for are at the same time presumed to be things-inthemselves,
which means precisely without determination, the impossibility
of an answer is thoughtlessly implanted in the question, or else a senseless
answer is given. — The thing-in-itself is the same as that absolute of which
nothing is known except that in it all is one. What there is 77 these thingsin-
themselves is therefore very well known; they are as such nothing but
empty abstractions void of truth. What, however, the thing-in-itself in
truth is, what there basically is in it, of this the Logic is the exposition.
But in this Logic something better is understood by the zz-;tse/f than an
abstraction, namely, what something is in its concept; but this concept is
in itself concrete: as concept, in principle conceptually graspable; and, as
determined and as the connected whole of its determinations, inherently
cognizable.
Being-in-itself has at first the being-for-other as a moment standing
over against it. But positedness also comes to be positioned over against
it, and, although in this expression being-for-other is also included, the
expression still contains the determination of the bending back, which
has already occurred, of that which is not in itself into that wherein it is
positive, and this is its being-in-itself. Being-in-itselfis normally to be taken
as an abstract way of expressing the concept; positing, strictly speaking, first
occurs in the sphere of essence, of objective reflection; the ground posits
that which is grounded through it; more strongly, the cause produces an
effect, an existence whose subsistence is immediately negated and which
carries the meaning that it has its substance, its being, in an other. In the
sphere of being, existence only emerges out of becoming. Or again, with
the something an other is posited; with the finite, an infinite; but the finite
does not bring forth the infinite, does not posit it. In the sphere of being,
the self-determining of the concept is at first only in itself or implicit, and
for that reason it is called a transition or passing over. And the reflecting
determinations of being, such as something and other, or finite and infinite,
although they essentially point to one another, or are as being-for-other,
also stand on their own qualitatively; the other exists; the finite, like the
infinite, is equally to be regarded as an immediate existent that stands firm
on its own; the meaning of each appears complete even without its other.
The positive and the negative, on the contrary, cause and effect, however
much they are taken in isolation, have at the same time no meaning each
Existence 95
without the other; their reflective shining in each other, the shine in each of
its other, is present right in them. — In the different cycles of determination
and especially in the progress of the exposition, or, more precisely, in the
progress of the concept in the exposition of itself, it is of capital concern
always to clearly distinguish what still zs zn itself or implicitly and what is
posited, how determinations are in the concept and how they are as posited
or as existing-for-other. This is a distinction that belongs only to the
dialectical development and one unknown to metaphysical philosophizing
(to which the critical also belongs); the definitions of metaphysics, like
its presuppositions, distinctions, and conclusions, are meant to assert and
produce only the existent and that, too, as existent-in-itself.
In the unity of the something with itself, being-for-other is identical with
its in-itself, the being-for-other is thus 77 the something. The determinateness
thus reflected into itself is therefore again a simple existent and hence
again a quality — determination.
b. Determination, constitution, and limit
The in-itself, in which the something is reflected into itself from its beingfor-
other, no longer is an abstract in-itself but, as the negation of its
being-for-other, is mediated through this latter, which is thus its moment.
It is not only the immediate identity of the something with itself, but
the identity by virtue of which the something also has present in it what
it is in itself, the being-for-other is present in it because the in-itself is the
sublation of it, is in itself from it; but, because it is still abstract, and therefore
essentially affected with negation, it is equally affected with being-for-other.
We have here not only quality and reality, existent determinateness, but
determinateness existent-in-itself, and the development consists in positing
such determinateness as thus immanently reflected.
I. The quality which in the simple something is an in-itself essentially in
unity with the something’s other moment, its being-in-it, can be named its
determination, provided that this word is distinguished, in a more precise
signification, from determinateness in general. Determination is affirmative
determinateness; it is the in-itself by which a something abides in its
existence while involved with an other that would determine it, by which
it preserves itself in its self-equality, holding on to it in its being-forother.
Something fulfills its determination to the extent that the further
33 Bestimmung also carries the meaning of “vocation” or “destiny” as in “die Bestimmung des Menschen,”
the vocation of humankind.
21.111
21.112
96 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
determinateness, which variously accrues to it in the measure of its beingin-
itself as it relates to an other, becomes its filling. Determination implies
that what something is in itself is also present in it.
The determination of the human being, its vocation, is rational thought:
thinking in general is his simple determinateness; by it the human being
is distinguished from the brute; he is thinking in himself, in so far as
this thinking is distinguished also from his being-for-other, from his own
natural and sensuous being that brings him in immediate association with
the other. But thinking is also 77 him; the human being is himself thinking,
he exists as thinking, thought is his concrete existence and actuality; and,
further, since thinking is in his existence and his existence is in his thinking,
thinking is concrete, must be taken as having content and filling; it is rational
thought and as such the determination of the human being. But even this
determination is again only zz itself, as an ought, that is to say, it is, together
with the filling embodied in its in-itself, in the form of an in-itself in general
as against the existence which is not embodied in it but still lies outside
confronting it, immediate sensibility and nature.
2. The filling of the being-in-itself with determinateness is also distinct
from the determinateness which is only being-for-other and remains
outside the determination. For in the sphere of the qualitative, the distinguished
terms are left, in their sublated being, also with an immediate,
qualitative being contrasting them. That which the something has zm it
thus separates itself and is from this side the external existence of the something
and also 275 existence, but not as belonging to its being-in-itself. —
Determinateness is thus constitution.
Constituted in this or that way, the something is caught up in external
influences and in external relationships. This external connection on which
the constitution depends, and the being determined through an other,
appear as something accidental. But it is the quality of the something to
be given over to this externality and to have a constitution.
In so far as something alters, the alteration falls on the side of its constitution;
the latter is that zn the something which becomes an other. The
something itself preserves itself in the alteration; the latter affects only this
unstable surface of the something’s otherness, not its determination.
Determination and constitution are thus distinct from each other; something,
according to its determination, is indifferent to its constitution.
But that which the something has 77 11 is the middle term of this syllogism
connecting the two, determination and constitution. Or, rather, the
being-in-the-something showed itself to fall apart into these two extremes.
The simple middle term is determinateness as such; its identity belongs to
Existence 97
determination just as well as to constitution. But determination passes over
into constitution on its own, and constitution into determination. This
is implied in what has been said. The connection, upon closer consideration,
is this: in so far as that which something is in itself is also in it,
the something is affected with being-for-other; determination is therefore
open, as such, to the relation with other. Determinateness is at the same
time moment, but it contains at the same time the qualitative distinction
of being different from being-in-itself, of being the negative of the something,
another existence. This determinateness which thus holds the other
in itself, united with the being-in-itself, introduces otherness in the latter or
in determination, and determination is thereby reduced to constitution. —
Conversely, the being-for-other, isolated as constitution and posited on its
own, is in it the same as what the other as such is, the other in it, that is,
the other of itself; but it consequently is se/f-referring existence, thus beingin-
itself with a determinateness, therefore determination. — Consequently,
inasmuch as the two are also to be held apart, constitution, which appears
to be grounded in something external, in an other in general, also depends
on determination, and the determining from outside is at the same time
determined by the something’s own immanent determination. And further,
constitution belongs to that which something is in itself: something
alters along with its constitution.
This altering of something is no longer the first alteration of something
merely in accordance with its being-for-other. The first was an alteration
only implicitly present, one that belonged to the inner concept; now the
alteration is also posited in the something. — The something itself is further
determined, and negation is posited as immanent to it, as its developed
being-in-itself.
The transition of determination and constitution into each other is at
first the sublation of their distinction, and existence or something in general
is thereby posited; moreover, since this something in general results from a
distinction that also includes qualitative otherness within it, there are two
somethings. But these are, with respect to each other, not just others in
general, so that this negation would still be abstract and would occur only
in the comparison of the two; rather the negation now is immanent to the
somethings. As existing, they are indifferent to each other, but this, their
affirmation, is no longer immediate: each refers itself to itself through the
intermediary of the sublation of the otherness which in determination is
reflected into the in-itselfness.
Something behaves in this way in relation to the other through itself,
since otherness is posited in it as its own moment, its in-itselfness holds
21.113
21.114
98 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
negation in itself, and it now has its affirmative existence through its
intermediary alone. But the other is also qualitatively distinguished from
this affirmative existence and is thus posited outside the something. The
negation of its other is only the quality of the something, for it is in
this sublation of its other that it is something. The other, for its part,
truly confronts an existence only with this sublation; it confronts the first
something only externally, or, since the two are in fact inherently joined
together, that is, according to their concept, their connectedness consists
in this, that existence has passed over into otherness, something into other;
that something is just as much an other as the other is. Now in so far as the
in-itselfness is the non-being of the otherness that is contained in it but
is at the same time also distinct as existent, something is itself negation,
the ceasing to be of an other in it; it is posited as behaving negatively in
relation to the other and in so doing preserving itself. This other, the initselfness
of the something as negation of the negation, is the something's
being-in-itself, and this sublation is as simple negation at the same time in
it, namely, as its negation of the other something external to it. It is one
determinateness of the two somethings that, on the one hand, as negation
of the negation, is identical with the in-itselfness of the somethings,
and also, on the other hand, since these negations are to each other as
other somethings, joins them together of their own accord and, since each
negation negates the other, equally separates them. This determinateness is
limit.
3. Being-for-other is indeterminate, affirmative association of something
with its other; in limit the non-being-for-other is emphasized, the qualitative
negation of the other, which is thereby kept out of the something
that is reflected into itself. We must see the development of this concept —
a development that will rather look like confusion and contradiction.
Contradiction immediately raises its head because limit, as an internally
reflected negation of something, ideally holds in it the moments of something
and other, and these, as distinct moments, are at the same time
posited in the sphere of existence as really, qualitatively, distinct.
a. Something is therefore immediate, self-referring existence and at first
it has a limit with respect to an other; limit is the non-being of the other,
not of the something itself; in limit, something marks the boundary of its
other. — But other is itself a something in general. The limit that something
has with respect to an other is, therefore, also the limit of the other as a
something; it is the limit of this something in virtue of which the something
holds the first something as its other away from itself, or is a non-being of
that something. The limit is thus not only the non-being of the other, but of
Existence 99
the one something just as of the other, and consequently of the something
in general.
But the limit is equally, essentially, the non-being of the other; thus,
through its limit, something at the same time zs. In limiting, something
is of course thereby reduced to being limited itself; but, as the ceasing of
the other in it, its limit is at the same time itself only the being of the
something; this something is what it is by virtue of it, has its quality in it. —
This relation is the external appearance of the fact that limit is simple
negation or the first negation, whereas the other is, at the same time, the
negation of the negation, the in-itselfness of the something.
Something, as an immediate existence, is therefore the limit with respect
to another something; but it has this limit 271 it and is something through
the mediation of that limit, which is just as much its non-being. The limit
is the mediation in virtue of which something and other each both is and
1s not.
P. Now in so far as something in its limit both zs and zs not, and these
moments are an immediate, qualitative distinction, the non-existence and
the existence of the something fall outside each other. Something has its
existence outside its limit (or, as representation would also have it, inside it);
in the same way the other, too, since it is something, has it outside it. The
limit is the middle point between the two at which they leave off. They have
existence beyond each other, beyond their limit; the limit, as the non-being
of each, is the other of both.
— It is in accordance with this difference of the something from its limit
that the /ine appears as line outside its limit, the point; the plane as plane
outside the line; the solid as solid only outside its limiting plane. — This
is the aspect of limit that first occurs to figurative representation (the selfexternal-
being of the concept) and is also most commonly assumed in the
context of spatial objects.
y. But further, something as it is outside the limit, as the unlimited
something, is only existence in general. As such, it is not distinguished
from its other; it is only existence and, therefore, it and its other have the
same determination; each is only something in general or each is other;
and so both are the same. But this, their at first immediate existence, is now
posited in them as limit: in it both are what they are, distinct from each
other. But it is also equally their common distinguishedness, the unity and
the distinguishedness of both, just like existence. This double identity of
the two, existence and limit, contains this: that something has existence
only in limit, and that, since limit and immediate existence are each at the
same time the negative of each other, the something, which is now only
21.115
21.116
IOO Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
in its limit, equally separates itself from itself, points beyond itself to its
non-being and declares it to be its being, and so it passes over into it. To
apply this to the preceding example, the one determination is this: that
something is what it is only in its limit. Therefore, the point is the limit of
line, not because the latter just ceases at the point and has existence outside
it; the /ine is the limit of plane, not because the plane just ceases at it; and
the same goes for the plane as the limit of solid. Rather, at the point the line
also begins; the point is its absolute beginning, and if the line is represented
as unlimited on both its two sides, or, as is said, as extended to infinity, the
point still constitutes its element, just as the line constitutes the element
of the plane, and the plane that of the solid. These mits are the principle
of that which they delimit; just as one, for instance, is as hundredth the
limit, but also the element, of the whole hundred.
The other determination is the unrest of the something in its limit in
which it is immanent, the contradiction that propels it beyond itself. Thus
the point is this dialectic of itself becoming line; the line, the dialectic of
becoming plane; the plane, of becoming total space. A second definition
is given of line, plane, and whole space which has the line come to be
through the movement of the point; the plane through the movement of
the line, and so forth. This movement of the point, the line, and so forth, is
however viewed as something accidental, or as movement only in figurative
representation. In fact, however, this view is taken back by supposing that
the determinations from which the line, and so forth, originate are their
elements and principles, and these are, at the same time, nothing else but
their limits; the coming to be is not considered as accidental or only as
represented. That the point, the line, the plane, are per se self-contradictory
beginnings which on their own repel themselves from themselves, and
consequently that the point passes over from itself into the line through
its concept, moves in itself and makes the line come to be, and so on — all
this lies in the concept of the limit which is immanent in the something.
The application itself, however, belongs to the treatment of space; as an
indication of it here, we can say that the point is the totally abstract limit,
but in a determinate existence; this existence is still taken in total abstraction,
it is the so-called absolute, that is, abstract space, the absolutely continuous
being-outside-one-another. Inasmuch as the limit is not abstract negation,
but is rather zn this existence, inasmuch as it is spatial determinateness, the
point is spatial, is the contradiction of abstract negation and continuity
and is, for that reason, the transition as it occurs and has already occurred
into the line, and so forth. And so there is no point, just as there is no line
or plane.
Existence IOI
The something, posited with its immanent limit as the contradiction of
itself by virtue of which it is directed and driven out and beyond itself, is
the finite.
c. Finitude
Existence is determinate. Something has a quality, and in this quality it is
not only determined but delimited; its quality is its limit and, affected by it,
something remains affirmative, quiescent existence. But, so developed that
the opposition of its existence and of the negation as the limit immanent to
this existence is the very in-itselfness of the something, and this is thus only
becoming in it, this negation constitutes the finitude of the something.
When we say of things that they are finite, we understand by this that
they not only have a determinateness, that their quality is not only reality
and existent determination, that they are not merely limited and as such
still have existence outside their limit, but rather that non-being constitutes
their nature, their being. Finite things ave, but in their reference to
themselves they refer to themselves negatively — in this very self-reference
they propel themselves beyond themselves, beyond their being. They are,
but the truth of this being is (as in Latin) their fzzs, their end.’* The finite
does not just alter, as the something in general does, but perishes, and its
perishing is not just a mere possibility, as if it might be without perishing.
Rather, the being as such of finite things is to have the germ of this
transgression” in their in-itselfness: the hour of their birth is the hour of
their death.
a. The immediacy of finitude
The thought of the finitude of things brings this mournful note with it
because finitude is qualitative negation driven to the extreme, and in the
simplicity of such a determination there zs no longer left to things an
affirmative being distinct from their determination as things destined to
ruin. Because of this qualitative simplicity of negation that has returned
to the abstract opposition of nothing and perishing to being, finitude
is the most obstinate of the categories of the understanding; negation in
M ©... (as in Latin) their finis...” is my gloss. The Latin root of “finite” and “finitude” is fis, that
is, “end.” This connection between “finite” and “end” is clear in the German, endlich, Endlichkeit,
Ende, and Hegel plays on it. I have tried to bring out this wordplay, which in English implicates
the Latin word.
5 Vergehen has the meaning of both "offence" (as in “transgression”) and "passage of time."
5 Bestimmunzgum Untergange. Bestimmung means both “determination” and “destiny” or “vocation.”
21.117
21.118
102 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
general, constitution, limit, are compatible with their other, with existence;
even the abstract nothing, by itself, is given up as an abstraction; but
finitude is negation fixed in itself and, as such, stands in stark contrast to its
affirmative. The finite thus does indeed let itself be submitted to flux; this
is precisely what it is, that it should come to an end, and this end is its only
determination. Its refusal is rather to let itself be brought affirmatively to its
affirmative, the infinite, to be associated with it; it is therefore inseparably
posited with its nothing, and thereby cut off from any reconciliation with
its other, the affirmative. The determination of finite things does not go
past their end. The understanding persists in this sorrow of finitude, for
it makes non-being the determination of things and, at the same time,
this non-being imperishable and absolute. Their transitoriness would only
pass away in their other, in the affirmative; their finitude would then be
severed from them; but this finitude is their unalterable quality, that is,
their quality which does not pass over into their other, that is, not into the
affirmative; and so finitude is eternal.
This is a very important consideration. But that the finite is absolute is
certainly not a standpoint that any philosophy or outlook, or the understanding,
would want to endorse. The opposite is rather expressly present
in the assertion of finitude: the finite is the restricted, the perishable, the
finite is only the finite, not the imperishable; all this is immediately part
and parcel of its determination and expression. But all depends on whether
in one’s view of finitude its being is insisted on, and the transitoriness thus
persists, or whether the transitoriness and the perishing perish. The fact is
that this perishing of the perishing does not happen on precisely the view
that would make the perishing the final end of the finite. The official claim
is that the finite is incompatible with the infinite and cannot be united
with it; that the finite is absolutely opposed to the infinite. Being, absolute
being, is ascribed to the infinite. The finite remains held fast over against it
as its negative; incapable of union with the infinite, it remains absolute on
its own side; from the affirmative, from the infinite, it would receive affirmation
and thus it would perish; but a union with the infinite is precisely
what is declared impossible. If the finite were not to persist over against
the infinite but were to perish, its perishing, as just said, would then be
the last of it — not its affirmative, which would be only a perishing of the
perishing. However, if it is not to perish into the affirmative but its end
is rather to be grasped as a nothing, then we are back at that first, abstract
nothing that itself has long since passed away.
With this nothing, however, which is supposed to be only nothing
but to which a reflective existence is nevertheless granted in thought, in
Existence 103
representation or in speech, the same contradiction occurs as we have
just indicated in connection with the finite, except that in the nothing
it just occurs but in the finite it is instead expressed. In the one case, the
contradiction appears as subjective; in the other, the finite is said to stand
in perpetual opposition to the infinite, in itself to be null, and to be as null
in itself. This is now to be brought to consciousness. The development
of the finite will show that, expressly as this contradiction, it collapses
internally, but that, in this collapse, it actually resolves the contradiction; it
will show that the finite is not just perishable, and that it perishes, but that
the perishing, the nothing, is rather not the last of it; that the perishing
rather perishes.
B. Restriction and the ought
This contradiction is indeed abstractly present by the very fact that the
something is finite, or that the finite zs. But something or being is no longer
posited abstractly but reflected into itself, and developed as being-in-itself
that has determination and constitution in it, or, more determinedly still,
in such a way that it has a limit within it; and this limit, as constituting
what is immanent to the something and the quality of its being-in-itself,
is finitude. It is to be seen what moments are contained in this concept of
the finite something.
Determination and constitution arose as sides for external reflection,
but determination already contained otherness as belonging to the in-itself
of something. On the one side, the externality of otherness is within the
something’s own inwardness; on the other side, it remains as otherness
distinguished from it; it is still externality as such, but zz the something.
But further, since otherness is determined as /imit, itself as negation of
the negation, the otherness immanent to the something is posited as the
connection of the two sides, and the unity of the something with itself (to
which both determination and constitution belong) is its reference turned
back upon itself, the reference to it of its implicitly existing determination
that in it negates its immanent limit. The self-identical in-itself thus refers
itself to itself as to its own non-being, but as negation of the negation, as
negating that which at the same time retains existence in it, for it is the
quality of its in-itselfness. Something's own limit, thus posited by it as a
negative which is at the same time essential, is not only limit as such, but
restriction. But restriction is not alone in being posited as negative; the
negation cuts two ways, for that which it posits as negated is /zmit, and
limit is in general what is common to something and other, and is also
21.119
21.120
104 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
the determinateness of the zn-itself of determination as such. This in-itself,
consequently, as negative reference to its limit (which is also distinguished
from it), as negative reference to itself as restriction, is the ought.
In order for the limit that is in every something to be a restriction, the
something must at the same time transcend it in itself — must refer to it
from within as to a non-existent. The existence of something lies quietly
indifferent, as it were, alongside its limit. But the something transcends
its limit only in so far as it is the sublatedness of the limit, the negative
in-itselfness over against it. And inasmuch as the limit is as restriction in
the determination itself, the something thereby transcends itself.
The ought therefore contains the double determination: once, as a determination
which has an in-itselfness over against negation; and again, as a
non-being which, as restriction, is distinguished from the determination
but is at the same time itself a determination existing in itself.57
The finite has thus determined itself as connecting determination and
limit; in this connection, the determination is the ought and the limit is the
restriction. Thus the two are both moments of the finite, and therefore both
themselves finite, the ought as well as the restriction. But only restriction is
posited as the finite; the ought is restricted only in itself, and therefore only
for us. It is restricted by virtue of its reference to the limit already immanent
within it, though this restriction in it is shrouded in in-itselfness, for
according to its determinate being, that is, according to its determinateness
in contrast to restriction, it is posited as being-in-itself.
What ought to be zs, and at the same time zs not. If it were, it would
not be what merely ought to be. The ought has therefore a restriction
essentially. This restriction is not anything alien; that which only ought to
be is determination now posited as it is in fact, namely as at the same time
only a determinateness.
The being-in-itself of the something is thus reduced in its determination
to the ought because the very thing that constitutes the something’s initselfness
is, in one and the same respect, as non-being; or again, because
in the in-itselfness, in the negation of the negation, the said being-in-itself
is as one negation (what negates) a unity with the other, and this other, as
qualitatively other, is the limit by virtue of which that unity is as reference
7 Hegel is making a deflationary move here. The “ought” is nothing special. It defines explicitly the
true relation that obtains between any subject and its predicate. The subject is its predicate while
at the same time being distinguished from it. The relation between the two is therefore always one
of identity but at a distance. The predicate is what the subject is “destined” or “said” to be. It is
important to keep in mind that Bestimmung in German means both, “determination” and “destiny”
or “vocation.”
Existence IOS
to it? The restriction of the finite is not anything external, but the finite's
own determination is rather also its restriction; and this restriction is both
itself and the ought it is that which is common to both, or rather that in
which the two are identical.
But further, as “ought” the finite transcends its restriction; the same
determinateness which is its negation is also sublated, and is thus its initself;
its limit is also not its limit.
As ought something is thus elevated above its restriction, but conversely
it has its restriction only as ought. The two are indivisible. Something has
a restriction in so far as it has negation in its determination, and the
determination is also the being sublated of the restriction.
Remark
The ought has of late played a major role in philosophy, especially in
connection with morality but also in metaphysics in general, as the final
and absolute concept of the identity of the in-itself or of se/f-reference, and
of determinateness or the limit.
“You can because you ought.” This expression, which is supposed to
say a lot, is implied in the concept of the ought. For the ought is the
transcendence of restriction; restriction is sublated in it, the in-itself of the
ought is thus identical self-reference, and consequently the abstraction of
"being able.” — But, conversely, “you cannot, even though you ought’ is just
as correct. For the restriction as restriction is equally implied in the ought;
the one formalism of possibility has in it a reality, a qualitative otherness,
that stands opposed to it, and the connection of each to the other is a
contradiction, and thus a “cannot” or rather an impossibility.
In the ought the transcendence of finitude, infinity, begins. The ought
is that which, in the subsequent development, in accordance with the said
impossibility, will display itself as a progress to infinity.
Regarding the form of restriction and of the ought, two prejudices deserve
more detailed criticism. First, much is commonly made of the restrictions of
thought, of reason, and so forth, and the claim is made that it is impossible
This is a very convoluted sentence. Hegel’s point seems to be this. A subject is reflectively what it is
by negating that its predicate (otherwise qualitatively other than it) is truly an other. The subject is
that predicate as other; it negates the predicate as a would-be other (1.6. as a negative with respect
to it). The subject is therefore reflectively what the predicate is qualitatively (1.6. immediately). It is
what the predicate is, but at a distance as it were. Its self-identity (the negation of the negation that
constitutes its internal being) is thus modified by carrying a reference to the would-be, qualitatively
independent predicate. The latter is what the subject ought to be, what it is “destined” or “said” to
be.

to transcend such restrictions. What is lost track of in this claim is that
something is already transcended by the very fact of being determined as a
restriction. For a determinateness, a limit, is determined as restriction only
in opposition to its other in general, that is, in opposition to that which
is without its restriction; the other of a restriction is precisely the beyond
with respect to it. Stone, metal, do not transcend their restriction, for the
simple reason that the restriction is not a restriction for them. However,
with respect to such general propositions that are typical of the way the
understanding thinks, as that it is impossible to transcend restriction, if
thought will not apply itself to see what is implied in the concept, it can
then be referred to actuality, where the propositions prove themselves to be
completely unrealistic. Just because thought ought to be something higher
than actuality, just because it ought to dwell in higher regions remote from
it, and therefore be itself determined as an ought, it fails on the one hand
to advance to the concept, and on the other hand it manages to be equally
untrue both in its relation to actuality and to the concept. — Because a stone
does not think, does not even feel, its determinateness is not a restriction
for it, that is, it is not in it a negation for the sensation, the representation,
the thought, and so on, which it does not have. But the stone too is as a
something distinguished in its determination or its in-itself and existence,
and to this extent it too transcends its restriction; the concept which the
stone is in itself contains the identity with its other. If it is a base receptive
to acids then it is oxidizable, neutralizable, and so on. In the process of
oxidization, neutralization, and so on, its restriction to being only a base is
sublated; the base transcends it; similarly, the acid transcends its restriction
to being an acid, and in the acid just as in the caustic base the ought, the
imperative to transcend their restriction, is so strong that it is only with
violence that they can be kept fixed as acid and caustic base (as waterless,
that is, purely non-neutral).
If, however, a concrete existence contains the concept not merely as
abstract in-itselfness, but as a totality existing for itself, as instinct, life, sensation,
representation, and so forth, it itself then brings about, by itself, this
transcendence and this transcending. The plant transcends the restriction
of being a seed, similarly, of being blossom, fruit, leaf; the seed becomes
the developed plant, the blossom fades, and so forth. In the grip of hunger,
thirst, and so forth, the sentient is the impulse to transcend this restriction,
and it does transcend it. It feels pain, and to feel pain is the privilege of
sentient nature. Pain is a negation within the sentient’s self, and this negation
is determined as a restriction in the sentient's feeling just because the
sentient has a feeling of its se/f, and this self is the totality that transcends
Existence 107
the determinateness of the negation. If the sentient did not transcend it,
it would not feel it as its negation and would have no pain. — But reason,
thought, is not supposed to be able to transcend this restriction: reason,
which is the universal, which is for itself the beyond of particularity as
such, that is, of all particularity, only is the transcendence of restriction. —
To be sure, not every transcending, not every transcendence beyond restriction,
is a true liberation from it, a true affirmation; even the “ought” itself
is this kind of imperfect transcending, and so abstraction in general. But
the mention of a totally abstract universal is sufficient to counter the
equally abstract pronouncement that restriction cannot be transcended,
or, again, the mention of the infinite in general is sufficient to counter the
pronouncement that the finite cannot be transcended.
We can recall in this context a seemingly ingenious notion of Leibniz:
that ifa magnet had consciousness, it would regard its pointing to the North
as a determination of its will, a law of its freedom.?? Rather, if the magnet
did have consciousness and along with it a will and freedom, it would be a
thinking being. Consequently, space would be for it a universal embracing
all directions, and its one direction to the North thus a restriction rather
of its freedom — just as being held fixed to one place is a restriction for a
human being, but not for a plant.
The ought, for its part, is the transcending of restriction, but a transcending
which is itself only finite. It therefore has its place and legitimacy in the
field of finitude, where it holds in-itself fixed over against what is restricted,
declaring it to be the norm and the essential relative to what is null. Duty
is an ought directed against the particular will, against self-seeking desire
and arbitrary interest; it is the ought held up before a will capable of isolating
itself from the truth because of its instability. Those who hold the
ought of morality so high as to believe that, by not recognizing it as the
ultimate truth, morality itself would be destroyed; the brokers of reason
whose understanding takes unceasing satisfaction in being able to confront
everything that there is with an ought and consequently a would-be superior
knowledge — who therefore are all the more resistant to being robbed
of the ought — these do not see that, as regards the finitude of their sphere,
the ought receives full recognition. — But in the actual order of things,
reason and law are not in such a sad state of affairs that they only ought
to be (only the abstraction of the in-itself stays at this); equally, the ought
does not perpetuate itself nor, which is the same, is finitude absolute. The
philosophy of Kant and Fichte holds out the ought as the resolution of

the contradictions of reason — though it is rather only a standpoint that
remains fixed in finitude and therefore in contradiction.
y. Transition of the finite into the infinite
The ought contains restriction explicitly, for itself, and restriction contains
the ought. Their mutual connection is the finite itself, which contains them
both in its in-itself. These moments of its determination are qualitatively
opposed; restriction is determined as the negative of the ought, and the
ought equally as the negative of restriction. The finite is thus in itself the
contradiction of itself; it sublates itself, it goes away and ceases to be.f!
But this, its result, the negative as such, is (a) its very determination; for
it is the negative of the negative. So, in going away and ceasing to be,
the finite has not ceased; it has only become momentarily an other finite
which equally is, however, a going-away as a going-over into another finite,
and so forth 7o infinity. But, (B) if we consider this result more closely, in
its going-away and ceasing-to-be, in this negation of itself, the finite has
attained its being-in-itself; in it, it has rejoined itself. Each of its moments
contains precisely this result; the ought transcends the restriction, that is,
it transcends itself; but its beyond, or its other, is only restriction itself.
Restriction, for its part, immediately points beyond itself to its other, and
this is the ought; but this ought is the same diremption of in-itselfness and
determinateness as is restriction; it is the same thing; in going beyond itself,
restriction thus equally rejoins itself. This zZentzty with itself, the negation
of negation, is affirmative being, is thus the other of the finite which is
supposed to have the first negation for its determinateness; this other is the
infinite.
