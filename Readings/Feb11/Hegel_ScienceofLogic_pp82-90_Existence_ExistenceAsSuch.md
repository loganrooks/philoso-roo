CHAPTER 2
Existence
Existence is determinate being; its determinateness is existent determinateness,
quality. Through its quality, something is opposed to an other; it is
alterable and finite, negatively determined not only towards an other, but
absolutely within it. This negation in it, in contrast at first with the finite
something, is the infinite, the abstract opposition in which these determinations
appear resolves itself into oppositionless infinity, into being-for-itself.
The treatment of existence is therefore in three divisions:
A. existence as such
B. something and other, finitude
C. qualitative infinity.
A. EXISTENCE AS SUCH
In existence (a) as such, its determinateness is first (b) to be distinguished as
quality. The latter, however, is to be taken in both the two determinations of
existence as reality and negation. In these determinacies, however, existence
is equally reflected into itself, and, as so reflected, it is posited as (c)
something, an existent.
a. Existence in general
Existence proceeds from becoming. It is the simple oneness of being and
nothing. On account of this simplicity, it has the form of an immediate. Its
mediation, the becoming, lies behind it; it has sublated itself, and existence
therefore appears as a first from which the forward move is made. It is
at first in the one-sided determination of being; the other determination
which it contains, nothing, will likewise come up in it, in contrast to the
first.
It is not mere being but existence, or Dasein [in German]; according to
its [German] etymology, it is being (Sein) in a certain place (da). But the
83
21.97

representation of space does not belong here. As it follows upon becoming,
existence is in general being with a non-being, so that this non-being is taken
up into simple unity with being. Non-being thus taken up into being with
the result that the concrete whole is in the form of being, of immediacy,
constitutes determinateness as such.
The whole is likewise in the form or determinateness of being, since in
becoming being has likewise shown itself to be only a moment — something
sublated, negatively determined. It is such, however, for us, in our reflection;
not yet as posited in it. What is posited, however, is the determinateness as
such of existence, as is also expressed by the da (or “there”) of the Dasein. —
The two are always to be clearly distinguished. Only that which is posited in
a concept belongs in the course of the elaboration of the latter to its content.
Any determinateness not yet posited in the concept itself belongs instead to
our reflection, whether this reflection is directed to the nature of the concept
itself or is a matter of external comparison. To remark on a determinateness
of this last kind can only be for the clarification or anticipation of the whole
that will transpire in the course of the development itself. That the whole,
the unity of being and nothing, is in the one-sided determinateness of being
is an external reflection; but in negation, in something and other, and so
forth, it will become posited. — It was necessary here to call attention to
the distinction just given; but to comment on all that reflection can allow
itself, to give an account of it, would lead to a long-winded anticipation
of what must transpire in the fact itself. Although such reflections may
serve to facilitate a general overview and thus facilitate understanding,
they also bring the disadvantage of being seen as unjustified assertions,
unjustified grounds and foundations, of what is to follow. They should
be taken for no more than what they are supposed to be and should be
distinguished from what constitutes a moment in the advance of the fact
itself.
Existence corresponds to being in the preceding sphere. But being is the
indeterminate; there are no determinations that therefore transpire in it.
But existence is determinate being, something concrete; consequently, several
determinations, several distinct relations of its moments, immediately
emerge in it.
b. Quality
On account of the immediacy with which being and nothing are one in
existence, neither oversteps the other; to the extent that existence is existent,
to that extent it is non-being; it is determined. Being is not the universal,
Existence 85
determinateness not the particular.” Determinateness has yet to detach itself
from being; nor will it ever detach itself from it, since the now underlying
truth is the unity of non-being with being; all further determinations will
transpire on this basis. But the connection which determinateness now has
with being is one of the immediate unity of the two, so that as yet no
differentiation between the two is posited.
Determinateness thus isolated by itself, as existent determinateness, is
quality — something totally simple, immediate. Determinateness in general
is the more universal which, further determined, can be something quantitative
as well. On account of this simplicity, there is nothing further to
say about quality as such.
Existence, however, in which nothing and being are equally contained,
is itself the measure of the one-sidedness of quality as an only zmmediate
or existent determinateness. Quality is equally to be posited in the
determination of nothing, and the result is that the immediate or existent
determinateness is posited as distinct, reflected, and the nothing, as thus
the determinate element of determinateness, will equally be something
reflected, a negation. Quality, in the distinct value of existent, is reality;
when affected by a negating, it is negation in general, still a quality but one
that counts as a lack and is further determined as limit, restriction.
Both are an existence, but in reality, as quality with the accent on being
an existent, that it is determinateness and hence also negation is concealed;
reality only has, therefore, the value of something positive from which
negating, restriction, lack, are excluded. Negation, for its part, taken as
mere lack, would be what nothing is; but it is an existence, a quality, only
determined with a non-being.
Remark
Reality may seem to be an ambiguous word, since it is used in different,
even opposite determinations. In philosophical usage, for instance, one
speaks of mere empirical reality as of a worthless being. But when it is
said of thoughts, concepts, theories, that they have no reality, this means
that there is no actuality to them. Of the idea of a Platonic republic, for
instance, it is said that it might well be true zz ztself or in its concept. Here
the idea is not denied its value and is even allowed room alongside reality.
However, as against the so-called mere ideas, the mere concepts, “the real”
counts as alone true. — The sense in which external existence is made the
criterion of the truth of a content is for its part just as one-sided as when
^. This will happen in the Subjective Logic, when the logical object assumes the form of “concept.”
21.99
21.100
86 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
the idea, the essence, or even inner feeling, is represented as indifferent to
external existence and is even held to be all the more estimable the more
remote it is from reality.
In connection with the term “reality,” mention must be made of the
former metaphysical concept of God that was once made the foundation of
the so-called ontological proof of God's existence. God was defined as the
sum-total of all realities, and of this sum-total it was said that it contained
no contradiction within, that none of the realities canceled any other, for
a reality is to be taken only as a perfection, as something affirmative that
contains no negation. Consequently, as it was said, the realities are not in
opposition and do not contradict one another.
On this concept of reality, the assumption is that the latter still remains
after all negation has been thought away; however, to do this is to remove
all determinateness from reality. Reality is quality, existence; it therefore
contains the moment of the negative and is the determinate being that it
is only through it. Taken in the so-called eminent sense, or as infinite in
the ordinary meaning of the word — as we are said we should — reality is
expanded into indeterminateness and loses its meaning. God’s goodness
is supposed to be such not in the ordinary sense but eminently; it is not
different from justice but is rather tempered by it (an expression of mediation
of Leibnizian origin)^* just as contrariwise justice is tempered by goodness;
and so neither is goodness goodness any longer, nor justice justice. Power
should be tempered by wisdom — but is then no longer power as such, for
it is subject to wisdom. — Wisdom should be expanded into power, but
then it vanishes as end and measure setting wisdom. The true concept of
the infinite and of its absolute unity that will later emerge? is not to be
understood as a tempering, a mutual restricting or blending — a superficial,
nebulous connection that can only satisfy mindless representation. — When
reality, taken in the sense of a determinate quality as in the said definition
of God, is made to transgress its determinateness, it ceases to be reality;
it becomes abstract being; God as the pure reality in all realities, or as the
sum-total of all realities, is the same empty absolute, void of determination
and content, in which all is one.
If, on the contrary, reality is taken in its determinateness, then, since
it essentially contains the moment of the negative, the sum-total of all
realities becomes just as much a sum-total of all negations, the sum-total

Existence 87
of all contradictions, a sort of first absolute power in which everything
determinate is absorbed. However, since reality only exists in so far as it still
has over against it something which it has not sublated, by being thought
expanded in this way into an accomplished power void of restrictions, it
becomes the abstract nothing. The said reality in everything real, the being
in all existence that should express the concept of God, is nothing else than
abstract being, the same as nothing.
That determinateness is negation posited as affirmative is Spinoza’s
proposition: omnis determinatio est negatio,*° a proposition of infinite
importance. Only, negation as such is formless abstraction. However, speculative
philosophy must not be accused of taking negation or nothing as an
ultimate: negation is as little an ultimate for it as reality is for it the truth.
The unity of Spinoza’ substance, or that there is only one substance,
is the necessary consequence of this proposition, that determinateness is
negation. Spinoza had of necessity to posit thought and being or extension,
the two determinations, namely, which he had before him, as one in this
unity," for as determinate realities the two are negations whose infinity
is their unity;# according to Spinoza’s definition, about which more later
on,? the infinity of something is its affirmation. He therefore conceived
them as attributes, that is, such as do not have a particular subsistence,
a being-in-and-for-itself, but only are as sublated as moments; or rather,
since substance is the total void of internal determinateness, they are not
even moments; the attributes, like the modes, are distinctions made by
an external understanding. — Also the substantiality of individuals cannot
hold its own before that substance. The individual refers to itself by setting
limits to every other; but these limits are therefore also the limits of its
self; they are references to the other; the individual's existence is not in the
individual. True, the individual is more than just restrictions on all sides;
but this more belongs to another sphere, that of the concept; in the metaphysics
of being, the individual is an absolutely determinate something;
and against this something, against this finite that would be in and for
itself as such, determinateness asserts itself essentially as negation, dragging
it into the same negative movement of the understanding that makes
everything vanish into the abstract unity of substance.
Negation stands immediately over against reality; further on, in the
sphere proper to reflected determinations, it will be opposed to the positive,

which is reality reflecting upon negation — the reality in which the negative,
still hiding in reality as such, shines forth.??
Quality specifically is a property only when, in an external connection,
it manifests itself as an immanent determination. By properties of herbs,
for instance, we understand determinations which are not just proper to
a something but are such that, in virtue of them, the something holds its
own while referring to others and will not give in to the alien influences
posited in it by them; on the contrary, it zmposes its own determinations
in the other — though it does not keep it at a distance. On the other hand,
more stable determinacies such as figure or shape are not called properties,
nor even qualities, for they are thought of as alterable and therefore as not
identical with being.
“Qualierung’ or “Inqualierung,” an expression of Jacob Boehmes profound
but also profoundly turbid philosophy, signifies the movement
within a quality (sourness, bitterness, fieriness, etc.) inasmuch as in its
negative nature (in its Qual or torment) the quality posits itself, securing
itself from another; it signifies in general the internal unrest of quality by
which it produces and preserves itself only in conflict.”
c. Something
In existence its determinateness has been distinguished as quality; in this
quality as something existing, the distinction exists — the distinction of
reality and negation. Now though these distinctions are present in existence,
they are just as much null and sublated. Reality itself contains negation; it
is existence, not indeterminate or abstract being. Negation is for its part
equally existence, not the supposed abstract nothing but posited here as it
is in itself, as existent, as belonging to existence. Thus quality is in general
unseparated from existence, and the latter is only determinate, qualitative
being.
This sublating of the distinction is more than the mere retraction and
external re-omission of it, or a simple return to the simple beginning, to
existence as such. The distinction cannot be left out, for it zs. Therefore,
what de facto is at hand is this: existence in general, distinction in it, and the
sublation of this distinction; the existence, not void of distinctions as at the
9? Cf. below 11.273ff.

Existence 89
beginning, but as again self-equal through the sublation of the distinction;
the simplicity of existence mediated through this sublation. This state of
sublation of the distinction is existence’s own determinateness; existence is
thus being-in-itself; it is existent, something.
Something is the first negation of negation, as simple existent selfreference.
Existence, life, thought, and so forth, essentially take on the
determination of an existent being, a living thing, a thinking mind (“I”),
and so forth. This determination is of the highest importance if we do not
wish to halt at existence, life, thought, and so forth, as generalities — also
not at Godhood (instead of God). In common representation, something
rightly carries the connotation of a real thing. Yet it still is a very superficial
determination, just as reality and negation, existence and its determinateness,
though no longer the empty being and nothing, still are quite abstract
determinations. For this reason they also are the most common expressions,
and a reflection that is still philosophically unschooled uses them the most;
it casts its distinctions in them, fancying that in them it has something
really well and firmly determined. — As something, the negative of the negative
is only the beginning of the subject — its in-itselfness is still quite
indeterminate. It determines itself further on, at first as existent-for-itself
and so on, until it finally obtains in the concept the intensity of the subject.
At the base of all these determinations there lies the negative unity
with itself. In all this, however, care must be taken to distinguish the first
negation, negation as negation in general, from the second negation, the
negation of negation which is concrete, absolute negativity, just as the first
is on the contrary only abstract negativity.
Something is an existent as the negation of negation, for such a negation
is the restoration of the simple reference to itself — but the something is
thereby equally the mediation of itself with itself. Present in the simplicity
of something, and then with greater determinateness in being-for-itself, in
the subject, and so forth, this mediation of itself with itself is also already
present in becoming, but only as totally abstract mediation; mediation
with ztself is posited in the something in so far as the latter is determined as
a simple zdentity. — Attention can be drawn to the presence of mediation
in general, as against the principle of the alleged bare immediacy of a
knowledge from which mediation should be excluded. But there is no
further need to draw particular attention to the moment of mediation,
since it is to be found everywhere and on all sides, in every concept.
This mediation with itself which something is 77 itself, when taken only
as the negation of negation, has no concrete determinations for its sides;
thus it collapses into the simple unity which is being. Something is, and
21.104
21.105
90 Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
is therefore also an existent. Further, it is in itself also becoming, but a
becoming that no longer has only being and nothing for its moments.
One of these moments, being, is now existence and further an existent.
The other moment is equally an existent, but determined as the negative of
something — an other. As becoming, something is a transition, the moments
of which are themselves something, and for that reason it is an alteration — a
becoming that has already become concrete. — At first, however, something
alters only in its concept; it is not yet posited in this way, as mediated and
mediating, but at first only as maintaining itself simply in its reference to
itself; and its negative is posited as equally qualitative, as only an other in
general.
