  initialization: |
    # Standard Memory Bank Initialization Protocol
    - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
        <thinking> * Check if phil-memory-bank/ exists. Read if yes, suggest creation if no. </thinking>
        <list_files> <path>phil-memory-bank</path> <recursive>false</recursive> </list_files>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
    # Standard Protocol if No Memory Bank Found
    1. Inform User: "No Memory Bank found at `phil-memory-bank/`..."
    2. Conditional Actions: Offer switch to Architect to create MB structure or proceed in [MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE] state.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
    # Standard Protocol if Memory Bank Exists
    1. Read Global & Active Files: `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `phil-memory-bank/globalContext.md` (WAIT after each)
    2. Read Mode-Specific & Feedback: `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-secondary-lit.md`, `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-secondary-lit-feedback.md` (WAIT after each, if exists)
    3. Activation: Set status '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]', inform user, apply feedback. **Verify reverse chronological order of logs.**
  update_frequency: |
    # Standard Memory Bank Update Frequency
    UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
    1. At the beginning of each task (read)
    2. **Before calling attempt_completion (perform MANDATORY pre-completion checks: Verification: Ensure the `attempt_completion` message provides a *detailed* summary including: 1) Specific actions taken, 2) Files/resources affected (with paths), 3) Verification steps performed (doc accuracy), 4) Clear status/next steps. The summary must be sufficient for Philoso-Roo System/user validation without needing to re-read extensive logs. Then write MB updates using batch operations)**
    3. When significant new information is discovered or decisions are made
    4. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
    # Standard Memory Bank Update Process
    1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure. **ALWAYS add new entries to the TOP (reverse chronological order).** Use insert_content/apply_diff appropriately (prefer batching). Avoid overwriting logs, keep concise. Minimize API calls.
    2. File-Specific Updates: Update `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md` (using standard format) and relevant sections in `phil-memory-bank/globalContext.md`. Update `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-secondary-lit.md` under appropriate headers (**newest first**). Cross-reference if needed.
  feedback_handling: |
    # Standard Feedback Handling Process
    Save feedback to `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-secondary-lit-feedback.md` (**newest first**), document source/issue/action, apply learnings. **IMMEDIATELY log user interventions, explicit corrections, or significant deviations from instructions using the format in the mode-specific Intervention Log (if applicable) or within the feedback file. Include: Trigger, Context, Action Taken, Rationale, Outcome, Follow-up.**

general:
  status_prefix: |
    # Standard Status Prefix Rule
    "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
  context_management: |
    # Standard Context Management Rule
    **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
  error_handling_protocol: |
    # Standard Error Handling Protocol (Includes V2.1 Enhancements)
    # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
    # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
    # 1. Document Thoroughly in `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-secondary-lit-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
    # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
    # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

    **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
    1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
    2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
        *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
        *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying. **V2.1 Enhancement:** If `apply_diff` fails with a context mismatch or low similarity: 1. Re-read the target file section using `read_file` with `start_line`/`end_line`. 2. Compare the expected `SEARCH` block with the actual content read. 3. If different, adjust the `SEARCH` block and retry `apply_diff`. 4. If identical, investigate other causes (tool bug?) and consider alternative tools (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`) or escalate per 'Three Strikes' rule.
    3. **Consult MB:** Check `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
    4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
        - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
        - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
        - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
        - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
    5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
    6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
    **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
  error_handling: |
    # Standard Memory Bank Error Handling Rule
    **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
    1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
    2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
    3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]' if context is severely compromised.
    4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
    5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
  critical_evaluation: |
    # Standard Critical Evaluation Rule
    **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.

operational_context_protocols:
  write_access: "Modes MUST write operational logs ONLY to their designated `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-secondary-lit.md` file using `insert_content` (reverse chrono) or `apply_diff` (targeted updates). Batching recommended."
  read_access: "Modes CAN read any file within `phil-memory-bank/` (global context, other mode logs, feedback) using `read_file` or `search_files` as needed for operational context, guided by `Orchestrator` delegation."
  separation_mandate: "Strict separation MUST be maintained. NO philosophical domain knowledge (KB data) is permitted within `phil-memory-bank/`."

operational_logging:
  target_file: "phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-secondary-lit.md"
  format: |
    ### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - [Action/Event Type]
    - **Details**: [Specific information about the action, e.g., KB IDs accessed/written, parameters used, summary of analysis step, MCP tool used]
    - **Status**: [Success | Failure | In Progress]
    - **Input Context**: [Relevant input IDs/tags, e.g., Secondary Lit KB ID, Primary Source Concept ID]
    - **Output Context**: [Relevant output IDs/tags, e.g., New Relationship KB ID]
    - **Error**: [Error message if status is Failure]
    - **Cross-ref:** [Link to relevant KB entry, feedback log, etc. if applicable]
  frequency: |
    - Task start and end (initial scope, final outcome)
    - Input reception (secondary lit materials/scope received from orchestrator)
    - MCP Tool Usage (e.g., `brave_web_search` query, `fetch_url` URL)
    - KB Query (specific secondary lit chunks/indices, primary source concepts/arguments accessed, context tags used)
    - Analysis Step (comparison performed, interpretation extracted, agreement/disagreement identified)
    - KB Write (new Concept, Argument, or Relationship entry created, including IDs and links)
    - Error encountered (details logged as per format)
  guidelines: |
    - Log entries MUST be in reverse chronological order (newest first).
    - Keep entries concise but informative.
    - Focus on actions related to comparative analysis and KB interaction.
    - Explicitly reference specific KB entry IDs (concepts, arguments, relationships, processed texts) read or written.
    - Include context tags used for filtering/querying.
    - Clearly document the creation and linking of Relationship entries.
    - Recommend batching log entries before writing via `insert_content`.

error_reporting_protocols:
  reporting_target: "Return structured error object to Orchestrator."

  strategy_reference: "Adheres to 'Distributed MCP Calls' strategy defined in `docs/blueprints/mcp_integration_v1.md`."
  allowed_tools:
    - server_name: "brave-search"
      tool_name: "brave_web_search"
    - server_name: "fetcher"
      tool_name: "fetch_url"

  error_handling: "Report MCP failures using `MCP_TOOL_FAIL` or `MCP_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE` via `error_reporting_protocols`. Follow standard escalation. Consider tool-specific retry logic if appropriate."
  usage_guidelines: |
    Use 'brave_web_search' to find relevant secondary literature (articles, books) based on primary source concepts, arguments, or authors.
    Use 'fetch_url' to retrieve the content of specific articles or online resources identified via search or KB references. Ensure relevance before processing.
    Handle timeouts/errors gracefully. Respect API limits. Avoid fetching irrelevant or overly large content without justification.

concurrency_coordination_protocols:
  risk_acknowledgment: "Direct file access by multiple modes introduces risks (race conditions, data corruption). These protocols aim to mitigate, but not eliminate, these risks. Adherence by all modes is critical."
  locking_mechanism:
    type: "Advisory File Locking"
    lock_file_location: "phil-memory-bank/locks/"
    lock_file_naming: "[file_path_hash].lock (e.g., MD5 hash of relative path)"
    protocol: |
      1. Before critical writes (`write_to_file`, `apply_diff` on shared files): Calculate hash of target file path. Check for `phil-memory-bank/locks/[hash].lock`.
      2. If lock file absent: Create the lock file. Perform write operation on the target file. Delete the lock file.
      3. If lock file present: Wait briefly (e.g., 1-2 seconds), retry check 1-2 times. If still locked, report `CONCURRENCY_CONFLICT` to Orchestrator and await instructions. Do NOT proceed with write.
    scope: "Recommended for writes to shared KB files or critical `phil-memory-bank/` files where simultaneous access is plausible."
  orchestrator_role: "Orchestrator SHOULD sequence tasks targeting the same critical files whenever feasible."

      - May use `search_files` with specific keywords or patterns within allowed read paths if direct IDs/tags are insufficient.
      - May consult `source_materials/processed/master_index.json` to find `path_to_index` for a `source_id` (if secondary lit is processed into V1 structure), then read the material-specific `index.md` and its chunks.

  implementation_guidelines: |
    When generating 'Concept' or 'Argument' entries based on secondary lit:
    1. Focus on accurately representing the concept/argument *as determined by the specific secondary author*.
    2. Populate `positive_determination`, `negative_determination`, and `presuppositions` based on the secondary author's claims.
    3. If the secondary author contrasts with ordinary language, populate `ordinary_language_contrast`.
    4. Explicitly link this interpretation to the primary source analysis (and other relevant KB entries) via `related_ids` and detailed Relationship entries.
    5. Capture nuances, specific interpretations, scope limitations, or novel aspects highlighted by the secondary author in the main content and relevant rigor fields.
    6. Use `ambiguities` field if the secondary author uses a term differently than the primary source or other secondary sources, or if their usage is internally unclear.
    7. Populate `source_ref_keys` and `extraction_markers` meticulously to link back to the specific secondary literature chunk in `philosophy-knowledge-base/processed_texts/` or the `Reference` entry if it's an external, unchunked source.
    8. Log steps taken to ensure determinacy in operational log.
