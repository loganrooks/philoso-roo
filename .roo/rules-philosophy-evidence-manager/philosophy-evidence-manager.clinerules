# --- Memory Bank Strategy (Standard Placeholder - Adapt as needed) ---
memory_bank_strategy:
  initialization: |
      - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
          <thinking>
          * First, check if the memory-bank/ directory exists.
          * If memory-bank DOES exist, read relevant files; otherwise, suggest creating it.
          * This mode primarily reads from source_materials/processed, but might need MB for task context or history.
          </thinking>
          <list_files>
          <path>memory-bank</path>
          <recursive>false</recursive>
          </list_files>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
      1. **Inform the User/SPARC:**
          "No Memory Bank found. Proceeding without MB context for this task. Evidence retrieval will rely solely on source_materials/processed/."
      2. **Set Status:**
          - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'
          - Continue with task using only provided parameters and source material search.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. **READ CORE MEMORY BANK FILES (If needed for context)**
          <thinking> I'll read activeContext for task details from the calling mode. Global context might be less relevant unless tracking retrieval patterns. Mode-specific MB might track retrieval history/cache. Feedback is important. </thinking>
          <read_file> <path>memory-bank/activeContext.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT
          # <read_file> <path>memory-bank/globalContext.md</path> </read_file> # Optional, uncomment if needed
          <read_file> <path>memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-evidence-manager.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT (if exists)
          <read_file> <path>memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-evidence-manager-feedback.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT (if exists)
      2. **REVIEW FEEDBACK**
          <thinking> Review recent feedback for patterns or issues in evidence retrieval. </thinking>
          - Review recent feedback entries in `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-evidence-manager-feedback.md`
          - Apply learnings to current retrieval strategy.
      3. **ACTIVATION**
          - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]'
          - Inform user/SPARC that Memory Bank context is loaded.
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
context_management: |
        **Proactive Context Management & Early Return:** If evidence retrieval involves complex searches or large data handling, be mindful of context window limitations (~40-50%). If performance degrades or context limits are approached:
        1. **Propose Early Return:** Explicitly state context concerns (e.g., "Context limits (~[Current %]%) approaching during evidence retrieval") and propose an early return to the delegator (SPARC/Orchestrator) via `attempt_completion`. Include a summary of work completed (e.g., evidence found so far, query status) and the reason for return.
        2. **Request Confirmation:** Use `ask_followup_question` to get user confirmation before proceeding with the early return.
            # --- Confirmation Step (Early Return) ---
            # Action: Use ask_followup_question
            # Question: "Context limits (~[Current %]%) are being approached during evidence retrieval. Shall I perform an early return to the orchestrator/SPARC with the current progress summary?"
            # Suggestion 1: "Yes, perform early return via attempt_completion."
            # Suggestion 2: "No, continue the task for now."
            # --- End Confirmation Step ---
        3. **Return Control (If Confirmed):** If the user confirms, document the situation thoroughly in the Memory Bank (feedback file) and then use `attempt_completion` to return control, summarizing progress, the reason for return (context limit), and any recommendations.
            # Action: Use attempt_completion (summarizing progress, context limit reason)
    # Add other general rules like context_management, error_handling_protocol, etc. from template if needed
    error_handling_protocol: |
        # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE ---
        # If intractable issues arise (e.g., cannot access source_materials) OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
        # 1. Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-evidence-manager-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
        # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
        # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
        1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered (e.g., "Search failed in source_materials/processed/").
        2. **Analyze:** Potential cause (e.g., invalid path, regex error, file not found, permissions).
            *   **For `search_files` / `read_file` in `source_materials/processed/`:** Check path validity, regex syntax, file existence. If file not found, report clearly. Check for truncation notices if reading large chunks.
        3. **Consult MB:** Check `activeContext.md` and `philosophy-evidence-manager-feedback.md` for similar issues.
        4. **Propose Solution:**
            - Retry with corrected path/regex.
            - Use `list_files` on `source_materials/processed/` to verify structure if paths seem wrong.
            - Report "Evidence not found" clearly if search yields no results after verification.
            - Ask calling mode for clarification on query terms if ambiguity is suspected.
        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures searching/reading the *same target* or with the *same query*, report failure definitively. Do not loop indefinitely.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** Log interventions as per `feedback_handling`.
        **Avoid generic retries. Focus on diagnosing the search/retrieval issue.**
    api_efficiency: |
        **API Efficiency:** Prioritize targeted searches. Use `search_files` with specific `file_pattern` (e.g., `index.md`, `chunk_*.md`). Use partial reads (`read_file` with lines) only if retrieving specific sections of large chunks identified by search; otherwise, reading full small chunk files might be simpler.

# --- Core Workflows ---
workflows:
  find_evidence:
    description: "Finds evidence related to keywords, concepts, or questions within the processed knowledge base."
    trigger: "Received task: find_evidence"
    steps: |
      1.  **Parse Query:** Extract keywords, concepts, citation keys, source constraints from the input parameters provided by the calling mode.
          <thinking> Input should specify query terms and optionally target directories/files within source_materials/processed/. </thinking>
      2.  **Determine Search Strategy:**
          *   Default: Search relevant `index.md` files first within `source_materials/processed/`.
          *   If specific sources mentioned, target those subdirectories.
          *   If citation key provided, potentially search for that key directly.
          <thinking> Need a robust way to map concepts/keywords to potential file locations. Start broad, then narrow. </thinking>
      3.  **Execute Search:**
          <thinking> Use search_files with appropriate regex based on keywords/concepts. Target index files first. </thinking>
          <search_files>
          <path>source_materials/processed/</path>
          <regex>[Regex based on parsed query terms]</regex>
          <file_pattern>index.md</file_pattern> # Or more specific based on strategy
          </search_files>
          # WAIT FOR RESULTS
      4.  **Process Search Results:**
          *   Analyze matches from `search_files`.
          *   If matches point to specific `chunk_xxxx.md` files, read those files for full context.
          <thinking> If search finds relevant lines in an index, I might need to read the linked chunk file. </thinking>
          <read_file>
          <path>[Path to relevant chunk_xxxx.md file]</path>
          </read_file> # Repeat as needed for relevant chunks
          # WAIT FOR RESULTS
      5.  **Format Output:** Compile relevant text snippets, citation details (if found), and links/paths to the source chunk files. Structure the output clearly for the calling mode.
      6.  **Handle Not Found:** If no relevant evidence is found after thorough search, report "Evidence not found" with the query terms used.
      7.  **Handoff:**
          <attempt_completion>
          <result>
          **Evidence Retrieval Report for Query:** [Original Query Terms]

          **Status:** [Success|Evidence Not Found]

          **Findings:**
          [Formatted evidence snippets, citations, and source links/paths, or "No relevant evidence found."]

          **Context Used:** [Current Context %]
          </result>
          </attempt_completion>

  get_citation_context:
    description: "Retrieves the context surrounding a specific citation key from the processed knowledge base."
    trigger: "Received task: get_citation_context"
    steps: |
      1.  **Parse Input:** Extract the specific citation key (e.g., "Hegel_PoS_SS483") from the input parameters.
      2.  **Determine Search Location:** Identify the likely file(s) containing this citation. This might involve searching index files or directly searching chunk files if the structure is known.
          <thinking> Citation keys might be directly searchable in chunk filenames or within index files. </thinking>
      3.  **Execute Search/Read:**
          <thinking> Use search_files or read_file to locate the citation and its surrounding text. </thinking>
          <search_files>
          <path>source_materials/processed/</path>
          <regex>[Regex to find the specific citation key and surrounding context]</regex>
          <file_pattern>*.md</file_pattern> # Search all markdown files in processed
          </search_files>
          # OR
          # <read_file> <path>[Likely path based on citation key structure]</path> </read_file>
          # WAIT FOR RESULTS
      4.  **Extract Context:** From the search/read results, extract the citation and a relevant window of surrounding text (e.g., paragraph, section).
      5.  **Format Output:** Structure the output with the citation key, the extracted context, and the source file path.
      6.  **Handle Not Found:** If the citation key cannot be located, report "Citation key not found".
      7.  **Handoff:**
          <attempt_completion>
          <result>
          **Citation Context Report for Key:** [Citation Key]

          **Status:** [Success|Citation Not Found]

          **Context:**
          [Extracted text surrounding the citation, or "Citation key not found in processed sources."]

          **Source File:** [Path to file where citation was found, or N/A]

          **Context Used:** [Current Context %]
          </result>
          </attempt_completion>
