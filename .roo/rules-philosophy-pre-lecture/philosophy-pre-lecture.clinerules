  # Inherits standard Memory Bank strategy from central SPARC configuration.
  # Initialization, update triggers, and feedback handling are defined globally.
  # Mode-specific logs and feedback are stored in designated files.
  _comment: "Standard inheritance placeholder."

# --- 3.4 General Rules ---
general:
  # Inherits general rules (status prefix, context management, error handling) from central SPARC configuration.

  format: |
    ### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - [Action/Event Type]
    - **Details**: [Specific information about the action, e.g., KB IDs accessed, concepts identified, questions generated, errors encountered]
    - **Input Context**: [Brief reference to input data used, e.g., Reading KB ID, Lecture Topic]
    - **Output/Result**: [Brief reference to output, e.g., New KB Entry IDs, Status]
    - **Cross-References**: [Links to related MB entries, e.g., "[See KB Write YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]"]
  frequency:
    - Task Start/End (Received from Orchestrator / Returned to Orchestrator)
    - Input Readings/Scope Received (KB IDs/Paths, Lecture Context)
    - KB Queries Performed (Read operations: Target paths/IDs, Filters used)
    - Analysis Steps (Concept Identification, Argument Extraction, Passage Difficulty Assessment, Question Generation)
    - KB Entries Written (Write operations: Target paths/IDs, Entry types: Concept, Argument, Question)
    - Errors Encountered (During analysis, KB interaction, etc.)
  guidelines:
    - Log entries MUST be added in reverse chronological order (newest first).
    - Keep logs concise but informative, focusing on analysis actions and KB interactions.
    - Reference specific KB entry IDs or file paths when logging read/write operations.
    - Use consistent terminology for actions/events.

# --- 3.6 Error Reporting Protocols (Strict Protocol) ---
error_reporting_protocols:
  reporting_target: "Return structured error object to Orchestrator."
  error_codes:
    - KB_READ_FAIL: "Failed to read required data from Knowledge Base."
    - KB_WRITE_FAIL: "Failed to write analysis results to Knowledge Base."
    - KB_SCHEMA_VIOLATION: "Attempted KB write failed due to schema non-compliance (V18.3)."
    - ANALYSIS_ERROR: "Internal error during text analysis or interpretation."
    - INPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL: "Invalid or missing input parameters (e.g., reading KB IDs)."
    - CONFIG_LOAD_FAIL: "Failed to load necessary configuration or rules."
  error_message_format: |
    {
      "errorCode": "[ERROR_CODE]",
      "errorMessage": "[Detailed description of the error, including context if possible]",
      "sourceMode": "philosophy-pre-lecture",
      "timestamp": "[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]",
      "affectedResourceId": "[KB ID, file path, or N/A]"
    }
  logging:
    - All errors MUST be logged to the operational log (`memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-pre-lecture.md`).
    - All errors MUST also be logged to the mode-specific feedback log (`memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-pre-lecture-feedback.md`) for review and potential system improvement.
  escalation:
    - Adheres to the standard SPARC error handling and escalation procedures defined globally. Orchestrator determines retry/delegation strategy.

# --- 5.4 KB Interaction Protocols (Archetype B - Strict Protocol) ---

      description: "Create new 'Question' entries related to the reading."
      tools: ["write_to_file"]
  write_guidelines:
    - **Strict Schema Adherence:** All writes MUST conform strictly to the V18.3 KB schema definitions for the respective entry type (Concept, Argument, Question).
    - **Rigor Fields:** MUST populate all required rigor fields (e.g., `definition_clarity`, `evidence_link_strength`, `source_ref_keys`, `extraction_markers`, `timestamp`, `author_mode`).
    - **Unique IDs:** MUST generate unique, collision-resistant IDs for all new entries (e.g., `concept-[timestamp]-[hash]`).
    - **Linking:** MUST populate linking fields (`source_ref_keys`, `related_ids`) to connect new entries to source texts and potentially related existing KB entries.
  querying:
    - Before creating new Concept or Argument entries, use `search_files` or targeted `read_file` operations with context tags (e.g., author, work, topic) and `related_ids` from source chunks to identify potentially relevant existing entries. Prioritize linking over duplication.
  kb_doctor_interaction:
    - Reports potential KB inconsistencies encountered during read/write operations (e.g., failed schema validation on write attempt, discovery of conflicting concepts/arguments during reads) to the orchestrator via the standard error reporting mechanism (`KB_SCHEMA_VIOLATION` or custom code). Does not directly invoke KB Doctor.

# --- 5.5 Conceptual Determinacy (Archetype B - Guideline) ---
conceptual_determinacy:
  guidelines:
    - **Clarity:** Strive to define identified concepts with clear positive determinations (what the concept *is*).
    - **Contrast:** Where helpful, provide negative determinations (what the concept *is not*) or contrast with ordinary language usage to enhance precision.
    - **Ambiguity:** Explicitly identify and flag any ambiguities or vagueness related to key concepts found within the pre-lecture reading material. Document these in the analysis summary and potentially generate specific KB 'Question' entries about them.
    - **Linking:** Ensure all conceptual analysis is linked back to specific text passages (`source_ref_keys`, `extraction_markers`).
  requirements:
    positive_definition: required
    negative_definition: recommended # Recommended for core concepts or where ambiguity exists
    ordinary_language_contrast: optional # Use when beneficial for clarity
    disambiguation_protocol: required_if_ambiguous # Must flag and potentially generate questions if ambiguity is detected

# --- 5.6 Evidence Standards (Archetype B - Guideline + Strict Workflow) ---
evidence_standards:
  requirements:
    - **Direct Linking:** All generated KB entries (Concepts, Arguments, Questions) MUST be directly linked to the specific source text chunk(s) they were derived from using `source_ref_keys` (pointing to the source chunk KB ID) and `extraction_markers` (indicating the specific text passage/lines).
    - **Traceability:** Ensure the `author_mode` field in created KB entries is set to `philosophy-pre-lecture`.
  verification_workflow:
    enabled: false
    # Verification of the analysis quality and evidence linkage is typically handled
    # by a separate mode (e.g., philosophy-verification-agent) later in the workflow.
    # This mode focuses on initial generation based on direct reading.

# --- 5.7 Rigor and Bias Mitigation (Archetype B) ---
rigor_and_bias_mitigation:
  guidelines:
    - **Focus on Text:** Base analysis primarily on the provided text, minimizing external assumptions or interpretations not directly supported by the reading.
    - **Acknowledge Difficulty:** Explicitly note passages identified as potentially difficult or open to multiple interpretations.
    - **Schema Adherence:** Strict adherence to the KB schema's rigor fields serves as a primary mechanism for maintaining structured and traceable analysis.
    - **Feedback Loop:** Utilize feedback from downstream modes (Verification, Class Analysis) via the feedback log (`memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-pre-lecture-feedback.md`) to refine analysis techniques.
