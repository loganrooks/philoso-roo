  if_no_memory_bank: |
    # Standard Protocol if No Memory Bank Found (V2.5)
    1. Inform User: "No Memory Bank found at `phil-memory-bank/`..."
    2. Conditional Actions: Offer switch to Architect to create MB structure or proceed in [MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE] state.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
    # Standard Protocol if Memory Bank Exists (V2.5)
    1. Read Global & Active Files: `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `phil-memory-bank/globalContext.md` (WAIT after each)
    2. Read Mode-Specific & Feedback: `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-citation-manager.md`, `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-citation-manager-feedback.md` (WAIT after each, if exists)
    3. Activation: Set status '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]', inform user, apply feedback. **Verify reverse chronological order of logs.**
  update_frequency: |
    # Standard Memory Bank Update Frequency (V2.5)
    UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
    1. At the beginning of each task (read)
    2. **Before calling attempt_completion (perform MANDATORY pre-completion checks: Verification: Ensure the `attempt_completion` message provides a *detailed* summary including: 1) Specific actions taken, 2) Files/resources affected (with paths), 3) Verification steps performed (doc accuracy), 4) Clear status/next steps. The summary must be sufficient for Philoso-Roo System/user validation without needing to re-read extensive logs. Then write MB updates using batch operations)**
    3. When significant new information is discovered or decisions are made
    4. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
    # Standard Memory Bank Update Process (V2.5)
    1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure. **ALWAYS add new entries to the TOP (reverse chronological order).** Use insert_content/apply_diff appropriately (prefer batching). Avoid overwriting logs, keep concise. Minimize API calls.
    2. File-Specific Updates: Update `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md` (using standard format) and relevant sections in `phil-memory-bank/globalContext.md`. Update `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-citation-manager.md` under appropriate headers (**newest first**). Cross-reference if needed.
  feedback_handling: |
    # Standard Feedback Handling Process (V2.5)
    Save feedback to `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-citation-manager-feedback.md` (**newest first**), document source/issue/action, apply learnings. **IMMEDIATELY log user interventions, explicit corrections, or significant deviations from instructions using the format in the mode-specific Intervention Log (if applicable) or within the feedback file. Include: Trigger, Context, Action Taken, Rationale, Outcome, Follow-up.**

general:
  status_prefix: |
    # Standard Status Prefix Rule (V2.5)
    "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
  context_management: |
    # Standard Context Management Rule (V2.5)
    **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
  error_handling_protocol: |
    # Standard Error Handling Protocol (V2.5)
    # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
    # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
    # 1. Document Thoroughly in `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-citation-manager-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
    # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
    # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

    **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
    1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
    2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
        *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
        *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying. If `apply_diff` fails with a context mismatch or low similarity: 1. Re-read the target file section using `read_file` with `start_line`/`end_line`. 2. Compare the expected `SEARCH` block with the actual content read. 3. If different, adjust the `SEARCH` block and retry `apply_diff`. 4. If identical, investigate other causes (tool bug?) and consider alternative tools (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`) or escalate per 'Three Strikes' rule.
    3. **Consult MB:** Check `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
    4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
        - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
        - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
        - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
        - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
    5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
    6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
    **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
  error_handling: |
    # Standard Memory Bank Error Handling Rule (V2.5)
    **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
    1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
    2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
    3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]' if context is severely compromised.
    4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
    5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
  critical_evaluation: |
    # Standard Critical Evaluation Rule (V2.5)
    **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.

operational_context_protocols:
  write_access: "Modes MUST write operational logs ONLY to their designated `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-citation-manager.md` file using `insert_content` (reverse chrono) or `apply_diff` (targeted updates). Batching recommended."

    # V18.3.6 Direct Read Pattern
    1. Iterate through `reference_kb_ids` from input.
    2. Construct the full path: `philosophy-knowledge-base/references/[KB_REF_ID].md`.
    3. Use `read_file` tool to retrieve content for each required reference file.
    4. Parse the YAML frontmatter and Markdown content of the retrieved file.
    5. Handle `read_file` errors (file not found -> REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND, other read error -> KB_READ_FAIL).
    6. Handle parsing errors (malformed content -> FORMATTING_ERROR).
    7. If deeper context is needed (e.g., to verify an extraction marker or understand the source of a quotation within the reference):
        a. Use `source_ref_keys` from the KB Reference entry to find the `source_id`. (This might involve looking up the Reference entry itself if it contains the `source_id`, or the `source_id` might be part of the `source_ref_key` format).
        b. Consult `source_materials/processed/master_index.json` using the `source_id` to get the `path_to_index` for that material.
        c. Read the material-specific `index.md` (e.g., `source_materials/processed/[path_from_master_index_to_material_dir]/index.md`) using the `path_to_index`.
        d. Use `extraction_markers` from the reference's YAML and the chunk structure information from the material's `index.md` to locate and read the specific chunk file within `source_materials/processed/[path_from_master_index_to_material_dir]/chunks/` using `read_file`.
  kb_maintenance_interaction: |
    # V18.3.6: Report issues to Orchestrator, do not trigger directly.
    - If `read_file` fails for a requested `reference_kb_id`, report `REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` or `KB_READ_FAIL` to Orchestrator via standard error reporting.
    - If parsing fails due to suspected malformed content in a reference file, report `FORMATTING_ERROR` to Orchestrator, including the KB_REF_ID and specific parsing issue. Suggest MetaReflector/VerificationAgent review.
    - If navigation or reading of `source_materials/processed/` fails (e.g., missing index, broken links, unreadable chunk), report `SOURCE_MATERIAL_NAV_ERROR` to Orchestrator.
