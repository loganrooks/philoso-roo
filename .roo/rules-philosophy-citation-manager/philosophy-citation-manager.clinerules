# memory_bank_strategy: Fully explicit based on standard SPARC rules (V1)
memory_bank_strategy:
  initialization: |
      # Standard SPARC Initialization (Explicit)
      # 1. Check for memory-bank directory existence.
      # 2. If exists, read standard files (activeContext.md, globalContext.md, mode-specific/[slug].md, feedback/[slug]-feedback.md) using read_file sequentially, waiting for confirmation. Handle read failures gracefully (log, inform, consider INACTIVE state).
      # 3. Review recent feedback entries for relevant learnings.
      # 4. Set status to [MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE] and inform user.
      # 5. If no memory-bank, inform user and offer creation (delegating to architect if agreed), otherwise proceed as [MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE].
      # NOTE: This mode follows the standard procedure unless overridden by task instructions (like the current task).
  update_process: |
      # Standard SPARC Update Process (Explicit)
      # 1. Add new entries to the TOP (reverse chronological order) of relevant MB files (activeContext.md, globalContext.md, mode-specific log).
      # 2. Use insert_content or apply_diff (prefer batching).
      # 3. Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure. Keep concise.
      # 4. Cross-reference related MB entries using timestamps or IDs.
      # 5. Update MB before calling attempt_completion (perform pre-completion checks), on significant events/changes, user interventions, or explicit UMB command.
  feedback_handling: |
      # Standard SPARC Feedback Handling (Explicit)
      # 1. Save feedback/interventions to `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-citation-manager-feedback.md` (newest first).
      # 2. Document trigger, context, action, rationale, outcome, follow-up.
      # 3. Log ALL user interventions IMMEDIATELY before proceeding.
      # 4. Apply learnings to current/future tasks.

# general: Fully explicit based on standard SPARC rules (V1)
general:
  status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
  context_management: |
      # Standard SPARC Context Management (Explicit)
      # Proactively monitor context window size. If approaching limits (~40-50%) or observing degraded performance, suggest using `new_task` for delegation with a clear handover, explicitly stating context concerns. For non-orchestrator modes, this involves requesting permission to return control to the delegator via `attempt_completion` with a detailed status and rationale (Early Return).
  error_handling_protocol: |
      # Standard SPARC Structured Error Handling (Explicit)
      # 1. Log: Clearly state the error encountered in chat and operational/feedback logs.
      # 2. Analyze: Briefly analyze potential cause (params, file access, API, context mismatch). Check tool docs/schema.
      #    - read_file: Check for truncation notice. If found and full context needed, re-read with lines or ask user.
      #    - apply_diff: Check for context mismatch or identical content errors first. Suggest re-read/search before retry.
      # 3. Consult MB: Check activeContext.md, mode-specific logs for similar issues.
      # 4. Propose Solution: Specific next step (retry corrected, different tool, ask user, delegate to debug).
      # 5. "Three Strikes" Rule: After 2-3 consecutive failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate strategy change (alternative tool, research, ask, debug, Early Return). Forbid simple retries.
      # 6. Intervention Handling: Log user interventions per `feedback_handling` *before* proceeding.
      # Avoid generic retries or asking "What should I do?" without analysis.
  error_handling: |
      # Standard SPARC Memory Bank Error Handling (Explicit)
      # If any Memory Bank operation (list_files, read_file, insert_content, apply_diff) fails:
      # 1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
      # 2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
      # 3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]` if context is severely compromised.
      # 4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
      # 5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
  critical_evaluation: |
      # Standard SPARC Critical Evaluation (Explicit)
      # Rule: Critical Evaluation. When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.
  api_efficiency: |
      # Standard SPARC API Efficiency (Explicit)
      # Prioritize minimizing API calls. Use batch operations (multi-block apply_diff, multi-op insert_content). Prefer partial reads (read_file with start/end lines) for large files (>500 lines) unless full context is explicitly justified in <thinking>. Justify need for full context (e.g., global search, diff application). Use search_files or larger reads to relocate context if line numbers shift.
  task_reception: |
      # Standard SPARC Task Reception (Explicit)
      # When receiving a task via `new_task`, carefully review objective, context (check MB links), and deliverables. Use `ask_followup_question` to clarify with SPARC *before* starting significant work if needed.

    # V18.3 Direct Read Pattern
    1. Iterate through `reference_kb_ids` from input.
    2. Construct the full path: `philosophy-knowledge-base/references/[KB_REF_ID].md`.
    3. Use `read_file` tool to retrieve content for each required reference file.
    4. Parse the YAML frontmatter and Markdown content of the retrieved file.
    5. Handle `read_file` errors (file not found -> REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND, other read error -> KB_READ_FAIL).
    6. Handle parsing errors (malformed content -> FORMATTING_ERROR).
  kb_doctor_interaction: |
    # V18.3: Report issues to Orchestrator, do not trigger directly.
    - If `read_file` fails for a requested `reference_kb_id`, report `REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` or `KB_READ_FAIL` to Orchestrator via standard error reporting.
    - If parsing fails due to suspected malformed content in a reference file, report `FORMATTING_ERROR` to Orchestrator, including the KB_REF_ID and specific parsing issue. Suggest KB Doctor review.

# Mode-Specific Logic

  purpose: "Defines the rules and process for formatting citations and generating bibliographies based on Knowledge Base reference entries."
  format: |
    ```markdown
    # Citation Formatting and Bibliography Generation Rules

    ## 1. Supported Citation Styles
    - Currently supported styles: "Chicago" (Chicago Manual of Style, 17th Edition, Notes and Bibliography system), "MLA" (Modern Language Association, 9th Edition).
    - Style determined by `citation_style` input.
    - Report `CITATION_STYLE_INVALID` for unsupported styles.

    ## 2. Citation Placeholder Format
    - Input `draft_content` uses `[cite:KB_REF_ID]`.
    - `KB_REF_ID` matches filename in `philosophy-knowledge-base/references/`.

    ## 3. Formatting Process
    1.  **Parse Draft:** Identify all `[cite:KB_REF_ID]` placeholders.
    2.  **Retrieve References:** For each unique `KB_REF_ID`:
        *   Read `philosophy-knowledge-base/references/KB_REF_ID.md` using `read_file`.
        *   Handle read failures (report `REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` or `KB_READ_FAIL`).
        *   Parse reference file content (YAML frontmatter/Markdown). Handle parsing failures (report `FORMATTING_ERROR`).
    3.  **Format Citations:** Based on `citation_style` and parsed data, format the citation (footnote/parenthetical).
    4.  **Replace Placeholders:** Replace `[cite:KB_REF_ID]` with formatted citation. Handle repeats per style guide (e.g., Ibid., shortened forms).

    ## 4. Bibliography Generation
    1.  **Collect Entries:** Gather parsed data for all successfully retrieved references.
    2.  **Sort Entries:** Sort alphabetically by author/title per `citation_style`.
    3.  **Format Entries:** Format each entry per bibliography/works cited style.
    4.  **Assemble Bibliography:** Combine entries into a single string with heading ("Bibliography" or "Works Cited").

    ## 5. Error Handling
    - Halt gracefully on critical failures (KB read, parsing, formatting).
    - Log error following `operational_logging` and `error_reporting_protocols`.
    - Return `failure` status with `error_details` to Orchestrator.
