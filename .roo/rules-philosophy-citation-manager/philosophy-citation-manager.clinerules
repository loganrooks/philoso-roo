  logging: |
    - All errors MUST be logged to the operational log (`memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-citation-manager.md`) with ERROR level.
    - All errors MUST also be logged to the mode-specific feedback log (`memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-citation-manager-feedback.md`) for analysis and improvement.
  escalation: |
    - Follow standard SPARC error handling procedures. Report structured error to Orchestrator. Await instructions or attempt recovery based on Orchestrator guidance if applicable.

  querying: |
    - Reads specific reference entry files (e.g., `philosophy-knowledge-base/references/KB_REF_ID.md`) based on the `reference_kb_ids` provided in the input schema.
    - Uses the `read_file` tool to retrieve the content of each required reference file.
    - Handles potential `read_file` errors (e.g., file not found) and reports them using `REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` or `KB_READ_FAIL` error codes.
  kb_doctor_interaction: |
    - Reports potential KB inconsistencies found during read operations to the orchestrator via the error reporting mechanism.
    - Specifically, if a `read_file` operation fails for a requested `reference_kb_id`, report `REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` (if file doesn't exist) or `KB_READ_FAIL` (if file exists but cannot be read).
    - May identify malformed content within a successfully read file during parsing; report via `FORMATTING_ERROR` or a more specific code if defined, including context in `errorDetails`.

    # Citation Formatting and Bibliography Generation Rules

    ## 1. Supported Citation Styles
    - Currently supported styles: "Chicago" (Chicago Manual of Style, 17th Edition, Notes and Bibliography system), "MLA" (Modern Language Association, 9th Edition).
    - The specific style is determined by the `citation_style` input parameter.
    - If an unsupported style is requested, a `CITATION_STYLE_INVALID` error must be reported.

    ## 2. Citation Placeholder Format
    - Input `draft_content` must use placeholders in the format `[cite:KB_REF_ID]`.
    - `KB_REF_ID` corresponds to the filename (without extension) of a reference entry in `philosophy-knowledge-base/references/`.

    ## 3. Formatting Process
    1.  **Parse Draft:** Identify all `[cite:KB_REF_ID]` placeholders in the `draft_content`.
    2.  **Retrieve References:** For each unique `KB_REF_ID` found:
        *   Attempt to read the corresponding file: `philosophy-knowledge-base/references/KB_REF_ID.md` using `read_file`.
        *   If reading fails (file not found or unreadable), report `REFERENCE_NOT_FOUND` or `KB_READ_FAIL` and halt processing for that citation (or potentially the entire task, depending on error handling strategy).
        *   Parse the content of the reference file (assuming a structured format like YAML frontmatter or specific Markdown sections for author, title, year, publisher, etc.). If parsing fails due to malformed content, report `FORMATTING_ERROR`.
    3.  **Format Citations:** Based on the `citation_style` and the parsed data from the reference file, format the citation (e.g., footnote for Chicago, parenthetical for MLA).
    4.  **Replace Placeholders:** Replace each `[cite:KB_REF_ID]` placeholder in the `draft_content` with its corresponding formatted citation. Handle repeated citations according to the style guide (e.g., "Ibid." for Chicago, shortened forms).

    ## 4. Bibliography Generation
    1.  **Collect Entries:** Gather the parsed data for all *successfully* retrieved and formatted reference entries (`KB_REF_ID`s).
    2.  **Sort Entries:** Sort the reference entries alphabetically by author's last name (or title if no author) according to the rules of the specified `citation_style`.
    3.  **Format Entries:** Format each entry according to the bibliography/works cited format of the `citation_style`.
    4.  **Assemble Bibliography:** Combine the formatted entries into a single string, typically with a heading like "Bibliography" or "Works Cited".

    ## 5. Error Handling
    - If any critical step fails (e.g., KB read, parsing essential fields, formatting), the process should halt gracefully, log the error, and return a `failure` status with appropriate `error_details`.
