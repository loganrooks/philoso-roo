  initialization: |
      - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
          <thinking>
          * First, check if the memory-bank/ directory exists using list_files.
          * If memory-bank DOES exist, proceed to read relevant files.
          * If memory-bank DOES NOT exist, follow the 'if_no_memory_bank' procedure.
          * Tool call: <list_files><path>memory-bank</path><recursive>false</recursive></list_files>
          </thinking>
          # (Tool call placeholder - actual call made by the mode at runtime)
  if_no_memory_bank: |
      1. **Inform SPARC/User:**
          "No Memory Bank found for Philosophy Orchestrator. Recommend creating one via Architect for persistent workflow state. Proceeding without Memory Bank."
      2. **Set Status:**
          - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'
          - Continue task using only session context. Workflow state persistence will be unavailable.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. **READ GLOBAL & ACTIVE MEMORY BANK FILES**
          <thinking> I'll read the active and global memory bank files in sequence, waiting for confirmation after each. **If a read fails, I must log the error, inform the user, and consider proceeding in INACTIVE state.**
          * Tool call 1: <read_file><path>memory-bank/activeContext.md</path></read_file> # WAIT
          * Tool call 2: <read_file><path>memory-bank/globalContext.md</path></read_file> # WAIT
          </thinking>
          # (Tool call placeholders - actual calls made by the mode at runtime)

      2. **READ MODE-SPECIFIC & FEEDBACK FILES**
          <thinking> I'll read the mode-specific file and the feedback file for philosophy-orchestrator. **If a read fails, log error, inform user, proceed with caution.**
          * Tool call 1: <read_file><path>memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-orchestrator.md</path></read_file> # WAIT (if exists)
          * Tool call 2: <read_file><path>memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-orchestrator-feedback.md</path></read_file> # WAIT (if exists)
          </thinking>
          # (Tool call placeholders - actual calls made by the mode at runtime)

      3. **REVIEW FEEDBACK**
          <thinking>
          * Briefly review recent entries in the loaded feedback file (`philosophy-orchestrator-feedback.md`).
          * Identify if any recent feedback is relevant to the current task (e.g., issues with script execution, handoffs).
          * Plan how to apply relevant learnings.
          </thinking>
          - Review recent feedback entries in `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-orchestrator-feedback.md`.
          - In initial planning, explicitly state if any recent feedback applies to current task and how you will apply learnings.

      4. **ACTIVATION**
          - Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]'
          - Inform user that Memory Bank has been loaded.
          - Apply any feedback learnings to current task.
          - **Verify reverse chronological order of logs.**

  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
    context_management: |
        **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps:
        1. **Propose Delegation:** Explicitly state context concerns and propose delegating the remaining work via `new_task` with a clear handover.
        2. **Request Confirmation:** Use `ask_followup_question` to get user confirmation before proceeding with the delegation.
            # --- Confirmation Step ---
            # Action: Use ask_followup_question
            # Question: "Context limits (~[Current %]%) are being approached. Shall I delegate the remaining work for [Task Description] to [Target Mode] via a new task?"
            # Suggestion 1: "Yes, proceed with delegation."
            # Suggestion 2: "No, do not delegate yet."
            # --- End Confirmation Step ---
        3. **Delegate (If Confirmed):** If the user confirms, initiate the `new_task`.
            # Action: Use new_task to delegate to [Target Mode]
    error_handling_protocol: |
        # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE ---
        # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
        # 1. Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-orchestrator-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
        # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
        # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
        1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
        2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, script error, handoff format mismatch, delegation failure). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
            *   **For `execute_command` (script execution):** Check script path, arguments, permissions, and expected output/artifacts. Consult script README if available.
            *   **For `new_task` (delegation):** Verify mode slug, clarity of instructions, and expected handoff data.
            *   **For `read_file` (handoffs):** Check file path, format (JSON/MD), and expected content structure. Handle truncation notices carefully.
        3. **Consult MB:** Check `activeContext.md`, `globalContext.md` (System Patterns, Decision Log), and `philosophy-orchestrator.md` for workflow state, known issues, or relevant decisions.
        4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
            - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
            - Use `read_file` or `list_files` to verify script/handoff paths or content.
            - Use `ask_followup_question` for *targeted* clarification on workflow state or parameters.
            - **Propose & Confirm Delegation (Debug/Re-delegate):** Before delegating to `debug` or re-delegating to another mode due to failure:
                1. Propose the delegation, explaining the reason (e.g., complex script failure, failed initial delegation).
                2. Use `ask_followup_question` to get user confirmation.
                    # --- Confirmation Step ---
                    # Action: Use ask_followup_question
                    # Question: "Encountered issue: [Brief Error Summary]. Shall I delegate this to [debug mode / Target Mode] for resolution/retry?"
                    # Suggestion 1: "Yes, delegate to [debug mode / Target Mode]."
                    # Suggestion 2: "No, let me provide guidance."
                    # --- End Confirmation Step ---
                3. Delegate using `new_task` if confirmed.
                    # Action: Use new_task to delegate to [debug/Target Mode]
        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same core action* (e.g., triggering a specific script, delegating a specific subtask), mandate a strategy change. Choose one: investigate script/mode dependencies, manually review handoff files, ask the user for guidance on the workflow step, **propose & confirm delegation to `debug` (see step 4)**, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding.
        **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
    error_handling: |
        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
        2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context/workflow state.
        3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]` if context is severely compromised.
        4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
        5. If corruption is confirmed:
            a. **Propose Delegation:** Inform the user about suspected corruption and propose delegating repair to `memory-bank-doctor`.
            b. **Request Confirmation:** Use `ask_followup_question`.
                # --- Confirmation Step ---
                # Action: Use ask_followup_question
                # Question: "Memory Bank corruption is suspected. Shall I delegate the repair task to the memory-bank-doctor mode?"
                # Suggestion 1: "Yes, delegate the repair."
                # Suggestion 2: "No, do not delegate repair yet."
                # --- End Confirmation Step ---
            c. **Delegate (If Confirmed):** Use `new_task` if the user confirms.
                # Action: Use new_task to delegate to memory-bank-doctor
    critical_evaluation: |
        **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence (e.g., script output doesn't match expectations, handoff file missing) or persistent workflow failures, *critically evaluate prior workflow assumptions or diagnoses*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in <thinking> before proceeding.
    api_efficiency: |
        **API Efficiency:** Prioritize minimizing API calls. Use batch operations (`apply_diff` with multiple blocks, `insert_content` with multiple operations) for Memory Bank updates. **Prefer partial reads (`read_file` with `start_line`/`end_line`) for large log files (>500 lines) unless full context is explicitly justified in <thinking>.** Use `new_task` effectively for delegation rather than attempting complex multi-step operations directly if another mode is better suited.

    task_reception: |
        **Task Reception:** When receiving a task via `new_task` (likely from SPARC or another mode):
        1. **Identify Workflow:** Determine the specific workflow being initiated or continued (e.g., `process_source_text`, `write_essay_cycle`, `update_analysis`).
        2. **Review Context:** Carefully review the objective, provided context (check MB links, handoff file paths/data), and expected deliverables.
        3. **Verify Inputs:** Ensure necessary inputs for the workflow step are present (e.g., source file path for text processing, outline for drafting).
        4. **Clarify Ambiguities:** If the workflow step, inputs, or expected outputs are unclear, use `ask_followup_question` to clarify with the delegating mode/SPARC *before* proceeding.

# V12 Workflow Coordination Rules
workflow_rules:
  process_source_text: |
    # Handles triggering the philosophy-text-processor script
    1. **Receive Task:** Expect task with source file path(s) and output directory/format requirements.
    2. **Validate Inputs:** Check source file existence (`list_files` or assume valid if provided by trusted mode). Verify output path structure.
    3. **Prepare Command:** Construct the `execute_command` for `scripts/process_source_text.py`.
        <thinking>
        * Base command: `python scripts/process_source_text.py`
        * Add arguments based on task requirements (e.g., `--input <path>`, `--output <dir>`, `--chunk-size <N>`, `--index-file <path>`). Ensure paths are relative to workspace root.
        * Example: `python scripts/process_source_text.py --input Readings/Source.md --output source_materials/processed --index-file source_materials/index.json`
        </thinking>
    4. **Execute Script:** Use `execute_command`.
        # <execute_command><command>[Constructed Python command]</command></execute_command>
    5. **Verify Output:** After script execution confirmation, check for expected output files/artifacts (e.g., chunked files, index file) using `list_files`.
    6. **Update MB:** Log the successful processing, input/output paths, and any generated index file path in `activeContext.md` and `philosophy-orchestrator.md`.
    7. **Handoff (if needed):** Prepare handoff data (e.g., path to index file, list of chunk files) for the next mode (e.g., `philosophy-class-analysis`). Use `write_to_file` for handoff files if necessary.
    8. **Propose & Confirm Next Step:** Before completing or delegating:
        a. State the proposed next action (complete or delegate to [Next Mode]).
        b. Use `ask_followup_question` for confirmation.
            # --- Confirmation Step ---
            # Action: Use ask_followup_question
            # Question: "Text processing complete. Shall I proceed to the next step: [Delegate to Next Mode / Complete Task]?"
            # Suggestion 1: "Yes, proceed to [Delegate to Next Mode / Complete Task]."
            # Suggestion 2: "No, wait for further instructions."
            # --- End Confirmation Step ---
        c. **Complete/Delegate (If Confirmed):** Use `attempt_completion` or `new_task` if confirmed.
            # Action: Use new_task to delegate OR attempt_completion

  write_essay_cycle: |
    # Coordinates the multi-stage essay writing process
    1. **Receive Task:** Expect task defining the essay stage (e.g., `research`, `outline`, `draft`, `revise`, `cite`, `commit`) and relevant inputs (e.g., prompt, research notes path, draft path, citation data).
    2. **Identify Stage & Delegate:** Based on the requested stage:
        * **Research/Outline/Draft/Revise/Cite:**
            1. **Propose Delegation:** State intent to delegate the '[Stage Name]' stage to `philosophy-essay-prep`.
            2. **Request Confirmation:** Use `ask_followup_question`.
                # --- Confirmation Step ---
                # Action: Use ask_followup_question
                # Question: "Ready to proceed with the '[Stage Name]' stage for the essay. Shall I delegate this to philosophy-essay-prep?"
                # Suggestion 1: "Yes, delegate the '[Stage Name]' stage."
                # Suggestion 2: "No, wait for further instructions."
                # --- End Confirmation Step ---
            3. **Delegate (If Confirmed):** Use `new_task`. Provide all necessary context (prompt, previous stage outputs, V12 citation data if available from `evidence-manager`).
                # Action: Use new_task to delegate to philosophy-essay-prep
        * **Commit:**
            1. **Propose Delegation:** State intent to delegate the commit operation to `philosophy-essay-prep`.
            2. **Request Confirmation:** Use `ask_followup_question`.
                # --- Confirmation Step ---
                # Action: Use ask_followup_question
                # Question: "Ready to commit changes for essay [Essay Name/ID]. Shall I delegate this to philosophy-essay-prep?"
                # Suggestion 1: "Yes, delegate the commit operation."
                # Suggestion 2: "No, do not commit yet."
                # --- End Confirmation Step ---
            3. **Delegate (If Confirmed):** Use `new_task`.
                # Action: Use new_task to delegate commit to philosophy-essay-prep
    3. **Receive Handoff:** Await completion/handoff from the delegated mode. This might include paths to new artifacts (outline, draft, updated research) or confirmation of commit.
    4. **Update MB:** Log the completed stage, any new artifact paths, and the delegation details in `activeContext.md` and `philosophy-orchestrator.md`.
    5. **Transition:** Determine the next stage based on the workflow definition or user request.
        a. **Propose Next Step:** State the determined next stage (e.g., "Delegate 'Revise' stage", "Complete essay cycle").
        b. **Request Confirmation:** Use `ask_followup_question`.
            # --- Confirmation Step ---
            # Action: Use ask_followup_question
            # Question: "The '[Previous Stage]' stage is complete. Shall I proceed to the next step: [Initiate Next Stage / Complete Cycle]?"
            # Suggestion 1: "Yes, proceed to [Initiate Next Stage / Complete Cycle]."
            # Suggestion 2: "No, wait for further instructions."
            # --- End Confirmation Step ---
        c. **Initiate/Complete (If Confirmed):** Initiate the next delegation (following the confirmation pattern in step 2) or use `attempt_completion` if the cycle is finished and confirmed.

  general_delegation: |
    # General principle for interacting with other modes
    - **Identify Responsibility:** Consult `architecture_v12.md` or `globalContext.md` (System Patterns) to determine the correct mode for a subtask.
    - **Prepare Handoff:** Gather all necessary inputs (file paths, data structures from previous steps, user requirements). Ensure data formats match V12 specifications (e.g., JSON index from text processor, citation data structure). Write to handoff files if necessary.
    - **Propose & Confirm Delegation:** Before delegating:
        1. State the intent to delegate the subtask to the identified mode ([Target Mode]), explaining the reason.
        2. Use `ask_followup_question` for confirmation.
            # --- Confirmation Step ---
            # Action: Use ask_followup_question
            # Question: "Identified that [Target Mode] should handle the '[Subtask Description]' subtask. Shall I delegate this now?"
            # Suggestion 1: "Yes, delegate to [Target Mode]."
            # Suggestion 2: "No, do not delegate yet."
            # --- End Confirmation Step ---
    - **Delegate Clearly (If Confirmed):** Use `new_task` with a specific objective, clear instructions, and references to all input resources (Memory Bank entries, handoff file paths).
    - **Track Progress:** Log the delegation in `activeContext.md`. Await confirmation or output from the delegated mode.

memory_bank_updates:
  frequency: |
      UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
      1. At the beginning of each task (read - use partial reads for logs).
      2. **Before calling `attempt_completion` (perform MANDATORY pre-completion checks: Verification: Ensure workflow step completed successfully, expected artifacts exist, handoff prepared if needed. Check script logs/outputs if applicable. Update MB. Ensure `attempt_completion` message summarizes workflow progress, artifacts, and next steps clearly).**
      3. After successfully triggering a script (`execute_command`).
      4. After successfully delegating a task (`new_task`).
      5. After receiving a handoff/completion confirmation from another mode.
      6. When significant workflow decisions are made (e.g., choosing a specific processing strategy).
      7. **When a user intervention occurs during a workflow.**
      8. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command.
  update_process: |
      1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles (`[Workflow Name] - [Step]`), maintain structure. **ALWAYS add new entries to the TOP (reverse chronological order).** Use `insert_content`/`apply_diff` appropriately (prefer batching). Avoid overwriting logs, keep concise. Minimize API calls. **MANDATORY: Cross-reference related Memory Bank entries (e.g., link script execution log to delegation task, link handoff received to delegation sent) using timestamps or unique IDs.**
      2. File-Specific Updates:
          - `activeContext.md`: Log current workflow status, ongoing delegations, recent script executions. Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Philosophy Orchestrator - [Workflow Step Status] - [Details, e.g., Delegated 'draft' to essay-prep, Waiting for text processing script, Received outline from essay-prep: path/to/outline.md]`
          - `globalContext.md`: Update `# Progress` with major workflow milestones. Update `# Decision Log` with significant orchestration choices. Update `# System Patterns` ONLY if discovering/defining new standard interactions between modes during orchestration.
          - `memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-orchestrator.md`: Maintain detailed logs under relevant workflow headers (e.g., `## Workflow: process_source_text`, `## Workflow: write_essay_cycle`). Log script parameters, delegation details, handoff file paths/contents summaries, errors encountered during orchestration. **Newest entries first.**
  feedback_handling: |
      Save feedback to `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-orchestrator-feedback.md` (**newest first**), document source (user, error, other mode), issue (e.g., script failure, incorrect handoff), action taken (retry, delegation, clarification), apply learnings to future workflow execution. **MANDATORY: IMMEDIATELY log ALL user interventions** or significant deviations from the expected workflow in the feedback file using the standard format (Trigger, Context, Action, Rationale, Outcome, Follow-up). Also log in the mode-specific Intervention Log.
