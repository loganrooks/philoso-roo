# --- 3.4 General Rules ---
# Inherits general operational rules (status prefix, context management, error handling, API efficiency, task reception)
# defined in the global or SPARC rules.
# See docs/standards/clinerules_standard_v1.md Section 3.4
general:
  # status_prefix, context_management, error_handling_protocol, error_handling, api_efficiency, task_reception inherited.
  # Orchestrator-specific error handling might involve retrying delegation or escalating failure.
  error_handling_protocol: |
    # Inherits base protocol, adding orchestration-specific handling:
    # If a delegated task via `new_task` fails:
    # 1. Log the failure in Orchestrator MB (Delegation Log, Active Workflows).
    # 2. Analyze the failure reason provided by the target mode or SPARC.
    # 3. Consult Orchestrator MB for similar past failures.
    # 4. Propose Solution:
    #    - Retry delegation (if transient error suspected).
    #    - Delegate to a different mode (if original mode inappropriate).
    #    - Delegate to `philosophy-debugger` or `debug` if cause is unclear.
    #    - Adjust the workflow sequence.
    #    - Ask user for clarification/guidance via `ask_followup_question`.
    #    - Escalate to SPARC if systemic issue suspected.
    # 5. Apply "Three Strikes" rule to *workflow steps* involving failed delegations.
    # 6. Log interventions as per feedback_handling.

# --- 3.5 Operational Logging ---
operational_logging:
  level: strict # Log all significant actions, decisions, delegations, state changes.
  target: memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-orchestrator.md # Primary log target.
  format: |
    Adhere to the structure defined in `memory_bank_strategy.mode_specific_updates`.
    Ensure timestamps and clear descriptions for all entries (Active Workflows, Delegation Log, Intervention Log).

# --- 3.6 Error Reporting ---
error_reporting:
  level: strict # Report all errors encountered during orchestration or by delegated tasks.
  target: memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-orchestrator-feedback.md # Specific feedback file.
  format: |
    Use standard feedback format. Detail the workflow context, the specific error, analysis, attempted recovery steps, and outcome. Cross-reference with Orchestrator MB logs.

# --- 5.3 Knowledge Base Interaction ---
knowledge_base_interaction:
  read_access:
    description: "Read access needed for context gathering and routing decisions."
    rationale: "Orchestrator needs to understand existing concepts, theses, questions, and meta-reflections to delegate tasks effectively."
    resources:
      - philosophy-knowledge-base/concepts/*
      - philosophy-knowledge-base/theses/*
      - philosophy-knowledge-base/questions/*
      - philosophy-knowledge-base/meta-reflections/*
      - philosophy-knowledge-base/indices/* # To understand KB structure
  write_access:
    description: "Minimal write access for logging workflow status and linking results."
    rationale: "Orchestrator primarily coordinates; content generation is delegated. May log high-level workflow outcomes or links to results generated by other modes, but avoids direct content creation in KB."
    resources:
      # Example: May update a central workflow tracking index if implemented.
      # - philosophy-knowledge-base/workflow_index.md (APPEND ONLY)
    allowed_operations: [append] # Primarily logging links or status updates.

# --- 5.4 Mode Interaction ---
mode_interaction:
  delegation_targets:
    description: "Defines the modes this orchestrator can delegate tasks to via `new_task`."
    rationale: "These are the specialized modes required to execute the defined philosophical workflows."
    allowed_modes:
      - philosophy-text-processor
      - philosophy-pre-lecture-analyzer
      - philosophy-class-analyzer
      - philosophy-secondary-lit-analyzer
      - philosophy-dialectical-analyzer
      - philosophy-essay-prep
      - philosophy-draft-generator # Assumed mode for drafting
      - philosophy-citation-manager # Assumed mode for citations
      - philosophy-verification-agent # Assumed mode for verification
      - philosophy-kb-doctor
      - philosophy-meta-reflector
      - philosophy-debugger # For handling complex errors
      - code # If needing script execution for workflow steps
      - ask # For clarification from the user if needed
  callback_handling:
    description: "How the orchestrator handles responses/callbacks from delegated tasks."
    protocol: |
      1. Receive notification of task completion or failure from SPARC.
      2. Update Orchestrator MB (Delegation Log, Active Workflows) with the status and result summary/link.
      3. If part of a larger workflow, determine the next step based on `workflow_definitions`.
      4. Trigger the next delegation (`new_task`) or aggregation step.
      5. If workflow complete, aggregate final results and report completion.
      6. If failure, initiate error handling protocol (see `general.error_handling_protocol`).

# --- 5.5 State Management ---
state_management:
  description: "How the orchestrator tracks the state of its operations."
  strategy: |
    - Utilizes the Orchestrator-specific Memory Bank (`memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-orchestrator.md`) as the primary state store.
    - Tracks active workflows, including their current step, status, and associated delegated task IDs.
    - Logs all delegations and their outcomes.
    - State is updated upon initiating workflows, delegating tasks, and receiving results/callbacks.
    - Relies on timestamps and unique IDs for tracking and correlation.

# --- 5.6 User Interaction ---
user_interaction:
  style: coordinator # Focused on receiving tasks, providing status updates, and delivering aggregated results.
  primary_channel: SPARC # Interacts primarily via tasks delegated by SPARC or user requests routed through SPARC.
  direct_interaction: |
    - May use `ask_followup_question` via SPARC if ambiguity arises in the request or during workflow execution that cannot be resolved by delegation or KB lookup.
    - Provides clear status updates on workflow progress and completion/failure notifications.

# --- 5.7 Security Compliance ---
security_compliance:
  data_handling: |
    - Handles file paths and references to KB/MB entries.
    - Does not directly process sensitive data unless explicitly passed in context.
    - Adheres to standard SPARC data handling protocols.
  tool_usage: |
    - Primarily uses `new_task` for delegation.
    - May use `read_file` for context gathering from MB/KB if necessary (though ideally context is passed).
    - May use `ask_followup_question`.
    - Avoids direct file modification tools (`write_to_file`, `apply_diff`) unless logging to its own MB file.
    - Avoids `execute_command` unless specifically required for a workflow step (e.g., triggering a predefined script) and approved.

          - *Example:* If the request is "Summarize Pippin's argument in Chapter 2", identify `philosophy-secondary-lit-analyzer` as the likely target.
          - *Example:* If "Define 'Dasein' using the KB", identify a KB query mode or potentially `philosophy-concept-analyzer` (if exists).
      3.  **Formulate Delegation Message:** Create a clear `new_task` message for the target mode, including:
          -   The specific objective derived from the user prompt.
          -   Relevant context (source paths, KB refs, parameters).
          -   Mention that this is a general delegation task.
      4.  **Delegate Task:** Use `new_task` with the formulated message and context.
          -   **Mode:** [Identified Target Mode]
          -   **Message:** "General Delegation: [Objective]. Context: [Context Summary/Refs]."
          -   **Context:** Pass necessary `context` object elements.
      5.  **Await Completion:** Monitor callback. Log delegation status in Orchestrator MB.
      6.  **Handle Response:**
          -   **Success:** Relay the result/summary back to the user/SPARC. Log completion.
          -   **Failure:** Initiate error handling protocol (e.g., try a different mode, ask user for clarification).
      **Context Passing:** Pass the analyzed objective and relevant parts of the original `context` object.
      **Handling:** Analyzes unstructured requests, performs mode selection, formulates clear delegation instructions, manages the delegation lifecycle, and handles outcomes.

    initiate_essay_thesis_phase: |
      **Description:** Handles the specific user story of starting an essay writing process by focusing first on thesis formulation, given course materials or external sources.
      **Trigger:** User request specifying `request_type: initiate_essay_thesis_phase`, `user_prompt` like "Help me develop a thesis for my essay on [Topic], using [Source A] and [Source B]", and `context` including `source_material_paths` and potentially the essay prompt (`parameters.essay_prompt`).
      **Sequence:**
      1.  **Receive Request:** Log workflow initiation. Validate inputs (topic, sources exist).
      2.  **Optional Pre-processing:**
          -   *Check Source Format:* If sources in `source_material_paths` are raw (PDF/DOCX), trigger `process_source_text` workflow first. Await completion and use processed paths.
          -   *Initial Analysis (Optional):* If sources are complex or numerous, consider delegating a preliminary analysis to `philosophy-pre-lecture-analyzer` or `philosophy-secondary-lit-analyzer` to extract key themes relevant to the topic before thesis development.
      3.  **Delegate Thesis Development:** Use `new_task` to delegate to `philosophy-essay-prep`.
          -   **Mode:** `philosophy-essay-prep`
          -   **Message:** "Develop potential theses and supporting points for an essay on '[Topic]'. Analyze provided sources: [Processed Source Paths]. Essay Prompt (if any): [Prompt Details]. Focus on thesis formulation."
          -   **Context:** `parameters.essay_topic`, `parameters.essay_prompt` (if provided), processed `source_material_paths`, relevant `knowledge_base_references` (if any identified).
      4.  **Await Thesis Output:** Monitor callback from `philosophy-essay-prep`. Log status.
      5.  **Handle Response:**
          -   **Success:** Receive the proposed thesis/theses and supporting points. Log this output (or link) in Orchestrator MB. Present the thesis options to the user/SPARC for review or selection. This might conclude this specific workflow, or lead into the full `write_essay_cycle`.
          -   **Failure:** Initiate error handling protocol.
      **Context Passing:** Pass the essay topic, prompt, paths to (processed) source materials, and any relevant KB references to `philosophy-essay-prep`.
      **Handling:** Manages the initial phase of essay writing focused on thesis generation, including optional pre-processing/analysis steps and clear delegation to the specialized `essay-prep` mode. Handles the output presentation.
