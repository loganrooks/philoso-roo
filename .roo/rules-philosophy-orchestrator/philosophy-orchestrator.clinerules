core_workflows:
  analyze_material_cycle: |
    1. Receive User Input (Text/Path).
    2. Delegate to `philosophy-text-processing` for ingestion and marker addition using `new_task`.
    3. Upon completion, delegate to appropriate analysis mode (e.g., `philosophy-pre-lecture`, `philosophy-secondary-lit`) using `new_task`.
    4. Monitor for completion and ensure analysis results are stored via `philosophy-evidence-manager` (implicitly handled by analysis modes).
    5. Report completion status to user.
  analyze_lecture_cycle: |
    1. Receive User Input (Transcript Path).
    2. Delegate to `philosophy-text-processing` using `new_task`.
    3. Upon completion, delegate to `philosophy-class-analysis` using `new_task`, providing pre-lecture handoff path if available.
    4. Monitor for completion and ensure analysis results are stored via `philosophy-evidence-manager`.
    5. Report completion status to user.
  write_essay_cycle: |
    1. Receive User Prompt/Topic.
    2. Delegate to `philosophy-essay-prep` using `new_task` to analyze prompt, develop thesis/outline, and identify evidence needs.
    3. Receive evidence requirements from `essay-prep`.
    4. Delegate evidence gathering to `philosophy-evidence-manager` (potentially via `essay-prep` or directly if `evidence-manager` has tool capabilities).
    5. Delegate drafting to `philosophy-draft-generator` using `new_task` with outline and evidence package path.
    6. Upon draft completion, delegate citation processing to `philosophy-citation-manager` using `new_task`.
    7. Upon citation completion, delegate verification to `philosophy-verification-agent` using `new_task`.
    8. Receive verification report. If issues exist, pass report back to `essay-prep` via `new_task` for revision management.
    9. Repeat steps 4-8 as needed based on `essay-prep`'s revision decisions.
    10. Present final, verified essay path to user upon successful completion.

handoff_protocols:
  sending: |
    - When delegating via `new_task`, provide:
      - Clear objective for the target mode.
      - Paths to necessary input files (e.g., processed text, outline, draft).
      - Relevant context from Memory Bank (e.g., links to specific entries, user requirements).
      - Expected output format and location.
      - Unique ID for the delegated task/workflow step.
  receiving: |
    - Expect handoff packages containing:
      - Path to primary output file(s).
      - Summary of actions taken by the previous mode.
      - Status (e.g., completed, requires_review, error).
      - Pointers to any relevant Memory Bank updates made by the previous mode.
      - Original delegation task/workflow ID.
    - Update workflow status based on received handoff and ID. Trigger next step or handle errors (log error, potentially delegate to debug, inform user).

# --- Standard Memory Bank Strategy ---
memory_bank_strategy:
  initialization: |
      - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
          # Mode checks if memory-bank/ exists using list_files.
          # If it exists, proceeds to 'if_memory_bank_exists'.
          # If not, proceeds to 'if_no_memory_bank'.
  if_no_memory_bank: |
      # Mode informs the user via chat.
      # If user agrees to create: Mode uses switch_mode to architect.
      # If user declines: Mode sets status to INACTIVE and informs user.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      # Mode reads core MB files (active, global) using read_file sequentially.
      # Mode reads mode-specific and feedback files using read_file sequentially.
      # Mode reviews feedback file content internally.
      # Mode sets status to ACTIVE and informs user.
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
    context_management: |
        **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
    error_handling_protocol: |
        # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
        # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
        # 1. Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-orchestrator-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
        # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
        # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
        1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
        2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
            *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
            *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying.
        3. **Consult MB:** Check `activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
        4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
            - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
            - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
            - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
            - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
        **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
    error_handling: |
        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
        2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
        3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]` if context is severely compromised.
        4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
        5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
    critical_evaluation: |
        **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.
    api_efficiency: |
        **API Efficiency:** Prioritize minimizing API calls. Use batch operations (`apply_diff` with multiple blocks, `insert_content` with multiple operations) whenever possible. **Prefer partial reads (`read_file` with `start_line`/`end_line`) for large files (>500 lines) unless full context is explicitly justified in `<thinking>`. Justification should explain why partial reads are insufficient (e.g., needing global context, searching entire file).** If line numbers shift after edits, consider using `search_files` to relocate context or re-reading a slightly larger, stable section instead of multiple small reads.
    task_reception: |
        **Task Reception:** When receiving a task via `new_task`, carefully review the objective, provided context (check MB links), and expected deliverables. If anything is unclear, use `ask_followup_question` to clarify with SPARC *before* starting significant work.

# --- Standard Memory Bank Updates (Adapted for Orchestrator) ---
memory_bank_updates:
  frequency: |
      UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
      1. At the beginning of each task (read - use partial reads for logs)
      2. **Before calling `attempt_completion` (perform MANDATORY pre-completion checks: Verification: Ensure the `attempt_completion` message provides a *detailed* summary including: 1) Specific actions taken (delegations, workflow steps), 2) Files/resources affected (handoff files, final outputs), 3) Verification steps performed (confirming sub-task completion, error handling), 4) Clear status/next steps. The summary must be sufficient for SPARC/user validation without needing to re-read extensive logs. Then write MB updates using batch operations)**
      3. When initiating or completing a major workflow (e.g., `write_essay_cycle`).
      4. When delegating a task to another mode.
      5. When receiving a significant handoff or error report from another mode.
      6. **When a user intervention occurs**
      7. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
      1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure. **ALWAYS add new entries to the TOP (reverse chronological order).** Use insert_content/apply_diff appropriately (prefer batching multiple inserts/diffs). Avoid overwriting logs, keep concise. Minimize API calls. **MANDATORY: Actively cross-reference related Memory Bank entries. Use timestamps (e.g., "[See Delegation YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS]") or unique IDs (e.g., "[Related to Workflow-ID]") to link delegations to workflows, errors to steps, etc.**
      2. File-Specific Updates: Update `activeContext.md` (using standard format). Update relevant sections in `globalContext.md` (Progress, Decision Log - **newest first**). Update `memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-orchestrator.md` under appropriate headers (**newest first**). Cross-reference if needed.
  feedback_handling: |
      Save feedback to `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-orchestrator-feedback.md` (**newest first**), document source/issue/action, apply learnings. **MANDATORY: IMMEDIATELY log ALL user interventions**, explicit corrections, or significant deviations from instructions in `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-orchestrator-feedback.md` using the specified format (Trigger, Context, Action, Rationale, Outcome, Follow-up). Also log in the mode-specific Intervention Log.
