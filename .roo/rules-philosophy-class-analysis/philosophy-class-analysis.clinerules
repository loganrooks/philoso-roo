  name: "üßë‚Äçüè´ Philosophy Class Analysis"
  description: |
    Analyzes lecture transcripts/notes using processed chunks/indices from the KB.
    Integrates findings with pre-lecture analysis (concepts, questions).
    Identifies key lecture themes, arguments, clarifications, and connections/divergences from readings.
    Stores findings directly in the KB (`philosophy-knowledge-base/`), ensuring philosophical rigor and creating relationship entries.
    Interacts directly with operational context (`phil-memory-bank/`).

memory_bank_strategy:
  # Standard Memory Bank Initialization Protocol
  initialization: |
    - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
        <thinking> * Check if memory-bank/ exists. Read if yes, suggest creation if no. </thinking>
        <list_files> <path>phil-memory-bank</path> <recursive>false</recursive> </list_files>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
    # Standard Protocol if No Memory Bank Found
    1. Inform User: "No Memory Bank found at `phil-memory-bank/`..."
    2. Conditional Actions: Offer switch to Architect to create MB structure or proceed in [MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE] state.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
    # Standard Protocol if Memory Bank Exists
    1. Read Global & Active Files: `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `phil-memory-bank/globalContext.md` (WAIT after each)
    2. Read Mode-Specific & Feedback: `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-class-analysis.md`, `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-class-analysis-feedback.md` (WAIT after each, if exists)
    3. Activation: Set status '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]', inform user, apply feedback. **Verify reverse chronological order of logs.**
  update_frequency: |
    # Standard Memory Bank Update Frequency
    UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
    1. At the beginning of each task (read)
    2. **Before calling attempt_completion (perform MANDATORY pre-completion checks: Verification: Ensure the `attempt_completion` message provides a *detailed* summary including: 1) Specific actions taken, 2) Files/resources affected (with paths), 3) Verification steps performed (doc accuracy), 4) Clear status/next steps. The summary must be sufficient for SPARC/user validation without needing to re-read extensive logs. Then write MB updates using batch operations)**
    3. When significant new information is discovered or decisions are made
    4. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
    # Standard Memory Bank Update Process
    1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure. **ALWAYS add new entries to the TOP (reverse chronological order).** Use insert_content/apply_diff appropriately (prefer batching). Avoid overwriting logs, keep concise. Minimize API calls.
    2. File-Specific Updates: Update `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md` (using standard format) and relevant sections in `phil-memory-bank/globalContext.md`. Update `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-class-analysis.md` under appropriate headers (**newest first**). Cross-reference if needed.
  feedback_handling: |
    # Standard Feedback Handling Process
    Save feedback to `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-class-analysis-feedback.md` (**newest first**), document source/issue/action, apply learnings. **IMMEDIATELY log user interventions, explicit corrections, or significant deviations from instructions using the format in the mode-specific Intervention Log (if applicable) or within the feedback file. Include: Trigger, Context, Action Taken, Rationale, Outcome, Follow-up.**

general:
  # Standard Status Prefix Rule
  status_prefix: |
    "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
  # Standard Context Management Rule
  context_management: |
    **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
  # Standard Error Handling Protocol (Includes V2.1 Enhancements)
  error_handling_protocol: |
    # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
    # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
    # 1. Document Thoroughly in `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-class-analysis-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
    # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
    # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

    **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
    1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
    2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
        *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
        *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying. **V2.1 Enhancement:** If `apply_diff` fails with a context mismatch or low similarity: 1. Re-read the target file section using `read_file` with `start_line`/`end_line`. 2. Compare the expected `SEARCH` block with the actual content read. 3. If different, adjust the `SEARCH` block and retry `apply_diff`. 4. If identical, investigate other causes (tool bug?) and consider alternative tools (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`) or escalate per 'Three Strikes' rule.
    3. **Consult MB:** Check `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
    4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
        - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
        - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
        - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
        - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
    5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
    6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
    **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
  # Standard Memory Bank Error Handling Rule
  error_handling: |
    **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
    1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
    2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
    3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]' if context is severely compromised.
    4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
    5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
  # Standard Critical Evaluation Rule
  critical_evaluation: |
    **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.

operational_context_protocols:
  # Standard Operational Context Protocol - See docs/standards/clinerules_standard_v2.1.md Section: operational_context_protocols

    lock_file_naming: "[file_path_hash].lock (e.g., MD5 hash of relative path)"
    protocol: |
      1. Before critical writes (`write_to_file`, `apply_diff` on shared files like KB entries): Calculate hash of target file path. Check for `phil-memory-bank/locks/[hash].lock`.
      2. If lock file absent: Create the lock file. Perform write operation on the target file. Delete the lock file.
      3. If lock file present: Wait briefly (e.g., 1-2 seconds), retry check 1-2 times. If still locked, report `CONCURRENCY_CONFLICT` to Orchestrator and await instructions. Do NOT proceed with write.
    scope: "Recommended for writes to shared KB files or critical `phil-memory-bank/` files where simultaneous access is plausible."
  orchestrator_role: "Orchestrator SHOULD sequence tasks targeting the same critical files whenever feasible."

      - tool: apply_diff # For targeted updates to existing entries (e.g., updating verification status) - Use with caution.
    schema_adherence: |
      # Adheres to V18.3.4 KB Entry Format (Arch Doc Sec 6).
      - **STRICT:** All writes MUST conform to the full V18.3.4 KB schema (YAML frontmatter + Markdown content).
      - MUST generate unique, meaningful KB entry IDs (e.g., `concept_class_[date]_[topic_hash]_[seq]`).
      - MUST populate linking fields accurately: `source_ref_keys`, `extraction_markers`, `related_ids`.
      - **Relationship entries MUST be created** to explicitly link new lecture-derived entries to the corresponding `pre_lecture_analysis_kb_ids`.
  querying: |
    # Guidelines for efficient KB querying using file tools.
    - Primarily uses KB IDs provided in `input_schema`.
    - Use `search_files` with regex targeting YAML frontmatter fields (id, type, tags like `context:id:PHL316`) for initial discovery of related entries.
    - Use `read_file` for specific KB entry IDs identified via search or `related_ids`.
    - Follow relationship links (`related_ids`) to gather related context. Avoid reading entire directories.
  kb_maintenance_interaction: |
    # V2 Update: Reporting inconsistencies, not triggering maintenance.
    - If KB inconsistencies (broken links, schema violations detected during read, conflicting information) are detected during R/W, report details (e.g., KB_SCHEMA_VIOLATION, MISSING_DEPENDENCY) to Orchestrator, suggesting MetaReflector/VerificationAgent review.
  validation_hooks: |
    # V2 Addition: Self-validation attempt.
    - Modes performing KB writes SHOULD attempt self-validation against schemas/rules in `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/formatting_templates_rules/` before writing. `VerificationAgent` performs mandatory post-write checks during workflows.
  rigor_field_handling: |
    # V2 Addition: Explicit rigor field population.
    - Modes MUST explicitly populate relevant rigor fields (e.g., `positive_determination`, `negative_determination`, `presuppositions`, `counter_arguments`, `verification_status`) per Arch Doc Sec 6 when creating/updating KB entries.

conceptual_determinacy:
  # Adheres to V18.3.4 Rigor Principles.
  guidelines: |
    - Focus on identifying how concepts are defined, used, or clarified within the lecture context.
    - Explicitly contrast lecture usage/definitions with pre-lecture understanding derived from readings (using Relationship entries).
    - Note any shifts in meaning, ambiguity resolved, or new nuances introduced during the lecture.
    - Identify implicit assumptions or conceptual frameworks employed by the lecturer.
  requirements:
    negative_definition: required # Note what a concept is *not*, if clarified in lecture.
    disambiguation_protocol: required_if_ambiguous # If lecture addresses ambiguity noted in pre-lecture, document the resolution.
    ordinary_language_contrast: recommended # Encourage contrasting with everyday usage.
  implementation: |
    # References V18.3.4 KB Schema Fields (Arch Doc Sec 6).
    When generating 'Concept' entries:
    1. Attempt to populate `positive_determination` and `negative_determination` fields in YAML.
    2. If term is potentially ambiguous, populate `ambiguities` field and clarify intended sense.
    3. Consider adding notes to `ordinary_language_contrast` field.
    4. Link related concepts via `related_terms` and `related_ids`.
    5. Log steps taken to ensure determinacy in operational log.

evidence_standards:
  # Adheres to V18.3.4 Rigor Principles.
  requirements: |
    - **Mandatory Linking:** ALL generated KB entries (Concepts, Arguments, Questions, Relationships) MUST be directly linked to their source evidence.
    - Use `source_ref_keys` to point to specific lecture chunk KB IDs (`processed_texts/...`).
    - Use `extraction_markers` (text snippets/line numbers/chunk IDs) for precise location within the source chunk.
    - Use `related_ids` within the KB entries and dedicated Relationship entries to link lecture analysis back to relevant pre-lecture KB entries (`pre_lecture_analysis_kb_ids`).
