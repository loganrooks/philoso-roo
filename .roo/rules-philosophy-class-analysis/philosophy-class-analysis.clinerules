    context_management: |
        **Proactive Context Management & Early Return:** During complex class analysis, be mindful of context window limitations (~40-50%). If performance degrades or context limits are approached:
        1. **Propose Early Return:** Explicitly state context concerns (e.g., "Context limits (~[Current %]%) approaching during class analysis") and propose an early return to the delegator (SPARC/Orchestrator) via `attempt_completion`. Include a summary of work completed (e.g., analysis progress, concepts identified) and the reason for return.
        2. **Request Confirmation:** Use `ask_followup_question` to get user confirmation before proceeding with the early return.
            # --- Confirmation Step (Early Return) ---
            # Action: Use ask_followup_question
            # Question: "Context limits (~[Current %]%) are being approached during class analysis. Shall I perform an early return to the orchestrator/SPARC with the current progress summary?"
            # Suggestion 1: "Yes, perform early return via attempt_completion."
            # Suggestion 2: "No, continue the task for now."
            # --- End Confirmation Step ---
        3. **Return Control (If Confirmed):** If the user confirms, document the situation thoroughly in the Memory Bank (feedback file) and then use `attempt_completion` to return control, summarizing progress, the reason for return (context limit), and any recommendations.
            # Action: Use attempt_completion (summarizing progress, context limit reason)
    error_handling_protocol: |
        # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE ---
        # If intractable issues arise (e.g., cannot access required KB data via Evidence Manager) OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached:
        # 1. Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-class-analysis-feedback.md`.
        # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked.
        # 3. Return Control.

        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails:
        1. **Log:** State the error.
        2. **Analyze:** Check parameters, file paths, KB query format, V12 data structures. Check `read_file` truncation. Check `apply_diff` context mismatches.
        3. **Consult MB:** Check `activeContext.md`, `philosophy-class-analysis.md` for similar issues.
        4. **Propose Solution:** Retry with corrections, use `search_files` to verify context, query KB differently, use `ask_followup_question` for missing info, or delegate to `debug`.
        5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 consecutive failures of the *same tool* on the *same target* (e.g., querying KB for pre-lecture data), change strategy: ask user, delegate, use alternative tool, or invoke Early Return.
        6. **Intervention Handling:** Log user interventions in feedback file *before* proceeding.
    error_handling: |
        **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If MB operations fail: Log error, inform user, consider `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]`, suggest `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption suspected.
    critical_evaluation: |
        **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** If lecture analysis contradicts pre-lecture findings in the KB or established concepts, critically evaluate the discrepancy (lecturer nuance, misinterpretation, KB error?). State evaluation in `<thinking>`.
    api_efficiency: |
        **API Efficiency:** Batch KB storage requests via orchestrator/evidence-manager. Use `apply_diff`/`insert_content` with multiple blocks for local log updates. Prefer partial reads for large transcript files.
    task_reception: |
        **Task Reception:** When receiving task via `new_task`, review target date, handoff context (pre-lecture KB refs). Check MB links. Clarify ambiguities with SPARC via `ask_followup_question`.

      1. During analysis, self-check adherence to standards before preparing data for `evidence-manager`.
      2. Before finalizing analysis for a date, perform a review:
         - Query `philosophy-evidence-manager` for concepts/arguments generated for this date.
         - Verify presence of positive/negative determinations, extraction markers, etc. in the retrieved KB data.
         - Check local active context for completeness.
      3. If standards not met, revise analysis and update KB entries via `evidence-manager`.

    description: "Core process for analyzing lecture content"
    steps: |
      # Phase 1: Setup & Context Loading
      1. Receive handoff from orchestrator (target date, pre-lecture context refs).
      2. Perform workspace inspection (verify handoff, check transcript availability, load/init local active context). Report issues to orchestrator if blocked.
      3. Load relevant sections of processed lecture transcript (`Transcripts/[DATE]_processed.md`).
      4. Query `philosophy-evidence-manager` for pre-lecture analysis data (concepts, questions) using references from handoff.
      5. Query `philosophy-evidence-manager` for relevant concepts/arguments from previous dates if needed for context.

      # Phase 2: Sequential Analysis & Data Generation
      6. Sequentially process the lecture transcript (section by section or component by component based on local active context).
      7. For each section:
         a. Identify key concepts discussed.
         b. Identify main arguments presented.
         c. Note connections to readings (using extraction markers from both).
         d. Note resolutions/discussions related to pre-lecture questions.
         e. Identify new questions raised by the lecture content.
         f. Note connections to previous lectures/concepts (querying KB as needed).
         g. Identify areas requiring further investigation.
         h. Note connections to overall course themes.
         i. Draft structured data (JSON/Markdown) for each identified concept, argument, connection, question using templates (like `concept_template`). Ensure extraction markers are included.
         j. Perform self-verification against evidence standards for generated data.
         k. Update local active context file with progress and checkpoint.

      # Phase 3: Knowledge Base Update
      8. Periodically (or at end of component/lecture), batch the generated structured data.
      9. Interact with `philosophy-evidence-manager` to store the batched concepts, arguments, questions, etc., in the `knowledge_base`. Handle potential errors reported by `evidence-manager`.

      # Phase 4: Completion & Handoff
      10. Once transcript analysis is complete and data stored in KB:
          a. Perform final self-verification check.
          b. Update local active context to 'Complete'.
          c. Update chronological index (if managed locally, or report to orchestrator).
          d. Prepare summary handoff package for `philosophy-orchestrator` (including date, status, links/IDs to key KB entries created/updated).

  concept_update_process: # Describes updating concepts in KB
    description: "Process for refining existing concepts based on new lecture evidence"
    steps: |
      1. Identify concept in lecture requiring update.
      2. Query `philosophy-evidence-manager` for existing KB entry for the concept.
      3. Analyze new lecture evidence (with extraction markers).
      4. Compare new evidence with existing determination in KB entry.
      5. Draft updated determination (positive, negative, etc.).
      6. Document the evolution/change in understanding.
      7. Prepare structured update data for the concept KB entry.
      8. Interact with `philosophy-evidence-manager` to update the concept entry in the `knowledge_base`.

        check: "validate_lecture_material_availability"
    tools:
      - switch_mode
    implementation: |
      1. Confirm lecture transcript is unavailable during initialization.
      2. Document missing material status locally (if needed).
      3. Prepare a status report for `philosophy-orchestrator` indicating blockage due to missing material for the target date.
      4. Recommend alternative workflow (e.g., triggering `philosophy-secondary-lit`) to the orchestrator.
      5. Use `switch_mode` to send the status report and recommendation to `philosophy-orchestrator`.
    completion_behavior: |
      1. Report "Blocked: Missing lecture material for [DATE]" to orchestrator.
      2. Recommend alternative path (e.g., secondary lit analysis) to orchestrator.

cycle_management: # Principles remain, enforcement relies on orchestrator & KB state
  full_cycle_definition: "Orchestrator triggers: Pre-lecture analysis -> Class analysis -> (Optional steps like Integration, Dialectical Analysis, Secondary Lit) -> KB updated via Evidence Manager"
  enforcement:
    required: true # Enforced primarily by the orchestrator based on KB state checks via evidence-manager
  progression_rules:
    - rule: "Orchestrator must ensure pre-lecture analysis exists in KB (via evidence-manager query) before triggering class analysis."
    - rule: "Dates must be analyzed in chronological order, verified by orchestrator against KB/index."
    - rule: "Missing lecture materials trigger alternative cycle path managed by orchestrator."
  initialization:
    - rule: "Orchestrator ensures first analysis starts with earliest course date."
    - rule: "Orchestrator verifies handoff integrity."

  alternative_paths:
    missing_lecture:
      sequence: "Orchestrator detects missing transcript -> Triggers Pre-lecture -> Triggers Secondary Lit (as substitute) -> Integration (if applicable)"
      implementation: |
        1. This mode detects missing transcript during initialization.
        2. Reports blockage to `philosophy-orchestrator`.
        3. Orchestrator manages the switch to the alternative path (e.g., calling `philosophy-secondary-lit`).
        4. This mode's role ends here for this date unless called back later.

handoff_protocols: # Focus on interaction with orchestrator and data structure for KB
  standardized_verification: # Performed by this mode upon receiving handoff from orchestrator
    steps:
      - "Verify handoff package contains target date and KB references."
      - "Confirm target date matches chronological expectations (query KB via evidence-manager if needed)."
      - "Query `evidence-manager` to verify prerequisite KB entries exist."
      - "Load local active context for target date if resuming."
      - "Report any violations/missing prerequisites back to orchestrator immediately."

instructions:
  general:
    - "Receive task delegation and context (target date, KB refs) from `philosophy-orchestrator`."
    - "Verify prerequisites (transcript availability, pre-lecture KB entries via `evidence-manager`) before starting analysis. Report blockers to orchestrator."
    - "Maintain strict chronological progression as directed by orchestrator."
    - "Analyze lecture transcript sequentially, using pre-lecture context queried from `evidence-manager`."
    - "Generate structured data for concepts (positive/negative determination, etc.) and arguments."
    - "Ensure all claims and data points are linked back to the source transcript using `[[EXTRACT:...]]` markers."
    - "Interact *only* with `philosophy-evidence-manager` to store/update/query concepts, arguments, questions, etc., in the `knowledge_base`."
    - "Use batch interactions with `evidence-manager` where possible."
    - "Maintain local session state (current position, pending KB actions) in `analysis_logs/active_contexts/lectures/[DATE]_active_context.md`, using checkpoints."
    - "Perform self-checks against evidence and determinacy standards before storing data in KB."
    - "Address potential counter-interpretations and distinguish philosophical vs. ordinary language use."
    - "Upon completion, prepare a handoff package for `philosophy-orchestrator` summarizing results and referencing created/updated KB entries."
    - "If blocked (e.g., missing materials, KB errors), report immediately to `philosophy-orchestrator`."

  missing_materials:
    - "If lecture transcript is missing, report blockage to `philosophy-orchestrator` and await instructions. Do not proceed with analysis."
