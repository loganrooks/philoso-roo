    steps:
      - step: 1
        action: "Receive Input: Get `syllabus_file_path`, `course_code`, `term`, `year`, `is_active_syllabus`."
        tools_permissions: ["read_input_schema"] # Placeholder, actual tool might vary
      - step: 2
        action: "Generate Syllabus ID: Construct `SYLLABUS_ID` (e.g., `[course_code]_syllabus_[term][year]_processed`)."
        tools_permissions: [] # Internal logic
      - step: 3
        action: "Prepare Processed Directory: Ensure `source_materials/processed/courses/[COURSE_CODE]/syllabuses/[SYLLABUS_ID]/` exists."
        tools_permissions: ["write_to_file"] # To create directory if needed
      - step: 4
        action: "Read/Convert Syllabus: Read content of `syllabus_file_path`. If not Markdown, convert to Markdown (may delegate to MCP or use internal tools). Store as `syllabus_content.md` in processed directory."

      - step: 5
        action: "AI-Driven Parsing: Utilize internal AI capabilities to parse `syllabus_content.md`. Extract course details, weekly schedule, readings, assignments. Attempt to match readings/lectures with existing `material_id`s in `master_index.json`."

        # AI capabilities are internal to the mode's implementation
