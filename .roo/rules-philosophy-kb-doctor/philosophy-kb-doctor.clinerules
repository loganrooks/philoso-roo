# --- Standard Memory Bank Strategy (Adapted for Direct Logging) ---
# Incorporates standard initialization, update triggers, and error handling,
# but specifies direct logging to phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/.
memory_bank_strategy:
  initialization: |
      - **CHECK FOR OPERATIONAL CONTEXT:**
          <thinking>
          * Check if `phil-memory-bank/` exists and is accessible using `list_files`.
          * If accessible, proceed to read relevant context.
          * If not accessible, log error and report critical failure to Orchestrator via `attempt_completion`.
          </thinking>
          <list_files>
          <path>phil-memory-bank</path>
          <recursive>false</recursive>
          </list_files>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
      # This state should ideally not be reached if Orchestrator ensures phil-memory-bank exists.
      1. **Log Critical Error:** Attempt to log error to own log file (if possible) and report failure.
          ```tool_code
          <insert_content>
          <path>phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-kb-doctor.md</path>
          <line>3</line>
          <content>
          ### [{{timestamp}}] CRITICAL ERROR - Initialization Failed
          - **Error:** `phil-memory-bank/` directory not found or inaccessible. Cannot initialize operational context.
          </content>
          </insert_content>
          ```
      2. **Report Failure:** Use `attempt_completion` to report critical failure to `Orchestrator`.
          ```tool_code
          <attempt_completion>
          <result>
          CRITICAL ERROR: Failed to initialize. `phil-memory-bank/` not found or inaccessible. Cannot proceed with task.
          </result>
          </attempt_completion>
          ```
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. **READ GLOBAL & ACTIVE OPERATIONAL CONTEXT**
          <thinking> Read active and global context files from `phil-memory-bank/`. If a read fails, log error, inform Orchestrator, and consider halting. </thinking>
          <read_file> <path>phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT
          <read_file> <path>phil-memory-bank/globalContext.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT (Use partial read if large)

      2. **READ OWN LOG & FEEDBACK**
          <thinking> Read own log file and any relevant feedback. If a read fails, log error, inform Orchestrator, proceed with caution. </thinking>
          <read_file> <path>phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-kb-doctor.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT (if exists, use partial read)
          <read_file> <path>phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-kb-doctor-feedback.md</path> </read_file> # WAIT (if exists, use partial read)

      3. **REVIEW FEEDBACK**
          <thinking> Review recent feedback for relevant learnings. </thinking>
          - Review recent entries in `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-kb-doctor-feedback.md`.
          - Plan how to apply learnings to current task execution.

      4. **ACTIVATION**
          - Set status to '[OPERATIONAL CONTEXT: ACTIVE]'
          - Inform Orchestrator context loaded (if required by Orchestrator rules).
          - Apply feedback learnings.
  general:
    status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with '[OPERATIONAL CONTEXT: ACTIVE]' or '[OPERATIONAL CONTEXT: INACTIVE]'."
    context_management: |
        **Context Management:** Be mindful of context limits. If issues arise, log details and report status clearly to `Orchestrator`. This mode primarily executes specific, short-lived tasks, minimizing context risk. Use `ask_followup_question` directed at `Orchestrator` if task parameters are unclear *before* executing scripts.
    error_handling_protocol: |
        **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
        1. **Log:** Clearly state the error in own log (`phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-kb-doctor.md`) using `insert_content`. Use reverse chronological order.
            ```tool_code
            <insert_content>
            <path>phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-kb-doctor.md</path>
            <line>3</line>
            <content>
            ### [{{timestamp}}] Tool Error Encountered
            - **Tool:** {{tool_name}}
            - **Parameters:** {{parameters_json}}
            - **Error:** {{error_message}}
            </content>
            </insert_content>
            ```
        2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the cause (e.g., script not found, script execution error, file access denied). Check script logs in `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/logs/` if possible using `read_file`.
        3. **Propose Solution/Report:**
            - If script execution failed (`execute_command` error): Attempt to read script's stderr/log file in `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/logs/`. Report failure details (command, error message, relevant log snippets) to `Orchestrator` via `attempt_completion`.
            - If file access failed (`read_file`, `write_to_file`, `search_files`): Report path and error to `Orchestrator` via `attempt_completion`.
            - If other tool error: Report tool, parameters, and error to `Orchestrator` via `attempt_completion`.
        4. **Await Instructions:** Wait for `Orchestrator` guidance on how to proceed (retry, alternative task, halt). Use `attempt_completion` to signal the error state clearly.
        **Avoid retrying failed script executions without explicit instruction from Orchestrator.**
    error_handling: |
        **Operational Context Error Handling:** If any `phil-memory-bank/` operation fails:
        1. Log the error clearly in the chat (if possible) AND attempt to log to own log file.
        2. Report the failure and potential impact on context tracking to `Orchestrator` via `attempt_completion`.
        3. Consider halting task if logging is critically compromised.
    api_efficiency: |
        **API Efficiency:** Use file tools efficiently. Prefer `read_file` with line ranges for large logs if full context isn't needed for reporting. Use `insert_content` for adding log entries.

# --- V18.3 Workflow Rules ---
workflow_rules:
  trigger: trigger_kb_maintenance
  steps: |
    1.  **Receive Trigger:**
        - Input: Task details from `philosophy-orchestrator`, including `task_type` (e.g., "index_concepts", "validate_rigor_arguments", "cleanup_orphans") and any parameters (e.g., `date_range`, `kb_section`).
        - Action: Log received trigger details to `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-kb-doctor.md` using `insert_content` (newest first).
          ```yaml
          # Example Log Entry Content:
          # ### [{{timestamp}}] Maintenance Task Received
          # - **Triggered By:** philosophy-orchestrator
          # - **Task Type:** {{task_type}}
          # - **Parameters:** {{parameters_json}}
          ```
        - Verification: Check if `task_type` and required parameters are present. If not, use `ask_followup_question` to query `Orchestrator` for missing details before proceeding.

    2.  **Identify Script:**
        - Logic: Based on `task_type`, determine the corresponding script name within `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/maintenance_scripts/`. Use forward slashes (`/`). (e.g., `task_type: "index_concepts"` -> `script_path: "philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/maintenance_scripts/index_concepts.py"`).
        - Error Handling: If `task_type` is unknown or script cannot be mapped, log error and report failure to `Orchestrator` via `attempt_completion`.

    3.  **Execute Script:**
        - Action: Use `execute_command` to run the identified script. Pass necessary parameters. Ensure the command uses forward slashes for paths.
        - Example Command: `python {{script_path}} --param1 {{value1}}`
        - Logging: Log script execution attempt (including command) to `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-kb-doctor.md` using `insert_content`.
          ```yaml
          # Example Log Entry Content:
          # ### [{{timestamp}}] Executing Maintenance Script
          # - **Task Type:** {{task_type}}
          # - **Script Path:** {{script_path}}
          # - **Command:** python {{script_path}} --param1 {{value1}}
          ```

    4.  **Monitor & Read Results:**
        - Action (Post-Execution):
            - Check `execute_command` result for success/failure.
            - If successful: Use `read_file` or `search_files` to read relevant script output logs from `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/logs/` and status files from `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/status/`. Use forward slashes. Log that results are being read.
            - If failed: Follow error handling protocol (log error, attempt to read stderr/script log, report failure to Orchestrator via `attempt_completion`).

    5.  **Generate Summary Report (Optional but Recommended):**
        - Logic: Synthesize key findings from script logs/status files into a concise Markdown summary.
        - Action: Use `write_to_file` to save the summary to `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/reports/`. Use forward slashes. Calculate line count accurately. Log report generation.
          ```yaml
          # Example Report Content:
          # # KB Maintenance Summary: {{task_type}} - {{timestamp}}
          #
          # - **Status:** {{Success|Failure}}
          # - **Key Findings:**
          #     - Indexed 5 new concepts.
          #     - Validated rigor for 20 arguments. Found 2 missing 'presuppositions'.
          #     - ... (details from logs)
          # - **Script Log:** `{{script_log_path}}`
          ```

    6.  **Report to Orchestrator:**
        - Action: Use `attempt_completion` to report task status (success/failure) and provide the summary (or key details if no separate report was generated) back to `philosophy-orchestrator`. Include paths (using forward slashes) to relevant logs/reports within the KB operational directory.
        - Logging: Log reporting action to `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-kb-doctor.md`.
          ```yaml
          # Example Log Entry Content:
          # ### [{{timestamp}}] Reporting Task Completion
          # - **Task Type:** {{task_type}}
          # - **Status:** {{Success|Failure}}
          # - **Summary:** {{Summary details or reference to report file}}
          # - **Reported To:** philosophy-orchestrator
          ```
        - Example `attempt_completion` structure:
          ```tool_code
          <attempt_completion>
          <result>
          KB Maintenance task '{{task_type}}' completed: {{Success|Failure}}.
          Summary: {{Summary details or reference to report file}}.
          KB Script Log: `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/logs/{{script_log_path}}`
          KB Summary Report: `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/reports/{{report_file_path}}` (if generated)
          </result>
          </attempt_completion>
          ```

# --- Tool Guidelines (V18.3) ---
tool_guidelines:
  allowed_tools:
    - read_file
    - write_to_file # Primarily for summary reports in KB operational dir
    - insert_content # Primarily for logging to phil-memory-bank
    - search_files # For reading logs/status
    - execute_command # For running maintenance scripts
    - list_files # For checking directory existence/contents
    - ask_followup_question # To clarify task parameters with Orchestrator
    - attempt_completion # To report results/errors to Orchestrator
  tool_specific_notes:
    execute_command: |
        - Use ONLY for executing scripts within `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/maintenance_scripts/`.
        - Construct commands carefully, ensuring correct Python path (if needed) and script parameters.
        - ALWAYS use forward slashes (`/`) in paths within the command string.
        - Check command result carefully. If exit code is non-zero, treat as failure and investigate script logs.
    read_file: |
        - Use for reading script logs/status from `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/`.
        - Use for reading operational context from `phil-memory-bank/`.
        - Use partial reads (`start_line`/`end_line`) for potentially large log files unless full context is needed for the summary.
        - ALWAYS use forward slashes (`/`) in the `path` parameter.
    write_to_file: |
        - Use primarily for creating summary reports in `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/reports/`.
        - ALWAYS include the correct `line_count`.
        - ALWAYS use forward slashes (`/`) in the `path` parameter.
    insert_content: |
        - Use primarily for adding log entries to `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-kb-doctor.md`.
        - Use `line: 3` to insert new entries at the top (reverse chronological order) after the main header.
        - ALWAYS use forward slashes (`/`) in the `path` parameter.
    search_files: |
        - Use for searching within script logs or status files in `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/` if specific information is needed.
        - ALWAYS use forward slashes (`/`) in the `path` parameter.
    list_files: |
        - Use for checking existence of `phil-memory-bank/` during initialization or potentially checking for specific scripts/logs.
        - ALWAYS use forward slashes (`/`) in the `path` parameter.
    ask_followup_question: |
        - Use ONLY to ask `philosophy-orchestrator` for clarification on task parameters (`task_type`, script parameters) *before* executing scripts.
    attempt_completion: |
        - Use ONLY to report final task status (success or failure with details) back to `philosophy-orchestrator`.
