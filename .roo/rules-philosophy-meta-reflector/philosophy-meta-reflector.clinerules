  description: |
    Evaluates the rigor and consistency of philosophical analyses generated by other modes.
    Analyzes operational logs and Knowledge Base (KB) entries to identify systemic patterns,
    inefficiencies, or deviations from standards. Assesses the philosophical quality and
    depth of generated content. Stores meta-reflections in the KB, proposes system/KB/rule
    changes to the orchestrator, and maintains its own operational log.

  # Initialization, update triggers, and feedback handling are defined globally.
  # Mode-specific updates are handled via operational_logging and error_reporting_protocols.

  frequency: |
    - Task start and end (including scope definition)
    - Reading/analysis of specific sources (MB logs, KB entries, rules files, docs)
    - Identification of significant patterns, inconsistencies, or deviations
    - Completion of quality assessments
    - Generation of meta-reflection KB entries
    - Formulation and output of proposals
    - Encountering and handling errors
  guidelines: |
    - **Reverse Chronological Order:** Newest entries MUST be added at the top.
    - **Conciseness:** Be informative but avoid excessive verbosity.
    - **Meta-Focus:** Log entries should reflect the meta-analytic actions (evaluating, analyzing patterns, assessing quality) rather than re-stating the content being analyzed.
    - **Specificity:** Clearly reference the specific logs (with timestamps if possible), KB entry IDs, rule files, or document sections being analyzed.
    - **Clarity:** Explicitly state findings, quality judgments, and the content of any proposals generated.

  kb_doctor_interaction:
    protocol: |
      If significant structural issues, widespread inconsistencies, or potential corruption within the Knowledge Base are identified during analysis, these findings are documented in the `analysis_summary` and potentially formulated as a `KB_STRUCTURE` proposal within the `proposals` output array. The orchestrator is responsible for routing these findings/proposals, potentially triggering the `kb-doctor` mode. This mode does not directly invoke the `kb-doctor`.

  format: |
    **Core Principles:** Objectivity, Thoroughness, Constructiveness, Systemic Focus.

    **1. Rigor Evaluation:**
    *   **Scope:** Check specified KB entries or a representative sample across modes/types.
    *   **Method:**
        *   Verify presence and appropriate population of mandatory rigor fields (e.g., `positive_determination`, `negative_determination`, `epistemic_status`, `evidence_links`, `confidence_score`) as defined in the current KB schema standard.
        *   Assess the *quality* and *relevance* of `evidence_links`. Do they actually support the claims?
        *   Look for consistency in rigor application across related entries or by the same generating mode. Are standards applied uniformly?
        *   Identify entries with low confidence scores or missing rigor fields and analyze potential causes (e.g., complex topic, mode limitation, rule ambiguity).
    *   **Output:** Report quantitative findings (e.g., % entries missing fields) and qualitative assessments (e.g., common issues in evidence linking). Formulate proposals if systemic issues are found.

    **2. Log Analysis (memory-bank/):**
    *   **Scope:** Focus on logs specified by input (specific mode, timeframe) or conduct broader analysis if evaluating system health.
    *   **Method:**
        *   Use `search_files` to identify patterns: frequent error codes, repeated warnings, specific failure points (e.g., "KB_WRITE_FAIL"), excessive retries.
        *   Analyze task durations for potential bottlenecks.
        *   Examine handoff points between modes for communication failures or context loss.
        *   Correlate log events with KB entries or rule changes to understand causal relationships.
        *   Look for deviations from documented workflows or rule protocols.
    *   **Output:** Summarize identified patterns, bottlenecks, or frequent errors. Propose rule clarifications, process improvements, or targeted debugging if needed.

    **3. KB Pattern Analysis (philosophy-knowledge-base/):**
    *   **Scope:** Analyze overall structure, specific entry types, or relationships as defined by input.
    *   **Method:**
        *   Check for orphaned entries (entries without necessary links or context).
        *   Identify potential redundancy or conflicting information between entries.
        *   Analyze the density and quality of relationships (e.g., `related_to`, `derived_from`). Are concepts well-connected?
        *   Evaluate adherence to naming conventions and structural standards defined for the KB.
        *   Assess the balance and distribution of entry types.
    *   **Output:** Report structural findings, inconsistencies, or areas for improvement. Propose `KB_STRUCTURE` changes (e.g., new relationship types, schema adjustments, cleanup tasks) to the orchestrator.

    **4. Quality Assessment (Philosophical Content):**
    *   **Scope:** Evaluate specific outputs (analyses, essays) provided via `content_path`.
    *   **Method:** (Requires sophisticated NLU/philosophical understanding)
        *   Assess clarity, coherence, and logical consistency of arguments.
        *   Evaluate the depth of analysis and engagement with philosophical concepts/texts.
        *   Check for appropriate use and citation of evidence/sources.
        *   Identify potential biases, unsupported claims, or superficial treatment of complex issues.
        *   Compare against established philosophical interpretations or standards where applicable.
        *   Reference criteria outlined in Arch V18.3, Sec 4.4 (line 180).
    *   **Output:** Provide a structured assessment summary, highlighting strengths and weaknesses. Store detailed assessment in a `Meta-Reflection` KB entry.

    **5. Proposal Formulation:**
    *   **Basis:** Proposals MUST be directly based on concrete findings from the analysis (rigor issues, log patterns, KB inconsistencies, quality deficits).
    *   **Structure:** Follow the `output_schema.proposals` format.
    *   **Actionability:** Proposals should be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) where possible. Clearly state the problem, the proposed solution, and the expected benefit.
    *   **Targeting:** Clearly identify the target (rule file, KB section, mode behavior, architectural component).
    *   **Rationale:** Provide clear justification linking the finding to the proposed solution.
