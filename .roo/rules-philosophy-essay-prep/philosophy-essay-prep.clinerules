  # Standard Memory Bank Initialization Protocol
  initialization: |
    - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
        <thinking> * Check if phil-memory-bank/ exists. Read if yes, suggest creation if no. </thinking>
        <list_files> <path>phil-memory-bank</path> <recursive>false</recursive> </list_files>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
    # Standard Protocol if No Memory Bank Found
    1. Inform User: "No Memory Bank found at `phil-memory-bank/`..."
    2. Conditional Actions: Offer switch to Architect to create MB structure or proceed in [MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE] state.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
    # Standard Protocol if Memory Bank Exists
    1. Read Global & Active Files: `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `phil-memory-bank/globalContext.md` (WAIT after each)
    2. Read Mode-Specific & Feedback: `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-essay-prep.md`, `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-essay-prep-feedback.md` (WAIT after each, if exists)
    3. Activation: Set status '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]', inform user, apply feedback. **Verify reverse chronological order of logs.**
  update_frequency: |
    # Standard Memory Bank Update Frequency
    UPDATE MEMORY BANK AT THESE POINTS:
    1. At the beginning of each task (read)
    2. **Before calling attempt_completion (perform MANDATORY pre-completion checks: Verification: Ensure the `attempt_completion` message provides a *detailed* summary including: 1) Specific actions taken, 2) Files/resources affected (with paths), 3) Verification steps performed (doc accuracy), 4) Clear status/next steps. The summary must be sufficient for SPARC/user validation without needing to re-read extensive logs. Then write MB updates using batch operations)**
    3. When significant new information is discovered or decisions are made
    4. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
    # Standard Memory Bank Update Process
    1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure. **ALWAYS add new entries to the TOP (reverse chronological order).** Use insert_content/apply_diff appropriately (prefer batching). Avoid overwriting logs, keep concise. Minimize API calls.
    2. File-Specific Updates: Update `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md` (using standard format) and relevant sections in `phil-memory-bank/globalContext.md`. Update `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-essay-prep.md` under appropriate headers (**newest first**). Cross-reference if needed.
  feedback_handling: |
    # Standard Feedback Handling Process
    Save feedback to `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-essay-prep-feedback.md` (**newest first**), document source/issue/action, apply learnings. **IMMEDIATELY log user interventions, explicit corrections, or significant deviations from instructions using the format in the mode-specific Intervention Log (if applicable) or within the feedback file. Include: Trigger, Context, Action Taken, Rationale, Outcome, Follow-up.**

general:
  # Standard Status Prefix Rule
  status_prefix: |
    "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
  # Standard Context Management Rule
  context_management: |
    **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
  # Standard Error Handling Protocol (Includes V2.1 Enhancements)
  error_handling_protocol: |
    # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
    # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
    # 1. Document Thoroughly in `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-essay-prep-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
    # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
    # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

    **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
    1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
    2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
        *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
        *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying. **V2.1 Enhancement:** If `apply_diff` fails with a context mismatch or low similarity: 1. Re-read the target file section using `read_file` with `start_line`/`end_line`. 2. Compare the expected `SEARCH` block with the actual content read. 3. If different, adjust the `SEARCH` block and retry `apply_diff`. 4. If identical, investigate other causes (tool bug?) and consider alternative tools (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`) or escalate per 'Three Strikes' rule.
    3. **Consult MB:** Check `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
    4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
        - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
        - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
        - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
        - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
    5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
    6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
    **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
  # Standard Memory Bank Error Handling Rule
  error_handling: |
    **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
    1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
    2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
    3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]' if context is severely compromised.
    4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
    5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
  # Standard Critical Evaluation Rule
  critical_evaluation: |
    **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.

operational_context_protocols:
  # Adheres to V2.2 Standard & Arch V18.3.5 Section 10
  write_access: "Modes MUST write operational logs ONLY to their designated `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/[mode_slug].md` file using `insert_content` (reverse chrono) or `apply_diff` (targeted updates). Batching recommended."
  read_access: "Modes CAN read any file within `phil-memory-bank/` (global context, other mode logs, feedback) using `read_file` or `search_files` as needed for operational context, guided by `Orchestrator` delegation."
  separation_mandate: "Strict separation MUST be maintained. NO philosophical domain knowledge (KB data) is permitted within `phil-memory-bank/`."

    protocol: |
      1. Before critical writes (`write_to_file`, `apply_diff` on shared files like KB entries): Calculate hash of target file path. Check for `phil-memory-bank/locks/[hash].lock`.
      2. If lock file absent: Create the lock file. Perform write operation on the target file. Delete the lock file.
      3. If lock file present: Wait briefly (e.g., 1-2 seconds), retry check 1-2 times. If still locked, report `CONCURRENCY_CONFLICT` to Orchestrator and await instructions. Do NOT proceed with write.
    scope: "Recommended for writes to shared KB files (theses/, outlines/) where simultaneous access is plausible, though less likely for this mode's specific outputs."
  orchestrator_role: "Orchestrator SHOULD sequence tasks targeting the same critical files whenever feasible."

    strategy: |
      Relies primarily on the specific `concept_ids`, `argument_ids`, and
      `relationship_ids` provided by the Orchestrator via the `input_schema`.
      Uses `read_file` to fetch these specific entries. May supplement with
      `search_files` using `context_tags` if broader context is needed for
      thesis/outline development, strictly within `read_access.allowed_paths`.

    scope_management: "The scope of the thesis and outline should be appropriate for the prompt and supported by the available KB context."
  implementation: |
    When generating 'Thesis' and 'Outline' entries:
    1. Ensure the thesis statement is unambiguous and directly responsive to the prompt.
    2. Populate `thesis_justification` field in the Thesis entry, referencing supporting KB IDs.
    3. Ensure the Outline entry has a clear structure and populate `outline_structure_rationale`, referencing the thesis and supporting KB IDs.
    4. Link key terms in the thesis/outline back to KB Concept entries using `related_ids`.
    5. Log steps taken to ensure determinacy in operational log.

evidence_standards:
  # Adheres to V2.2 Standard
  description: "Standards for grounding the thesis and outline in KB evidence."
  requirements: |
    - **KB Linkage:** The generated thesis and outline entries MUST use the `related_ids` field to explicitly link to the specific KB concept, argument, and relationship entries that provide the core support and justification.
    - **Rigor Field Justification:** The mandatory rigor fields within the thesis (`thesis_justification`) and outline (`outline_structure_rationale`) entries MUST be populated with concise explanations justifying the claims made and the structural choices, referencing the linked KB evidence.

  # Adheres to V2.2 Standard & Arch V18.3.5 Section 8
  integration: "Via `execute_command` tool to interact with Git."
  commit_strategy: |
    Commits should occur after significant milestones (e.g., thesis finalized, outline approved, major draft section completed), typically triggered by the Orchestrator based on workflow state.
    Commit Message Format: "feat(essay-prep): [Action] for [Essay Topic/ID] - [Brief Description]" (e.g., "feat(essay-prep): Finalize thesis for Hegel Spirit Essay - Stored KB ID: thesis_hegel_spirit_001")
  branching: "Work MAY occur on feature branches (e.g., `feature/essay-hegel-spirit`) coordinated by Orchestrator, merging back to main/develop after verification."
  checkpoint_awareness: "Be aware of RooCode Checkpoints (Arch Sec 8.1) for task-level rollback; Git is for persistent, verified changes to essay artifacts (potentially stored in `workspace_management.root`)."
  tool_usage: |
    Use `execute_command` for standard Git operations (`git add [file]`, `git commit -m "[message]"`, `git push`, `git checkout`, `git merge`). Ensure commands are executed in the correct directory (likely workspace root or `workspace_management.root`). Report `GIT_COMMAND_FAIL` on errors.

# --- Informational Section ---
# Core Logic / Workflow (V2.2 Update - Direct Access, Rigor, Git, Explicit Rules)
#   1. Receive input (prompt, KB context) from Orchestrator.
#   2. Query KB using provided IDs and tags (`read_file`, `search_files`) to retrieve relevant concepts, arguments, relationships. Read operational context from `phil-memory-bank/`.
#   3. Analyze retrieved KB data in relation to the prompt.
#   4. Develop a clear, focused thesis statement based on the analysis. Ensure it meets conceptual determinacy guidelines.
#   5. Generate a unique ID for the thesis entry.
#   6. Populate the thesis KB entry, including rigor fields (`thesis_justification`) and linking `related_ids` to supporting KB entries. Ensure schema compliance (V18.3.5).
#   7. Write the thesis entry to `philosophy-knowledge-base/theses/` using `write_to_file`. Handle potential `KB_WRITE_FAIL` or `KB_SCHEMA_VIOLATION`. Apply concurrency lock if necessary.
#   8. Develop a detailed, logically structured outline based on the thesis and supporting KB data.
#   9. Generate a unique ID for the outline entry.
#   10. Populate the outline KB entry, including structure details, `outline_structure_rationale`, and linking `related_ids`. Ensure schema compliance (V18.3.5).
#   11. Write the outline entry to `philosophy-knowledge-base/outlines/` using `write_to_file`. Handle potential `KB_WRITE_FAIL` or `KB_SCHEMA_VIOLATION`. Apply concurrency lock if necessary.
#   12. (Optional, Orchestrator-driven) Execute Git commands (`git add`, `git commit`) via `execute_command` to version control thesis/outline artifacts (potentially stored in `workspace_management.root`).
#   13. If successful, construct success output object with KB entry IDs and summary.
#   14. If any step fails, construct failure output object with appropriate error details.
#   15. Log actions to `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-essay-prep.md`.
#   16. Return output object to Orchestrator.
