  description: |
    Generates draft prose for specific essay sections based on the KB outline entry and relevant KB content (concepts, arguments, relationships). Reads KB entries but does NOT write to the KB. Focuses on clear exposition and argumentation, incorporating evidence links from KB entries.

  # Initialization, update triggers, and general handling are defined globally.
  # Mode-specific updates are handled via operational_logging and feedback logs.

    ### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - [Log Level (INFO|WARN|ERROR)] - [Action/Event]
    - **Details**: [Specific information about the event, e.g., KB IDs queried, section drafted, error details]
    - **Input**: [Relevant input data, e.g., outline_kb_id]
    - **Output**: [Relevant output data, e.g., draft summary, evidence IDs]
    - **Status**: [Current operational status, e.g., Processing, Completed, Failed]
  frequency: |
    - Task Start: Log reception of task from Orchestrator.
    - Input Processing: Log received outline section KB ID and supporting context IDs/tags.
    - KB Interaction: Log specific KB entry IDs read (outlines, concepts, arguments, etc.).
    - Drafting Steps: Log key stages of prose generation for the target section.
    - Output Generation: Log completion of draft section, including summary and evidence references.
    - Task End: Log successful completion or failure state before returning to Orchestrator.

# --- Archetype B Section 5.3: Core Logic / Processing Steps ---
# (Conceptual - Implementation details reside in the mode's code)
# 1. Receive input (outline section ID, context IDs).
# 2. Validate input.
# 3. Query KB: Read the specified outline section entry.
# 4. Query KB: Read relevant context entries (concepts, arguments, relationships, references) using provided IDs and potentially `related_ids` from the outline entry.
# 5. Synthesize Information: Analyze the outline requirements and the content of the fetched KB entries.
# 6. Generate Draft Prose: Construct the essay section text, ensuring logical flow, clear exposition, and accurate representation of KB content.
# 7. Incorporate Evidence: Integrate references to the KB entries used, passing through `source_ref_keys` and `extraction_markers`. Use placeholders like [CITE: kb_id {markers}] where appropriate.
# 8. Format Output: Structure the results according to the output_schema.
# 9. Return Output: Send the structured output to the Orchestrator.

# --- Archetype B Section 5.4: Knowledge Base Interaction Protocols ---
kb_interaction_protocols:
  read_access:
    description: "Defines authorized read access patterns to the Philosophy Knowledge Base."
    allowed_paths:

      - "philosophy-knowledge-base/concepts/"
      - "philosophy-knowledge-base/arguments/"
      - "philosophy-knowledge-base/relationships/"
      - "philosophy-knowledge-base/references/"
      # Add other relevant KB directories if needed
    access_methods:
      - tool: read_file # For direct access using known KB IDs (file paths)
      - tool: search_files # Potentially for finding related entries if IDs aren't exhaustive
    filtering: "Access is typically filtered by specific KB IDs provided in the input or discovered via `related_ids` within read entries."

    allowed_paths: [] # THIS MODE DOES NOT WRITE TO THE KB.
    access_methods: []
  querying:
    description: "Describes how the mode queries the KB."
    strategy: |
      - Primarily uses the `outline_section_kb_id` and `relevant_context_kb_ids` provided in the input.
      - May inspect `related_ids` fields within the read outline/context entries to discover further relevant KB entries if necessary for comprehensive drafting.
      - Uses `read_file` for direct access to entries identified by their KB ID (path).
  kb_doctor_interaction:
    description: "Protocol for handling potential KB issues."
    action: "Reports potential KB inconsistencies (e.g., missing linked entries referenced in `related_ids`, formatting issues preventing parsing) found during read operations to the Orchestrator via the error reporting mechanism (e.g., using `KB_INCONSISTENCY_DETECTED` error code)."

# --- Archetype B Section 5.5: Conceptual Determinacy Guidelines ---
conceptual_determinacy:
  guidelines: |
    - **Clarity:** Drafted prose must use philosophical concepts clearly and consistently, reflecting their definitions and relationships as defined in the source KB entries.
    - **Consistency:** Maintain consistent terminology throughout the drafted section, aligning with the KB. Avoid introducing ambiguity.
    - **Attribution:** Ensure that the conceptual basis for claims is implicitly or explicitly traceable back to the referenced KB entries.
  requirements:
    negative_definition: not_applicable # This mode generates prose, not definitions.
    disambiguation_protocol: required_if_ambiguous_in_source_kb # If a concept read from the KB has noted ambiguities, the draft should reflect or clarify based on context, potentially flagging for review.
    contextual_stability: high # Concepts should be used consistently within the context of the specific essay section being drafted.

# --- Archetype B Section 5.6: Evidence Standards ---
evidence_standards:
  requirements: |
    - **Accuracy:** The drafted prose must accurately reflect the arguments, claims, and evidence presented in the referenced KB entries (arguments, concepts, references).
    - **Traceability:** Must explicitly pass through `source_ref_keys` and `extraction_markers` associated with the KB evidence used. These should be embedded in the `draft_content` (e.g., within citation placeholders) and listed in `evidence_references`.
    - **Relevance:** Only evidence directly supporting the points being made in the drafted section, based on the outline and context, should be included.
  verification_workflow:
    enabled: false # This mode generates the draft; verification happens in subsequent stages (e.g., Reviewer mode).

# --- Archetype B Section 5.7: Tool Usage Restrictions ---
tool_usage_restrictions:
  allowed_tools:
    - read_file # Primary tool for KB access
    - search_files # Secondary tool for KB exploration if needed
    # No other tools (like write_to_file, apply_diff, insert_content on KB) are permitted for KB interaction.
  disallowed_patterns:
    - "Any write operation (`write_to_file`, `apply_diff`, `insert_content`) targeting paths within `philosophy-knowledge-base/`."
    - "Using tools other than `read_file` or `search_files` for KB access."
