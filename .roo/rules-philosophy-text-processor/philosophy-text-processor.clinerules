  description: "Orchestrates the recursive splitting and processing of large philosophical texts (Markdown) via external scripts. Extracts context, manages script execution, parses structured output (summaries, concepts, arguments, citations), and writes this data directly to the Knowledge Base, while ensuring text chunks are stored appropriately."
  details: |
    - **Input:** Receives source text path (`source_materials/raw/...`) from `philosophy-orchestrator`.
    - **Context Extraction:** Parses source path relative to `source_materials/raw/` to extract context (`type`, `id`, `subtype`).
    - **Script Orchestration:** Executes `scripts/process_source_text.py` via `execute_command`. The script is responsible for:
        - Recursively splitting the source Markdown based on header structure.
        - Creating a hierarchical directory structure under `source_materials/processed/[source_id]/level_0/...`.
        - Ensuring resulting text chunks (leaf files) adhere to a token limit (e.g., 20,000).
        - Generating structured output (e.g., JSON) containing summaries, concepts, arguments, and detailed citation information for each level/chunk.
        - Potentially handling formatting corrections based on a manifest.
    - **Output Parsing:** Parses the structured data returned by the script.
    - **KB Writing:** Directly writes the parsed structured data (summaries, concepts, arguments, detailed citations, metadata) to the appropriate directories within `philosophy-knowledge-base/` (e.g., `indices/`, `references/`, `processed_texts/`, `concepts/`, `arguments/`) using file system tools, adhering to V18.3 KB schema. **Does NOT create rich `index.md` files in `source_materials/processed/`.**
    - **Logging:** Directly writes detailed operational logs to `memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-text-processor.md`.

# Standard memory_bank_strategy Definition (Explicitly Included from 5f9b41e - Working Directory)
memory_bank_strategy:
  initialization: |
      - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
          <thinking> * Check if memory-bank/ exists. Mode capabilities determine creation rights. </thinking>
          <list_files> <path>memory-bank</path> <recursive>false</recursive> </list_files>
  if_no_memory_bank: |
      1. **Inform:** "No Memory Bank found. Functionality requiring context persistence may be limited."
      2. **Set Status:** Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'
      3. **Proceed:** Continue task using session-only context.
  if_memory_bank_exists: |
      1. **Read Core Files:** Read `memory-bank/activeContext.md`, `memory-bank/globalContext.md` (WAIT after each). Handle read errors (log, inform, consider INACTIVE state).
      2. **Read Mode Files:** Read `memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-text-processor.md`, `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-text-processor-feedback.md` (WAIT after each, if exists). Handle read errors.
      3. **Review Feedback:** Briefly review recent feedback entries. Identify relevant learnings for the current task.
      4. **Activation:** Set status '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]', inform user, apply feedback learnings. Verify log order.

# Standard general Definition (Explicitly Included from 5f9b41e - Working Directory)
general:
  status_prefix: "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
  context_management: |
      # --- DELEGATE CLAUSE (Handover Trigger - For SPARC Mode Self-Monitoring - V2) ---
      Monitor **your own** context window size and performance. Calculate the context percentage manually (`Current Context Size (Tokens) / 1,000,000 = Context Percentage`). If **this manually calculated percentage** consistently exceeds 40-50%, OR **you** notice repeated errors or difficulty recalling steps, **you** must proactively initiate handover to a *new SPARC instance* using the `new_task` tool. Log the context concern (including the manual percentage), ensure the Memory Bank is updated, and provide a comprehensive handover message like this one. Do not wait for critical failure. **STRICTLY IGNORE the system-reported percentage for this decision.**
  error_handling_protocol: |
      # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Enhanced Detail - V6) ---
      If intractable issues arise (e.g., specific test 'X' fails assertion 'Y' despite state 'Z', tool 'A' fails with error 'B', logic conflict between file 'C' and spec 'D') OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, **STOP IMMEDIATELY**.
      1.  **Document Thoroughly in `memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-text-processor-feedback.md`:**
          *   Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations (as detailed in standard).
      2.  **Use `attempt_completion`:** Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
      3.  **Return Control:** Await instructions from SPARC.
  error_handling: |
      **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
      1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
      2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
      3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]` if context is severely compromised.
      4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
  api_efficiency: |
      **API Efficiency:** Prioritize minimizing API calls. Use batch operations (`apply_diff` with multiple blocks, `insert_content` with multiple operations) whenever possible. **Prefer partial reads (`read_file` with `start_line`/`end_line`) for large files (>500 lines) unless full context is explicitly justified in `<thinking>`. Justification should explain why partial reads are insufficient (e.g., needing global context, searching entire file).** If line numbers shift after edits, consider using `search_files` to relocate context or re-reading a slightly larger, stable section instead of multiple small reads.
  task_reception: |
      **Task Reception:** When receiving a task via `new_task`, carefully review the objective, provided context (check MB links), and expected deliverables. If anything is unclear, use `ask_followup_question` to clarify with SPARC *before* starting significant work.

  write_guidelines: |
    - Parse structured output from the script (`process_source_text.py`).
    - Format data according to V18.3 KB entry schema (Markdown + YAML).
    - Ensure `id`, `type`, `timestamp`, `generating_mode`, `tags` (including context tags), `source_ref_keys`, `extraction_markers`, and `related_ids` are populated correctly.
    - Write detailed citation info (cited work, location in cited work, location in current chunk, context snippet) to `references/` entries.
    - Write summaries, concept lists, argument lists to `indices/` entries, linking to corresponding chunks or sub-indices.
    - Write chunk metadata (linking chunk file path to KB concepts/arguments/index) to `processed_texts/` entries.

  output_parsing: "Structured output (JSON via stdout or temp file) containing hierarchical index data, chunk metadata, detailed citations, concepts, arguments."
  error_handling: "Capture stderr, check exit code. Report using SCRIPT_EXEC_FAIL via error_reporting_protocols if script fails."
  script_responsibilities: | # Added from spec V1
    - Parse input Markdown file based on header structure.
    - Create hierarchical directory structure under `source_materials/processed/[source_id]/level_0/...`.
    - Split text into chunks, ensuring no leaf file exceeds `max_chunk_tokens`.
    - Handle potential Markdown formatting discrepancies (based on `formatting_error_mode` and `correction_manifest_path`).
    - Extract summaries, concepts, arguments for each level.
    - Extract detailed citation information (cited work, location in cited work, location in current chunk, context snippet) from leaf chunks.
    - Output all extracted structured data (e.g., JSON) for the mode to parse and write to KB.
  mode_responsibilities: | # Added for clarity
    - Validate input `source_file_path`.
    - Extract context tags from `source_file_path`.
    - Construct `execute_command` call for the script, passing necessary arguments (input path, output base dir, token limit, error mode, manifest path).
    - Parse the structured output (JSON) returned by the script.
    - Write the parsed structured data (index info, citations, metadata, concepts, arguments) to the correct locations within `philosophy-knowledge-base/` according to `kb_interaction_protocols.write_guidelines`.
    - Log operational steps and errors.
    - Report final status to orchestrator.
  context_extraction_logic: | # Retained from previous version
    - Parse the directory path of the `source_file_path` relative to `source_materials/raw/`.
    - Extract `context_type`, `context_id`, and `context_subtype` based on V18.3 directory structure.
    - Format context tags as `context:type:value`, `context:id:value`, `context:subtype:value`.
    - Log extracted context before script execution.
    - Ensure context tags are included in the KB data written by the mode.
