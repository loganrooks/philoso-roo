  description: |
    Pre-processes source texts from `source_materials/raw/` via external scripts (chunking, indexing, citation extraction).
    Parses input path to extract context (`type`, `id`, `subtype`) based on directory structure relative to `source_materials/raw/`.
    Emphasizes extraction of markers (`extraction_markers`) linking chunks to precise source locations.
    Orchestrates scripts that output processed text chunks to `source_materials/processed/` and write index/citation data directly to the Knowledge Base.

    ### [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - [Log Level] - [Action/Event]
    - **Details**: [Specific information about the event, e.g., script name, file path, parameters, error message, output summary]
    - **Source Path**: [Path to the source file being processed, if applicable]
    - **Extracted Context**: [Context object extracted from path, if applicable]
    - **Script Output**: [Summary of script results, e.g., chunk count, KB IDs, if applicable]
    - **Status**: [Success | Failure | In Progress]
  frequency: |
    - Task Start: Log initiation of processing for a given source file.
    - Input Received: Log the specific `source_file_path` received.
    - Context Extraction: Log the context (`type`, `id`, `subtype`) extracted from the path.
    - Script Execution Start: Log initiation of the processing script, including script name and source path argument.
    - Script Execution End: Log completion status (success/failure) of the script, including exit code and any parsed output summary.
    - Output Summary: Log counts of processed chunks and KB entries reported by the script.
    - Errors Encountered: Log any errors during context extraction, script execution, or output parsing.
    - Task End: Log completion of the processing task for the source file.
  guidelines: |
    - Maintain reverse chronological order (newest entries first).
    - Keep entries concise and focused on the orchestration process.
    - Clearly reference the specific source file path and the script being executed (`scripts/process_source_text.py`).
    - Emphasize the context extraction step and the resulting context object.
    - Record summaries provided by the script regarding outputs (chunks, KB entries).

  kb_doctor_interaction: |
    If the processing script reports a failure during its KB write operations (e.g., schema validation error, connection issue), this mode will:
    1. Log the failure reported by the script.
    2. Include the `KB_WRITE_FAIL` error code in its error report to the Orchestrator.
    3. Suggest in the error details that the Knowledge Base integrity might be compromised and recommend invoking the `philosophy-kb-doctor` mode for diagnosis and repair.

script_execution:
  script_path: "scripts/process_source_text.py"
  execution_method: "execute_command"
  input_format: |
    The `source_file_path` is passed as a command-line argument to the script.
    Example: `python scripts/process_source_text.py source_materials/raw/primary_source/hegel_phenomenology/introduction/section_1.md`
  output_parsing: |
    - **Success/Failure:** Determined primarily by the script's exit code (0 for success, non-zero for failure).
    - **Results:** The script is expected to print a JSON object to standard output upon successful completion. This JSON should contain:
      - `status`: "success"
      - `processed_chunk_path`: Path to the output directory.
      - `kb_index_entry_id`: ID of the created index entry (if any).
      - `kb_citation_entry_ids`: Array of created citation entry IDs (if any).
      - `summary`: A string summarizing actions (e.g., chunk count, KB entries created).
    - This mode will parse this JSON output to populate its own `output_schema`.
  error_handling: |
    - If the script returns a non-zero exit code, report `SCRIPT_EXEC_FAIL`.
    - If the script exits successfully (code 0) but its stdout cannot be parsed as the expected JSON structure, report `OUTPUT_VALIDATION_FAIL`.
    - If the script's JSON output indicates an internal failure (e.g., `status: "failure"` within the JSON, or specific error details related to KB writing), report the relevant error code (`KB_WRITE_FAIL` or `SCRIPT_EXEC_FAIL` with details).
    - Capture stderr from the script execution and include it in the `error_details` for `SCRIPT_EXEC_FAIL`.

context_extraction_rules:
  purpose: "To derive structured context (`type`, `id`, `subtype`) from the directory path of the source file, relative to the `source_materials/raw/` directory, following the conventions outlined in Architecture V18.3, Section 3."
  rules: |
    The expected directory structure under `source_materials/raw/` is:
    `source_materials/raw/<context_type>/<context_id>/<context_subtype>/<filename.ext>`

    Where:
    1.  `<context_type>`: Represents the broad category of the source material.
        - Examples: `primary_source`, `secondary_lit`, `lecture`, `notes`.
        - Extracted Value: The first directory name immediately under `raw/`.
        - Output Tag: `context:type:<value>` (e.g., `context:type:primary_source`)

    2.  `<context_id>`: Represents the specific work, author, or date identifier.
        - Examples: `hegel_phenomenology`, `pippin_realm_of_shadows`, `2025-03-11_lecture`.
        - Extracted Value: The second directory name.
        - Output Tag: `context:id:<value>` (e.g., `context:id:hegel_phenomenology`)

    3.  `<context_subtype>`: Represents a specific part, chapter, section, or topic within the work/ID.
        - Examples: `introduction`, `chapter_1`, `preface`, `section_ss483-487`.
        - Extracted Value: The third directory name.
        - Output Tag: `context:subtype:<value>` (e.g., `context:subtype:introduction`)

    4.  `<filename.ext>`: The actual source file. This is used for processing but not directly part of the extracted context object structure, though it's implicitly linked.

    **Processing Logic:**
    - The mode receives the full `source_file_path`.
    - It validates that the path starts with `source_materials/raw/`.
    - It splits the path relative to `source_materials/raw/` into segments.
    - It assigns the first segment to `type`, the second to `id`, and the third to `subtype`.
    - If the path structure does not contain at least three segments after `raw/`, it results in a `CONTEXT_EXTRACTION_FAIL` error.
    - The extracted `type`, `id`, and `subtype` are populated into the `extracted_context` object in the `output_schema`.
