      2. If lock file absent: Create the lock file. Perform write operation on the target file. Delete the lock file.
      3. If lock file present: Wait briefly (e.g., 1-2 seconds), retry check 1-2 times. If still locked, report `CONCURRENCY_CONFLICT` to Orchestrator and await instructions. Do NOT proceed with write.
    scope: "Recommended for writes to shared KB files (e.g., updating existing Question entries if multiple modes could target them)."

# --- 5.4. KB Interaction Protocols (Mandatory & Detailed for Archetype B) ---
kb_interaction_protocols:
  # Adheres to Archetype B KB Interaction Protocols V2.0 defined in docs/standards/clinerules_standard_v2.md Section 5.4
  # Utilizes Direct KB Access patterns (V18.3.4 Arch)
  read_access:
    - "philosophy-knowledge-base/questions/" # Read proto-questions
    - "philosophy-knowledge-base/concepts/" # Read related concepts
    - "philosophy-knowledge-base/arguments/" # Read related arguments
    - "philosophy-knowledge-base/relationships/" # Read relationships for context
  write_access:
    - "philosophy-knowledge-base/questions/" # Write refined questions
  querying: |
    Use `read_file` to retrieve specific proto-question entries by ID.
    Use `search_files` with regex targeting YAML frontmatter fields (id, type, tags, related_ids) in concepts/, arguments/, relationships/ to find context relevant to proto-questions.
    Apply `context_tags` from input schema as filters in `search_files` regex or post-read filtering logic.
    Follow relationship links (`related_ids`) from proto-questions or context entries to gather further relevant information.
    Avoid reading entire KB directories; use targeted reads and searches.
  kb_maintenance_interaction: "If KB inconsistencies (broken links, schema violations, conflicting info related to questions/concepts) detected during R/W, report details (e.g., KB_SCHEMA_VIOLATION, MISSING_DEPENDENCY) to Orchestrator, suggesting MetaReflector/VerificationAgent review."
  validation_hooks: "Mode SHOULD attempt self-validation of refined Question entries against schemas in `philosophy-knowledge-base/_operational/formatting_templates_rules/` before writing. `VerificationAgent` may perform post-write checks if part of the workflow."
  rigor_field_handling: "When creating refined Question entries, populate relevant rigor fields (e.g., `presuppositions`, `ambiguities` identified during refinement) per Arch Doc Sec 6. Link back to original proto-question using `related_ids`."

# --- 5.5. Conceptual Determinacy (Guideline Section - Adaptable) ---
conceptual_determinacy:
  # Adheres to Archetype B Conceptual Determinacy guidelines defined in docs/standards/clinerules_standard_v2.md Section 5.5
  requirements:
    clarity: required # Refined questions must be clear and unambiguous.
    scope: required # Refined questions should have a well-defined scope.
    presupposition_awareness: recommended # Identify and potentially make explicit key presuppositions.
  implementation: |
    When refining questions:
    1. Analyze proto-questions and related KB context for ambiguity or excessive breadth.
    2. Reword questions for clarity and precision.
    3. Break down overly broad questions into multiple, focused inquiries.
    4. Identify key presuppositions underlying the question and consider if they need explicit mention or refinement. Populate `presuppositions` field in the refined Question KB entry.
    5. If ambiguity is resolved, note this in the `analysis_summary` output and potentially the `ambiguities` field (e.g., "Resolved ambiguity regarding 'X' by focusing on Y").
    6. Ensure the refined question's scope is appropriate for philosophical investigation.
    7. Log steps taken to ensure determinacy in the operational log.

# --- 5.6. Evidence Standards (Guideline Section + Strict Workflow) ---
evidence_standards:
  # Adheres to Archetype B Evidence Standards guidelines defined in docs/standards/clinerules_standard_v2.md Section 5.6
  requirements:
    source_linkage: recommended # Refined questions should ideally link to concepts/arguments (`related_ids`) that are themselves linked to evidence (`source_ref_keys`).
    contextual_grounding: required # Refinement must be grounded in the analysis of proto-questions and related KB context.
  verification_workflow:
    enabled: false # This mode primarily refines questions, not verifies claims against evidence directly. Verification happens elsewhere (e.g., VerificationAgent on essay drafts).
