    4. On explicit "Update Memory Bank" or "UMB" command
  update_process: |
    # Standard Memory Bank Update Process V2.5
    1. For all updates: Include timestamp, descriptive titles, maintain structure. **ALWAYS add new entries to the TOP (reverse chronological order).** Use insert_content/apply_diff appropriately (prefer batching). Avoid overwriting logs, keep concise. Minimize API calls.
    2. File-Specific Updates: Update `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md` (using standard format) and relevant sections in `phil-memory-bank/globalContext.md`. Update `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-questioning.md` under appropriate headers (**newest first**). Cross-reference if needed.

    # Standard Feedback Handling Process V2.5
    Save feedback to `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-questioning-feedback.md` (**newest first**), document source/issue/action, apply learnings. **IMMEDIATELY log user interventions, explicit corrections, or significant deviations from instructions using the format in the mode-specific Intervention Log (if applicable, see operational_logging) or within the feedback file. Include: Trigger, Context, Action Taken, Rationale, Outcome, Follow-up.**

general:
  # Adheres to standard general rules defined in docs/standards/clinerules_standard_v2.md
  status_prefix: |
    # Standard Status Prefix Rule V2.5
    "Begin EVERY response with either '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' or '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]', according to the current state of the Memory Bank."
  context_management: |
    # Standard Context Management Rule V2.5
    **Proactive Context Management:** During complex or long-running tasks, be mindful of context window limitations. If you notice degraded performance, repeated errors, or difficulty recalling previous steps, **proactively suggest using `new_task` to delegate the remaining work with a clear handover**, rather than waiting for critical failure or user intervention. Explicitly state context concerns as the reason for suggesting delegation.
  error_handling_protocol: |
    # Standard Error Handling Protocol V2.5
    # --- EARLY RETURN CLAUSE (Placeholder - Specific modes might override) ---
    # If intractable issues arise OR context limits (~40-50%) are approached, STOP IMMEDIATELY.
    # 1. Document Thoroughly in `phil-memory-bank/feedback/philosophy-questioning-feedback.md` (Blocker, Progress, Attempts, Analysis, Self-Correction, Context %, Recommendations).
    # 2. Use `attempt_completion`: Summarize blocker, state Early Return invoked, reference feedback log.
    # 3. Return Control: Await instructions.

    **Structured Error Handling:** If a tool use fails or an unexpected error occurs:
    1. **Log:** Clearly state the error encountered.
    2. **Analyze:** Briefly analyze the potential cause (e.g., incorrect parameters, file access issue, API error, context mismatch). Check tool documentation/schema if applicable.
        *   **For `read_file`:** Explicitly check the result for the truncation notice (`Showing only X of Y lines...`). If found, and if the task might require full context (e.g., applying diffs, comprehensive analysis), mandate either re-reading with specific line ranges covering the needed area or asking the user for confirmation before proceeding with potentially incomplete data.
        *   **For `apply_diff` failures:** Mandate checking for context mismatch (due to truncation/prior edits) or "identical content" errors *first*. Suggest specific actions like re-reading the section or using `search_files` to verify context before retrying. If `apply_diff` fails with a context mismatch or low similarity: 1. Re-read the target file section using `read_file` with `start_line`/`end_line`. 2. Compare the expected `SEARCH` block with the actual content read. 3. If different, adjust the `SEARCH` block and retry `apply_diff`. 4. If identical, investigate other causes (tool bug?) and consider alternative tools (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`) or escalate per 'Three Strikes' rule.
    3. **Consult MB:** Check `phil-memory-bank/activeContext.md` and relevant mode-specific logs (e.g., `debug.md`) for recent similar errors or known issues.
    4. **Propose Solution:** Based on analysis, propose a *specific* next step:
        - Retry the tool with corrected parameters (if analysis suggests parameter error).
        - Use a different tool to gather more info (e.g., `read_file`, `list_files`).
        - Ask the user a *targeted* question via `ask_followup_question` if specific information is missing.
        - Suggest delegating to `debug` mode if the cause is unclear.
    5. **"Three Strikes" Rule:** After 2-3 *consecutive* failures of the *same tool* on the *same target*, mandate a strategy change. Choose one: attempt an alternative tool (`insert_content`, `search_and_replace`, cautious `write_to_file`), use MCPs (`fetcher`, `brave-search`) for research, ask the user a targeted question, delegate to `debug`, or invoke Early Return. Explicitly forbid further simple retries.
    6. **Intervention Handling:** If an error leads to user intervention, ensure the intervention is logged according to the updated `feedback_handling` rule *before* proceeding with the user's correction or the next step.
    **Avoid generic retries or immediately asking the user "What should I do?" without performing this analysis.**
  error_handling: |
    # Standard Memory Bank Error Handling Rule V2.5
    **Memory Bank Error Handling:** If any Memory Bank operation (`list_files`, `read_file`, `insert_content`, `apply_diff`) fails:
    1. Log the error clearly in the chat.
    2. Inform the user about the failure and potential impact on context.
    3. Consider switching to `[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]' if context is severely compromised.
    4. Suggest running `memory-bank-doctor` if corruption is suspected.
    5. If corruption is confirmed, delegate repair to `memory-bank-doctor` mode using `new_task`.
  critical_evaluation: |
    # Standard Critical Evaluation Rule V2.5
    **Rule: Critical Evaluation.** When encountering contradictory evidence or persistent failures, *critically evaluate prior diagnoses or assumptions*, especially those made under high context (>40%). State this evaluation explicitly in `<thinking>` before proceeding.
  api_efficiency: |
    # Standard API Efficiency Guidelines V2.5
    **API Efficiency:** Prioritize minimizing API calls. Use batch operations (`apply_diff` with multiple blocks, `insert_content` with multiple operations) whenever possible. **Prefer partial reads (`read_file` with `start_line`/`end_line`) for large files (>500 lines) unless full context is explicitly justified in `<thinking>`. Justification should explain why partial reads are insufficient (e.g., needing global context, searching entire file).** If line numbers shift after edits, consider using `search_files` to relocate context or re-reading a slightly larger, stable section instead of multiple small reads.
  task_reception: |
    # Standard Task Reception Guidelines V2.5
    **Task Reception:** When receiving a task via `new_task`, carefully review the objective, provided context (check MB links), and expected deliverables. If anything is unclear, use `ask_followup_question` to clarify with SPARC *before* starting significant work.

operational_context_protocols:
  # Adheres to Standard Operational Context Protocols V2.5
  write_access: "Modes MUST write operational logs ONLY to their designated `phil-memory-bank/mode-specific/philosophy-questioning.md` file using `insert_content` (reverse chrono) or `apply_diff` (targeted updates). Batching recommended."
  read_access: "Modes CAN read any file within `phil-memory-bank/` (global context, other mode logs, feedback) using `read_file` or `search_files` as needed for operational context, guided by `Orchestrator` delegation."
  separation_mandate: "Strict separation MUST be maintained. NO philosophical domain knowledge (KB data) is permitted within `phil-memory-bank/`."

  frequency: "Log task start/end, major sub-steps (KB query, analysis, refinement, KB store), all KB R/W ops, MCP calls (if any), errors, interventions."
  guidelines: "Maintain reverse chronological order. Be concise. Focus on operational actions, use KB IDs. Do not duplicate KB content. Recommend batching log entries before writing via `insert_content`."

error_reporting_protocols:
  # Adheres to Standard Error Reporting Protocol V2.5
  reporting_target: "Return structured error object to Orchestrator."
  error_codes:
    KB_READ_FAIL: "Knowledge Base Read Failure"

  escalation: "Follow standard SPARC error handling protocol (retries, three strikes, debug delegation, early return)."

mcp_interaction_protocols:
  # Adheres to Standard MCP Interaction Protocol V2.5
  strategy_reference: "Adheres to 'Distributed MCP Calls' strategy defined in `docs/blueprints/mcp_integration_v1.md`."
  allowed_tools:
    - server_name: "brave-search" # Example: if needing to find external context for a question
      tool_name: "brave_web_search"
    - server_name: "fetcher" # Example: if needing to fetch content from a URL found
      tool_name: "fetch_url"

  error_handling: "Report MCP failures using `MCP_TOOL_FAIL` or `MCP_SERVER_UNAVAILABLE` via `error_reporting_protocols`. Follow standard escalation. Consider tool-specific retry logic if appropriate."
  usage_guidelines: |
    Use 'brave_web_search' sparingly to find external definitions or discussions that might help clarify ambiguities or scope for a proto-question, especially if KB context is insufficient.
    Use 'fetch_url' to retrieve content from specific academic URLs if found via search and deemed highly relevant for question refinement.
    Prioritize KB internal context first.

concurrency_coordination_protocols:
  # Adheres to Standard Concurrency Coordination Protocol V2.5
  risk_acknowledgment: "Direct file access by multiple modes introduces risks (race conditions, data corruption). These protocols aim to mitigate, but not eliminate, these risks. Adherence by all modes is critical."
  locking_mechanism:
    type: "Advisory File Locking"
    lock_file_location: "phil-memory-bank/locks/"
    lock_file_naming: "[file_path_hash].lock (e.g., MD5 hash of relative path)"
    protocol: |
      1. Before critical writes (`write_to_file`, `apply_diff` on shared KB files like Question entries): Calculate hash of target file path. Check for `phil-memory-bank/locks/[hash].lock`.
      2. If lock file absent: Create the lock file. Perform write operation on the target file. Delete the lock file.
      3. If lock file present: Wait briefly (e.g., 1-2 seconds), retry check 1-2 times. If still locked, report `CONCURRENCY_CONFLICT` to Orchestrator and await instructions. Do NOT proceed with write.
    scope: "Recommended for writes to shared KB files (e.g., creating/updating Question entries in `philosophy-knowledge-base/questions/`)."
  orchestrator_role: "Orchestrator SHOULD sequence tasks targeting the same critical files whenever feasible."

  write_access:
    - "philosophy-knowledge-base/questions/" # Write new/updated refined questions
    - "philosophy-knowledge-base/relationships/" # Potentially to link refined questions to new insights
  schema_enforcement: "All writes MUST strictly adhere to the KB entry schemas defined in Arch V18.3.6 Appendix A. Validate structure before writing."
  relationship_mandate: "New/refined Question entries SHOULD be linked to original proto-questions and relevant concepts/arguments via the `related_ids` field. Orphaned entries are discouraged."
  rigor_fields_population: "Modes MUST populate relevant rigor fields (e.g., `presuppositions`, `ambiguities` identified/resolved, `scope_of_question`, `question_type`) in refined Question KB entries, as defined in Arch V18.3.6 Appendix A."
  verification_hooks: "Modes MUST check for and respect verification status flags (`verification_status`, `verified_by`, `verification_date`) in related KB entries. New refined questions are typically `Unverified` initially."
  maintenance_reporting: "Report suspected KB inconsistencies (e.g., a proto-question linked to a non-existent concept) or schema violations to `Orchestrator` for potential delegation to `MetaReflector` or `VerificationAgent`."

conceptual_determinacy_guidelines:
  # Adheres to Archetype B Conceptual Determinacy guidelines (Standard V2.5)
  definition_standard: "Refined questions must be phrased with clear, unambiguous language. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice, unless technical precision is essential and defined by linked concepts."
  scope_management: "Ensure refined questions have a well-defined scope, neither too broad for meaningful inquiry nor too narrow to be trivial. If a proto-question is too broad, break it into multiple, focused refined questions."
  ambiguity_identification: "Analyze proto-questions and related KB concepts/arguments for ambiguous terms or phrasing. Consult `source_materials/processed/` if ambiguity stems from source interpretation."
  disambiguation_methods: |
    Employ methods like:
    - **Contextual Analysis:** Examine how terms in the proto-question are used within linked KB entries or source texts (via `source_materials/processed/` navigation).
    - **KB Search:** Look for existing definitions or distinctions for ambiguous terms in `philosophy-knowledge-base/concepts/`.
    - **Reframing:** Rephrase the question to eliminate ambiguous terms or to specify a particular sense of a term.
    - **Specification:** Add clauses to the question that specify the context or limits of the inquiry.
    Document methods used in operational logs and `analysis_summary`.
  marking_ambiguity: "If an ambiguity in a *refined* question cannot be fully resolved but is intentionally retained (e.g., for heuristic purposes), note this in the Question KB entry's `ambiguities` field and explain the rationale. Proto-question ambiguities should be resolved or lead to multiple refined questions."
  sense_tracking: "If a key term in a question can have multiple senses (as per KB concepts), ensure the refined question targets a specific sense or explicitly acknowledges the different senses it might engage."
  consistency_checks: "Ensure refined questions are logically consistent with the KB entries they are linked to (via `related_ids`). Report unresolved inconsistencies via `maintenance_reporting`."

evidence_standards:
  # Adheres to Archetype B Evidence Standards guidelines (Standard V2.5)
  source_preference: "N/A for direct evidence gathering. However, refinement should be informed by the evidence backing related concepts/arguments in the KB. This mode may consult `source_materials/processed/` (navigating via `index.md` files) to understand the textual basis of related KB items if crucial for question refinement."
  evaluation_criteria: "N/A for direct evidence evaluation. Evaluate clarity, focus, and potential for fruitful inquiry of the *questions themselves* based on KB context and source material understanding."
  linking_mechanism: |
    Refined Question KB entries SHOULD use `related_ids` to link to:
    - The original proto-question(s).
    - Key concepts or arguments that inform the refined question.
    These linked concepts/arguments, in turn, adhere to the strict `source_ref_keys` and `extraction_markers` linking to `source_materials/processed/` as per their own `evidence_standards`.
  verification_requirement: "Refined questions themselves are not 'verified' in the same way as claims. However, their clarity, relevance, and grounding in KB context can be reviewed by `MetaReflector` or user."
