# Conceptual Development Hypotheses - Sense-Certainty

## Methodological Application

### Framework from Introduction
1. **Immanent Development**
   - How consciousness examines itself
   - Standards internal to sense-certainty
   - Self-undermining through own criteria

2. **For Us vs For Consciousness**
   - What appears to sense-certainty
   - What we observe in its development
   - Relationship between perspectives

3. **Necessary Progression**
   - Why movement to Perception necessary
   - How dialectic generates new shape
   - Role of determinate negation

## Key Concepts

### This/Here/Now
1. Initial Appearance
   - Immediate particulars
   - Supposedly richest knowledge
   - Direct sensuous certainty

2. Expected Development
   - Reveal universal character
   - Show internal mediation
   - Demonstrate necessity of relations

3. Anticipated Resolution
   - Transform into perception
   - Generate new conceptual structure
   - Preserve truth through negation

### Subject-Object Relation
1. Starting Point
   - Immediate knowing
   - Direct relation to object
   - Simple presence

2. Predicted Development
   - Reveal mediations
   - Show interdependence
   - Demonstrate universality

3. Expected Outcome
   - More complex relationship
   - Recognition of mediation
   - New form of consciousness

## Developmental Stages

### Stage 1: Immediate Certainty
1. Characteristics
   - Direct sensuous knowledge
   - Apparent richness
   - Seeming truth

2. Internal Tensions
   - Particular vs universal
   - Immediate vs mediated
   - Being vs meaning

3. Expected Movement
   - From richness to poverty
   - From immediate to mediate
   - From particular to universal

### Stage 2: Dialectical Movement
1. This/Here/Now
   - Temporal change
   - Spatial variation
   - Universal persistence

2. Subject-Object
   - Mutual dependence
   - Essential relation
   - Necessary mediation

3. Language
   - Universal expression
   - Impossibility of particular
   - Truth in universality

### Stage 3: Transition to Perception
1. Recognition
   - Mediated nature of knowledge
   - Universal character of truth
   - Need for new shape

2. Necessity
   - Internal development
   - Logical progression
   - Systematic advance

3. New Shape
   - Preserve truth of sense-certainty
   - Transform through negation
   - Generate richer structure

## Expected Connections

### To Introduction
1. Method
   - Application of framework
   - Demonstration of necessity
   - Role of observation

2. Truth
   - Development through experience
   - Preservation in negation
   - Progressive enrichment

3. Knowledge
   - Self-examination process
   - Internal criteria
   - Systematic development

### To Later Development
1. Perception
   - More complex structure
   - Richer determination
   - New problems

2. Understanding
   - Further mediation
   - Greater complexity
   - Deeper truth

3. Self-Consciousness
   - Growing self-awareness
   - Increased reflection
   - Subject-object unity

## Questions to Track

1. Methodological
   - How exactly does self-undermining work?
   - What makes progression necessary?
   - Role of language in development?

2. Conceptual
   - Nature of universality revealed?
   - Relationship to later shapes?
   - Status of immediate knowledge?

3. Systematic
   - Connection to whole system?
   - Role in consciousness's education?
   - Relationship to absolute knowing?
