# Integration Verification Report - Hegel Philosophy Suite V11

**Date:** 2025-05-01
**Architecture Version:** 11.0 (`architecture_v11.md`)
**Verifier Mode:** Architect

## 1. Objective

This report details the verification process for ensuring consistency between the implemented mode configuration (`.roo/.roomodes`), individual mode rules (`.roo/rules-*/philosophy-*.clinerules`), and the V11 architecture specification (`architecture_v11.md`).

## 2. Scope

The following assets were reviewed:

*   `architecture_v11.md` (Specification Document)
*   `.roo/.roomodes` (Mode Configuration File)
*   `.roo/rules-philosophy-class-analysis/philosophy-class-analysis.clinerules`
*   `.roo/rules-philosophy-dialectical-analysis/philosophy-dialectical-analysis.clinerules`
*   `.roo/rules-philosophy-essay-prep/philosophy-essay-prep.clinerules`
*   `.roo/rules-philosophy-pre-lecture/philosophy-pre-lecture.clinerules`
*   `.roo/rules-philosophy-secondary-lit/philosophy-secondary-lit.clinerules`
*   `.roo/rules-philosophy-orchestrator/philosophy-orchestrator.clinerules`
*   `.roo/rules-philosophy-evidence-manager/philosophy-evidence-manager.clinerules`
*   `.roo/rules-philosophy-draft-generator/philosophy-draft-generator.clinerules`
*   `.roo/rules-philosophy-citation-manager/philosophy-citation-manager.clinerules`
*   `.roo/rules-philosophy-verification-agent/philosophy-verification-agent.clinerules`
*   Memory Bank Context (`activeContext.md`, `globalContext.md`, `architect.md`)

## 3. Verification Process

1.  **File Presence Confirmation:** Confirmed the existence of all 10 expected philosophy-related `.clinerules` files within their respective `.roo/rules-*/` directories, based on Memory Bank logs and targeted `list_files` checks.
2.  **Mode Configuration Review:** Read and verified the `.roo/.roomodes` file. Confirmed it correctly lists all 10 philosophy modes with accurate slugs and paths to their corresponding `.clinerules` files.
3.  **Individual Rule File Review:** Systematically read each of the 10 `.clinerules` files listed above. Compared the following aspects against `architecture_v11.md`:
    *   **Responsibility:** Checked if the mode's described purpose aligns with the specification.
    *   **Capabilities:** Verified if the allowed tools and restrictions match the mode's role and interactions.
    *   **Workflows:** Assessed if the defined workflows accurately reflect the processes described in the architecture, including delegation patterns (`new_task`) and interaction sequences.
    *   **Memory Interactions:** Confirmed that interactions with the `knowledge_base` are correctly routed through `philosophy-evidence-manager` (directly or via orchestrator delegation) and that local context management is appropriate.
    *   **Mode Transitions/Triggers:** Verified that handoffs, task reception, and reporting align with the orchestration pattern defined in V11 (primarily interacting with `philosophy-orchestrator`).
    *   **Knowledge Base Interactions:** Specifically checked how each mode queries or contributes data to the KB, ensuring consistency with the `evidence-manager` interface.

## 4. Findings

**No inconsistencies were identified.**

*   The `.roo/.roomodes` file accurately reflects the 10 modes defined in `architecture_v11.md`.
*   Each reviewed `.clinerules` file demonstrated consistency with the V11 architecture regarding:
    *   Defined responsibilities.
    *   Appropriate capabilities and toolsets.
    *   Workflow logic, including delegation via `new_task` where specified.
    *   Correct interaction patterns with the `knowledge_base` via `philosophy-evidence-manager` (or delegation through `philosophy-orchestrator`).
    *   Mode transition logic aligned with the central orchestration pattern.

## 5. Conclusion

The implemented mode configurations (`.roomodes` and `.clinerules` files) for the Hegel Philosophy Suite are **verified as consistent** with the `architecture_v11.md` specification. The system appears correctly configured according to the V11 design.

**Phase 3, Step 2: Verify Mode Integration is complete.**
