# Recommendation for Jan28 Pre-Lecture Preparation

## Analysis of Reading Requirements

After examining both Pippin's chapter 3 ("The Concept") and the Jan28 reading assignment (Hegel's Science of Logic pp49-58), I recommend the following approach for preparing for the Jan28 pre-lecture analysis.

### Jan28 Reading Focus

The Jan28 reading focuses on:
1. The beginning of the Doctrine of Being
2. The circular nature of Hegel's system
3. The justification for beginning with pure being
4. The relationship between being, nothing, and becoming
5. The division of being into quality, quantity, and measure

This reading continues directly from where we left off in the Jan21 material, moving from the methodological introduction into the actual beginning of the Logic's content with the category of Being.

### Relevance of Pippin's Chapter 3

Pippin's chapter 3 on "The Concept" focuses on:
1. The nature of the Concept as conceptuality itself
2. The Concept as the principle of intelligibility
3. The relationship between the Concept and objects
4. The Concept as apperceptive spontaneity
5. The Concept as Hegel's version of the Absolute

While this chapter contains valuable insights into Hegel's overall project, it deals with material that appears much later in Hegel's Logic, after the Doctrine of Being and the Doctrine of Essence. The Concept (der Begriff) represents a much more developed and concrete category than the pure being that is the focus of the Jan28 reading.

## Recommendation

**I do not recommend reading Pippin's chapter 3 at this stage** for the following reasons:

1. **Chronological Mismatch**: The Jan28 reading deals with the very beginning of Hegel's Logic (pure being), while Pippin's chapter 3 deals with the Concept, which appears much later in the logical development.

2. **Potential Confusion**: Introducing the complex themes of the Concept before working through the more basic categories of being, nothing, and becoming could create confusion about the dialectical progression of Hegel's system.

3. **Pedagogical Sequence**: Following Hegel's own sequence is important for understanding how each category emerges from the previous ones. Jumping ahead to the Concept would disrupt this pedagogical progression.

4. **Essay Preparation**: For the essay on Being and Nothing, focusing on the immediate context of these categories is more directly relevant than exploring the Concept.

## Alternative Recommendation

Instead of reading Pippin's chapter 3, I recommend:

1. **Continue with Pippin's chapter 2**: The material we've already analyzed from chapter 2 on "Logic and Metaphysics" provides sufficient context for understanding the beginning of the Logic and the relationship between being and nothing.

2. **Focus on the Jan28 reading itself**: A careful reading of Hegel's own text on the beginning of the Doctrine of Being will be most valuable for understanding his argument about why the Logic must begin with pure being and how it relates to nothing.

3. **Review our analysis of the Jan21 material**: Our work on the transition from Phenomenology to Logic provides the necessary background for understanding why Hegel begins the Logic with pure being.

4. **Prepare specific questions about Being and Nothing**: In light of the essay prompt, formulate specific questions about the relationship between being and nothing that can guide our reading of the Jan28 material.

## Connection to Essay Preparation

This approach will better support preparation for the essay on Being and Nothing by:

1. Maintaining focus on the specific categories at issue in the essay
2. Following Hegel's own dialectical development of these categories
3. Building a solid foundation before moving to more complex concepts
4. Allowing for a deeper understanding of why Being both is and is not Nothing

We can always return to Pippin's chapter 3 later in the course when we reach the Doctrine of the Concept in Hegel's Logic, at which point it will be more immediately relevant and comprehensible.
