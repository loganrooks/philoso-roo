Date: March 6, 2025
Target Course Date: January 14, 2025

## 1. Starting Points

### A. Phenomenology (Sense-Certainty)
1. Beginning Structure:
   - Takes up natural consciousness
   - Starts with concrete claim
   - "Now is Night"

2. Method Requirements:
   - Accept consciousness's claim
   - Follow its experience
   - Record its learning

3. Role of "We":
   - Observe movement
   - Record experience
   - See necessity

### B. Logic (Pure Being)
1. Beginning Structure:
   - Takes up pure thought
   - Starts with pure content
   - "Being, pure being"

2. Method Requirements:
   - Think pure content
   - Follow internal development
   - See conceptual necessity

3. Role of "We":
   - Think along with
   - Follow necessity
   - Comprehend movement

## 2. Movement Structure

### A. Phenomenology
1. Movement Type:
   - Through experience
   - Via testing claims
   - Learning from failure

2. Necessity Source:
   - Contradiction in experience
   - Gap between claim and truth
   - Educational development

3. Result Form:
   - New shape of consciousness
   - Higher understanding
   - Progress toward truth

### B. Logic
1. Movement Type:
   - Through thought determination
   - Via internal relations
   - Conceptual development

2. Necessity Source:
   - Internal to thought content
   - Conceptual relations
   - Systematic requirements

3. Result Form:
   - New thought determination
   - More concrete category
   - Systematic development

## 3. Truth Structure

### A. Phenomenology
1. Truth Emerges Through:
   - Testing claims
   - Experiencing failure
   - Learning from experience

2. Truth Takes Form Of:
   - New understanding
   - Better grasp
   - Higher standpoint

3. Truth Verified By:
   - Experience itself
   - Consciousness's learning
   - Our observation

### B. Logic
1. Truth Emerges Through:
   - Internal development
   - Conceptual necessity
   - Systematic relation

2. Truth Takes Form Of:
   - More concrete determination
   - Fuller category
   - Systematic connection

3. Truth Verified By:
   - Thought itself
   - Conceptual necessity
   - Systematic coherence

## 4. Reading Implications

### A. For Phenomenology
1. Key Focus:
   - Track experience
   - Note learning
   - See development

2. Method Requirements:
   - Follow consciousness
   - Record movement
   - Understand necessity

3. Success Criteria:
   - Clear movement map
   - Educational path shown
   - Necessity demonstrated

### B. For Logic
1. Key Focus:
   - Track thought content
   - Note relations
   - See system

2. Method Requirements:
   - Think purely
   - Follow necessity
   - See connections

3. Success Criteria:
   - Clear concept analysis
   - Necessity shown
   - System developed

## 5. Integration Points

### A. Systematic Connection
1. Phenomenology:
   - Leads to pure thought
   - Through experience
   - To absolute knowing

2. Logic:
   - Takes up pure thought
   - Develops systematically
   - Shows full truth

### B. Method Unity
1. Common Features:
   - Necessary development
   - Truth emergence
   - Systematic connection

2. Key Differences:
   - Mode of movement
   - Source of necessity
   - Form of truth

## 6. Reading Strategy

### A. For Both Texts
1. First Reading:
   - Track movement type
   - Note necessity source
   - See development

2. Second Reading:
   - Map full structure
   - Show connections
   - Understand system

### B. Key Questions
1. For Movement:
   - How does it work here?
   - Why necessary?
   - What results?

2. For Truth:
   - How emerges?
   - Why valid?
   - What shows?
