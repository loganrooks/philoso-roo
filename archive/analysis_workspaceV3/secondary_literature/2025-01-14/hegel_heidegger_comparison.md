Date: March 6, 2025
Target Course Date: January 14, 2025

## 1. Treatment of Immediacy

### Hegel's Approach
- Begins with immediacy as starting point (ยง90)
- Focuses on dialectical movement through experience
- Shows immediacy's internal contradictions
- Moves to perception through necessity

### Heidegger's Innovation
- Treats immediacy as philosophical problem
- Introduces "absolvent" framework from start
- Emphasizes being-question in immediacy
- Views movement as ontological rather than merely dialectical

## 2. Role of "We" (Observers)

### Hegel's Text
- "We" observe natural consciousness (ยง109)
- Witnesses dialectical movement
- Records experience's results
- Maintains scientific standpoint

### Heidegger's Reinterpretation
- "We" are already in absolute knowledge
- Must reconstruct immediacy
- Participates in absolvent movement
- Connected to fundamental ontology

## 3. Treatment of Language

### Hegel's Account
- Language expresses universal (ยง97)
- "Divine nature" reverses meaning (ยง110)
- Shows impossibility of pure particularity
- Tool of dialectical movement

### Heidegger's Reading
- Language reveals being
- Connection to logos tradition
- Fundamental to spirit's self-showing
- Not just dialectical but ontological

## 4. Structure of Experience

### Hegel's Presentation
- Movement through contradictions
- Natural progression to universal
- Necessary development
- Educational journey

### Heidegger's Framework
- Experience as absolvent movement
- Return to original unity
- Question of being central
- Historical-ontological significance

## 5. Critical Points of Divergence

1. **Metaphysical Framework**
   - Hegel: Focus on dialectical necessity
   - Heidegger: Focus on being-question

2. **Historical Understanding**
   - Hegel: Development of consciousness

3. **Methodological Approach**

## 6. Evaluation

### Strengths of Heidegger's Reading
1. Reveals deeper ontological dimension
2. Connects to broader philosophical tradition
3. Opens new interpretive possibilities

### Questions Raised
1. Does being-question impose external framework?
2. Is absolvent knowledge faithful to Hegel's method?
3. What is lost in ontological emphasis?

## 7. Implications

1. For Reading Phenomenology
   - New attention to ontological dimensions
   - Question of method's nature
   - Role of reconstruction

2. For Understanding Hegel
   - Relationship to tradition
   - Nature of absolute knowing
