## 1. Phenomenology Notes (§95-96)

### A. Two-Column Format
```
CONSCIOUSNESS CLAIMS         | OUR OBSERVATIONS
--------------------------------|--------------------------------
*"Now is Night"              | Initial immediate claim
                            | - Takes form of simple assertion
                            | - Claims direct knowledge
                            | - Assumes pure immediacy

†Writing test proposed       | We initiate test of immediacy
                            | - External preservation
                            | - Time as test medium
                            | - Truth claim fixed

*"Now is Day"               | Contradiction emerges
                            | - Previous truth false
                            | - Yet Now remains
                            | - Structure persists

‡Universal emerges          | Learning through negation
                            | - Now survives content
                            | - Universal through particular
                            | - Truth in form not content
```

### B. Movement Tracking
```
Initial Position → Test → Contradiction → Learning
(Night)          (Write) (Day)          (Universal)

Key Moments:
* - Initial claims
† - Testing points
‡ - Learning moments
```

### C. Analysis Notes
```
1. Structure Observed:
   - Claim → Test → Failure → Truth
   - Particular → Universal
   - Immediate → Mediated

2. Method Elements:
   - Experience central
   - Testing necessary
   - Learning through failure

3. Systematic Points:
   - First shape of consciousness
   - Movement to perception prepared
   - Truth through experience
```

## 2. Logic Notes (Pure Being)

### A. Main Text with Margins
```
MAIN TEXT                    | MARGIN NOTES
--------------------------------|--------------------------------
"Being, pure being..."         | → Initial determination
                              | - Complete abstraction
                              | - Pure immediacy

"without determination..."     | ⇒ Internal structure
                              | - Pure indeterminacy
                              | - Self-identity empty

"is in fact nothing..."       | ⇔ Necessary development
                              | - Identity through emptiness
                              | - Movement to nothing
                              | - Becoming emerges

```

### B. Development Tracking
```
Pure Being → Nothing → Becoming
(Empty)    (Same)   (Truth)

Relations:
→ Internal development
⇒ Necessary connection
⇔ Systematic link
```

### C. Analysis Notes
```
1. Thought Structure:
   - Pure determination
   - Internal relations
   - Systematic development

2. Method Elements:
   - Pure thinking
   - Internal necessity
   - Systematic connection

3. Systematic Points:
   - First category
   - Ground of determinacy
   - Basis for development
```

## 3. Integration Notes

### A. Parallel Structure
```
PHENOMENOLOGY               | LOGIC
-------------------------------|--------------------------------
Immediate knowing            | Pure being
Testing/contradiction       | Internal emptiness
Universal emerges           | Becoming as truth

Method Comparison:
- Experience vs. Thought
- External vs. Internal
- Learning vs. Development
```

### B. Key Questions
```
1. Why both necessary?
   - Different aspects
   - Complementary methods
   - Systematic unity

2. How related?
   - Experience → pure thought
   - Natural → scientific
   - Phenomenology → Logic

3. What unified?
   - Truth's emergence
   - Necessity's role
   - System's development
```

### C. Discussion Points
```
1. Method Questions:
   - Why two approaches?
   - How complement?
   - What unified?

2. Content Questions:
   - Immediacy's role?
   - Negation's function?
   - Truth's emergence?

3. System Questions:
   - How connected?
   - Why ordered thus?
   - What achieved?
