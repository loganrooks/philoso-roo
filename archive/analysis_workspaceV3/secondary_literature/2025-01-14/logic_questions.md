Date: March 6, 2025
Target Course Date: January 14, 2025

## 1. On Pure Being

### A. Structural Questions
1. Beginning:
   - How does the Logic's beginning with pure being compare to sense-certainty's beginning with pure immediacy?
   - What makes both these beginnings necessary?
   - Why must thought/experience start here?

2. Movement:
   - How does pure being's transition to nothing compare with the This's self-negation?
   - What makes these movements necessary?
   - Is the logic of negation the same in both cases?

3. Result:
   - How does becoming compare to the universal This?
   - What role does preservation play in each case?
   - How does determinacy emerge?

### B. Methodological Questions
1. On Immediacy:
   - What is the difference between:
     * Phenomenological immediacy (sense-certainty)
     * Logical immediacy (pure being)
     * Their respective mediations

2. On Necessity:
   - What makes the movement necessary in:
     * Consciousness's experience
     * Thought's self-development
     * Their systematic connection

3. On Truth:
   - How does truth emerge through:
     * Phenomenological experience
     * Logical development
     * Their interrelation

## 2. On Being and Nothing

### A. Textual Questions
1. Specific Passages:
   - "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same" (SL)
   Compare with:
   - "The Now that is Night is preserved" (PhS §96)
   
   Ask:
   - How do these passages relate?
   - What role does preservation play?
   - How does identity emerge from difference?

2. Movement Analysis:
   - Track specific steps in:
     * Being → Nothing movement
     * This → Not-this movement
     * Their structural parallels

3. Language Questions:
   - How does language work in:
     * Expressing pure being
     * Saying the This
     * Revealing truth

### B. Ontological Questions
1. Being's Status:
   - What is the relationship between:
     * Being in sense-certainty
     * Being in logic
     * Being as such

2. Negation's Role:
   - How does negation function in:
     * Phenomenological experience
     * Logical development
     * Ontological structure

3. Truth's Nature:
   - How does truth show itself in:
     * Consciousness's movement
     * Thought's development
     * Being's self-manifestation

## 3. Systematic Connections

### A. Development Questions
1. On Progress:
   - How does development work in:
     * Consciousness's journey
     * Logic's unfolding
     * Their intersection

2. On Necessity:
   - What makes transitions necessary in:
     * Phenomenological experience
     * Logical movement
     * Systematic structure

3. On Integration:
   - How do these texts:
     * Support each other
     * Differ from each other
     * Complete each other

### B. Critical Questions
1. On Method:
   - Is the method same or different in:
     * Phenomenology
     * Logic
     * Their relation

2. On Truth:
   - What is the relationship between:
     * Phenomenological truth
     * Logical truth
     * Absolute truth

3. On System:
   - How do these moments fit into:
     * The development of consciousness
     * The system of logic
     * Philosophy as a whole
