### B. Movement Structure
1. Traditional View
   - Dialectical necessity
   - Progressive development
   - Educational journey

2. Heidegger's Revision
   - Absolvent movement
   - Return to origins
   - Being-historical significance

## 2. Key Chapter Transitions

### A. Sense-Certainty to Perception
- Traditional: Necessary dialectical movement

   - Truth as event

## 4. Reading Strategies

### A. For Individual Chapters
1. Look for ontological dimensions

   - In educational aspects?
   - In systematic coherence?
