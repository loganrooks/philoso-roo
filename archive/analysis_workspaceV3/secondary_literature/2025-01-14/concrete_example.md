# Concrete Analysis Example: Sense-Certainty §95-97
Date: March 6, 2025
Target Course Date: January 14, 2025

## 1. First Reading: Dialectical Structure

### A. Opening Position (§95)
Key Quote: "What is the This? If we take the 'This' in the twofold shape of its being, as 'Now' and as 'Here'"

Structure:
1. Question posed about "This"
2. Division into Now/Here
3. Setup for dialectical examination

### B. Dialectical Movement (§95-96)
1. Initial Claim: "Now is Night"
   - Appears as immediate truth
   - Written down for testing
   - Preserved for examination

2. First Negation:
   - Later observation: statement becomes false
   - "Now is Day" contradicts previous truth
   - Shows instability of immediate claim

3. Key Transformation:
   - Now preserves itself through negation
   - Remains Now despite content changes
   - Emerges as "permanent and self-preserving"

4. Result:
   - Now revealed as universal
   - Contains/survives particular moments
   - "Neither This nor That"

### C. Language Movement (§97)
1. Initial Attempt:
   - Try to say particular This
   - Attempt to express immediate
   - Want to capture pure singular

2. Linguistic Reality:
   - Actually say universal
   - "This", "is" are universal terms
   - Language reveals truth

3. Resolution:
   - Language more truthful than intention
   - Universal emerges as truth
   - Particularity impossible to express

## 2. Heidegger's Questions Applied

### A. Being Analysis
1. Role of "is":
   - In "Now is Night"
   - In universal being
   - In truth claims

2. Presence/Absence:
   - Now's presence through absence
   - Being's persistence
   - Truth's manifestation

3. Temporal Structure:
   - Now's self-preservation
   - Time's role in truth
   - Historical dimension

### B. Language Analysis
1. Saying and Showing:
   - What language reveals
   - How truth emerges
   - Role of manifestation

2. Truth as Unconcealment:
   - Language's "divine nature"
   - Truth's self-showing
   - Being's disclosure

## 3. Integration Points

### A. Key Connections
1. Dialectical/Ontological:
   - Movement shows being's structure
   - Negation reveals presence
   - Universal emerges through being

2. Language/Truth:
   - Language's ontological role
   - Truth's self-manifestation
   - Being's linguistic nature

### B. Specific Questions
1. For Discussion:
   - How does being persist through change?
   - What makes language "more truthful"?
   - Why is universal necessary?

2. For Further Analysis:
   - Connection to Logic's beginning
   - Role of time in truth
   - Nature of philosophical language

## 4. Note-Taking Example

### Column 1: Text Analysis
```
§95: "What is the This?"

- Division into Now/Here
- Setup for movement

§96: "The Now that is Night"
- Initial position
- Preservation attempt
- Transformation shown

§97: "Language more truthful"
- Universal emerges
- Particular impossible
- Truth revealed
```

### Column 2: Ontological Questions
```
Being:
- Role of "is"
- Presence/absence
- Temporal structure

Language:
- Saying/showing
- Truth's emergence
- Being's disclosure
```

### Column 3: Integration
```
Questions:
- How does being persist?
- Why is language truthful?
- What makes universal necessary?

Connections:
- To Logic
- To method
- To system
```

## 5. Key Terms to Track
1. Being-Terms:
   - is/are
   - presence
   - truth

2. Temporal Terms:
   - Now
   - preservation
   - persistence

3. Language Terms:
   - say/speak
   - mean/intend
   - express

## 6. Discussion Questions
1. Textual:
   - How exactly does the Now preserve itself?
   - What makes language "more truthful"?
   - Why can't we express the particular?

2. Philosophical:
   - What is the relationship between being and time?
   - How does truth show itself?
   - What makes universality necessary?
