# Concrete Reading Strategies for Hegel After Heidegger
Date: March 6, 2025
Target Course Date: January 14, 2025

## 1. Specific Reading Protocols

### A. For Phenomenology Sections
1. First Reading - Dialectical Structure
   - Identify opening position explicitly (e.g., in sense-certainty: immediate knowing)
   - Track key terms and their transformations (e.g., "this", "now", "here")
   - Note each moment where the position breaks down (e.g., when universality emerges)
   - Map the specific steps of the dialectical movement

2. Second Reading - Heidegger's Questions
   - Locate references to being and its forms (e.g., "is", "being", presence)
   - Identify passages about language and truth
   - Note moments where method becomes explicit
   - Mark references to history and time

3. Integration Reading
   - Compare dialectical and ontological aspects
   - Note where they align/conflict
   - Track methodological questions

### B. Concrete Example: Sense-Certainty to Perception
1. In Sense-Certainty:
   - Map the specific breakdown of the "this"
   - Track how universality emerges from particularity
   - Note role of language in this emergence
   - Consider ontological significance

2. Transition Point:
   - Identify exact moment of transition
   - Note how perception becomes necessary
   - Consider both dialectical and ontological necessity

3. In Perception:
   - Track how prior problems reappear
   - Note new forms of universality
   - Consider historical significance

## 2. Specific Discussion Questions

### A. For Textual Analysis
1. Concrete Examples:
   - "How exactly does the 'this' break down in ยง95?"
   - "What specific role does language play in ยง97?"
   - "How does universality emerge in ยง96?"

2. Methodological Questions:
   - "What makes this movement necessary?"
   - "How does this specific transition work?"
   - "What counts as experience here?"

### B. For Integration
1. Specific Connections:
   - Between sections (e.g., how does sense-certainty's universality relate to perception?)
   - Between texts (e.g., how does this relate to Science of Logic's beginning?)
   - Between interpretations (e.g., what does Heidegger's reading reveal/obscure?)

## 3. Concrete Writing Practices

### A. Note-Taking Format
1. First Column: Textual Analysis
   - Direct quotes
   - Term tracking
   - Movement mapping

2. Second Column: Heidegger's Questions
   - Ontological significance
   - Historical connections
   - Methodological issues

3. Third Column: Integration
   - Connections to other texts
   - Questions raised
   - Problems identified

### B. Specific Focus Points
1. For Sense-Certainty:
   - Track every use of "is"
   - Map each transformation of "this"
   - Note each moment of mediation

2. For Perception:
   - Track thing/property relation
   - Note forms of universality
   - Map deception/truth relation

## 4. Weekly Practice

### A. Pre-Reading (1 hour)
1. Review previous section's conclusions
2. Identify key terms to track
3. Note expected connections

### B. First Reading (2 hours)
1. Map dialectical movement
2. Track key terms
3. Note problems

### C. Second Reading (2 hours)
1. Apply Heidegger's questions
2. Consider ontological dimensions
3. Note historical connections

### D. Integration (1 hour)
1. Compare readings
2. Generate questions
3. Prepare discussion points

## 5. Specific Evaluation Criteria

### A. For Understanding
1. Can you:
   - Map the dialectical movement precisely?
   - Identify ontological questions?
   - Connect to broader themes?

2. Have you:
   - Tracked key terms?
   - Noted methodological issues?
   - Connected to other texts?

### B. For Discussion
1. Can you:
   - Provide textual evidence?
   - Explain transitions?
   - Raise substantive questions?
