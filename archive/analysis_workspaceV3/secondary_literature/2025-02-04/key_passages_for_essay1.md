# Key Passages for Essay 1: Why Hegel Claims Both That Being Is Nothing and Being Is Not Nothing

## Introduction

This document collects and analyzes key passages from Robert Pippin's "Realm of Shadows" and Martin Heidegger's "Negativity: A Confrontation with Hegel" that are most relevant for writing an essay on why Hegel claims both that Being is Nothing and Being is not Nothing. These passages provide scholarly context and interpretive frameworks that can help develop a sophisticated response to the essay prompt.

## Key Passages from Pippin

### 1. On Hegel's Project in the Science of Logic

> "The Science of Logic is the science of pure thinking. Pure thinking's object is itself, what it is to be thinking (where this must also include, at an a priori level, what it is for thought to have objects at all), and is pure in the sense that it is not aided by empirical experience."

**Relevance**: This passage helps situate Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing within his larger project of developing a science of pure thinking. It clarifies that the Logic is not about empirical objects but about the conditions of possibility for any determinate thought.

### 2. On the Beginning with Being

> "We begin with an attempt to assume nothing about determinacy and determinations. The idea is to begin with the thought of anything at all, in its immediate indeterminacy, simply being, Sein. But the thought of anything at all in its immediate indeterminacy is not the thought of anything; the object of such thought is nothing, Nichts."

**Relevance**: This passage directly addresses why Being is the appropriate starting point and how it immediately leads to Nothing. It explains that the attempt to think pure, indeterminate being fails because there is nothing determinate to think, and this failure itself reveals that Being is Nothing.

### 3. On What We're Talking About When We Talk About 'Being' and 'Nothing'

> "The forms of thought studied by philosophy are the forms without which a thing could not be intelligible as what it is (where what it is is a determinate something). We study the intelligibility of what there is by studying judgmental, essentially predicative form."

**Relevance**: This passage helps clarify that what's at stake in the Logic is not entities or things but concepts and the conditions of conceptual determination. It addresses the question of what we're talking about when we talk about 'Being' and 'Nothing'.

### 4. On the Identity and Difference of Being and Nothing

> "The attempted thought of immediate indeterminacy has a different content than the thought that the content of such a determination is nothing. It is a failed thought, not the thought of this failure or even just the enactment of the failure."

**Relevance**: This passage explains why Being and Nothing must be both identical and different. They are identical in their complete indeterminacy, but they are different in that Being is the attempt to think pure indeterminacy, while Nothing is the recognition of the failure of this attempt.

### 5. On the Role of Contradiction in the Logic

> "The one thing needed to achieve scientific progress—and it is essential to make an effort at gaining this quite simple insight into it—is the recognition of the logical principle that negation is equally positive, or that what is self-contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into abstract nothingness, but essentially only into the negation of its particular content..."

**Relevance**: This passage explains the role of the contradiction between Being and Nothing in the larger project of the Logic. It shows that this contradiction is not a logical error but the first instance of the dialectical movement that drives the entire Logic forward.

### 6. On the Apperceptive Character of Judgment

> "The apperceptive character of judging is what accounts for this characterization of the judging act itself as having the status of something inherently 'negative' as well as positive."

**Relevance**: This passage connects the identity and difference of Being and Nothing to the apperceptive character of judgment. It suggests that the contradiction between Being and Nothing reflects the self-conscious nature of thought itself.

### 7. On Mediated Immediacy

> "Immediacy of knowledge is so far from excluding mediation, that the two things are linked together—immediate knowledge being actually the product and result of mediated knowledge."

**Relevance**: This passage helps explain the paradoxical notion of "mediated immediacy" that is central to Hegel's account of Becoming, the first concrete category of the Logic. It shows how the contradiction between Being and Nothing is resolved in Becoming.

## Key Passages from Heidegger

### 1. On the Questionlessness of Being and Nothing

> "Hegel's 'nothing': the first true thing, i.e., the first 'being' in the broader sense, is becoming; it is the difference of being and nothing as the difference that is none. The nothing is not distinct from being and is not an other to it, but rather the same."

**Relevance**: This passage provides Heidegger's perspective on why Being and Nothing are identical. It emphasizes that their identity stems from their shared indeterminacy, but this indeterminacy itself points to a deeper issue - the unquestioned presuppositions of Western metaphysics.

### 2. On Hegel's Concept of Being

> "In contrast, that which Hegel designates with 'being' we call 'objectness,' which is a designation that indeed captures what Hegel himself also means. Why Hegel calls 'objectness' 'being' is, again, not arbitrary."

**Relevance**: This passage helps clarify that Hegel's concept of Being is not the same as the traditional metaphysical concept of Being as the most general category of what exists. It provides a critical perspective on Hegel's starting point.

### 3. On the Ontological Difference

> "This renunciation of the all-grounding difference expresses itself in Hegel's claim that the distinction between being and nothing is none. But this grounding difference is what in Being and Time we called 'ontological difference.'"

**Relevance**: This passage introduces Heidegger's concept of the "ontological difference" between being and beings, which he argues is presupposed but not questioned in Hegel's system. It provides a deeper perspective on why Being must be Nothing.

### 4. On the A-byss and the Nothing

> "The a-byss: the nothing, what is most a-byssal—beyng itself; not because the latter is what is most empty and general, and what fades the most, the last fumes—but the richest, the singular, the middle that does not mediate and thus can never be taken back."

**Relevance**: This passage offers Heidegger's alternative understanding of the Nothing as the "a-byss" (Ab-grund) of Being itself, not merely its logical negation. It provides a deeper perspective on the relationship between Being and Nothing.

### 5. On the Clearing and the A-byss

> "The clearing is the a-byss as ground, the nihilating counterpart to all that is [das Nichtende zu allem Seienden] and thus the heaviest thing. It is thus the 'ground' that is never 'present-at-hand' and that is never found, the 'ground' that refuses itself in the nihilation as clearing—the supporting-founding one that decides, the one that e-vents—the e-vent."

**Relevance**: This passage introduces Heidegger's concept of the "clearing" (Lichtung) in which beings can appear as beings. It offers a deeper understanding of the relationship between Being and Nothing that goes beyond Hegel's logical treatment.

### 6. On Beyng and Nothing

> "Beyng 'is' the 'nothing,'—not because each is equally as undetermined and unmediated as the other, but because they are one and yet 'fundamentally' different! They are that which first opens up a 'decision.'"

**Relevance**: This passage offers Heidegger's perspective on why Being and Nothing are both identical and different. It emphasizes that their identity is not based on their shared indeterminacy but on their essential belonging-together.

### 7. On Hegel's Negativity

> "Hegel's negativity is not a negativity because it never takes seriously the not and the nihilating,—it has already sublated the not into the 'yes.'"

**Relevance**: This passage offers Heidegger's critique of Hegel's treatment of negativity. It argues that Hegel's dialectic ultimately subordinates negativity to positivity, which prevents him from thinking the Nothing in its own right.

### 8. On the Renunciation of the Ontological Difference

> "That which conditions here is the complete re-nunciation of the grounding of the difference between being and beings."

**Relevance**: This passage argues that Hegel's system depends on a "renunciation" of the fundamental difference between being and beings. It provides a critical perspective on the presuppositions of Hegel's Logic.

## Integrating Pippin and Heidegger

### 1. On the Beginning with Being

**Pippin**: "We begin with an attempt to assume nothing about determinacy and determinations. The idea is to begin with the thought of anything at all, in its immediate indeterminacy, simply being, Sein."

**Heidegger**: "Being conceived of as indeterminacy and immediacy."

**Integration**: Both Pippin and Heidegger emphasize that Hegel begins with Being as pure indeterminacy. However, they differ in their assessment of this beginning. For Pippin, it is the most minimal starting point possible for a science of pure thinking. For Heidegger, it reflects a specific interpretation of Being that is characteristic of Western metaphysics.

### 2. On the Identity of Being and Nothing

**Pippin**: "The thought of anything at all in its immediate indeterminacy is not the thought of anything; the object of such thought is nothing, Nichts."

**Heidegger**: "The nothing is not distinct from being and is not an other to it, but rather the same."

**Integration**: Both Pippin and Heidegger agree that Being and Nothing are identical in their complete indeterminacy. However, they differ in their explanation of this identity. For Pippin, it stems from the failure of the attempt to think pure indeterminacy. For Heidegger, it reflects the "questionlessness" of Being and Nothing in Western metaphysics.

### 3. On the Difference Between Being and Nothing

**Pippin**: "The attempted thought of immediate indeterminacy has a different content than the thought that the content of such a determination is nothing. It is a failed thought, not the thought of this failure or even just the enactment of the failure."

**Heidegger**: "Beyng 'is' the 'nothing,'—not because each is equally as undetermined and unmediated as the other, but because they are one and yet 'fundamentally' different! They are that which first opens up a 'decision.'"

**Integration**: Both Pippin and Heidegger acknowledge that Being and Nothing must be different despite their identity. However, they differ in their explanation of this difference. For Pippin, it stems from the distinction between the attempt to think pure indeterminacy and the recognition of the failure of this attempt. For Heidegger, it reflects the essential belonging-together of Being and Nothing as that which "first opens up a 'decision.'"

### 4. On the Role of Contradiction in the Logic

**Pippin**: "What is self-contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into abstract nothingness, but essentially only into the negation of its particular content."

**Heidegger**: "Hegel's negativity is not a negativity because it never takes seriously the not and the nihilating,—it has already sublated the not into the 'yes.'"

**Integration**: Both Pippin and Heidegger recognize the importance of contradiction in Hegel's Logic. However, they differ in their assessment of its role. For Pippin, it is the engine of conceptual development that drives the Logic forward. For Heidegger, it reflects Hegel's subordination of negativity to positivity, which prevents him from thinking the Nothing in its own right.

## Conclusion

These key passages from Pippin and Heidegger provide complementary perspectives on why Hegel claims both that Being is Nothing and Being is not Nothing. Pippin offers a sophisticated account of the logical movement from Being to Nothing that emphasizes the apperceptive character of judgment and the discursive nature of thought. Heidegger provides a critical perspective that situates Hegel's claims within the broader context of Western metaphysics and introduces alternative concepts like the "ontological difference," the "a-byss," and the "clearing" that offer a deeper understanding of the relationship between Being and Nothing.

By integrating these perspectives, we can develop a nuanced approach to the essay question that addresses all the required components while maintaining fidelity to Hegel's text. This approach would emphasize that Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing are not metaphysical assertions about entities but reflections on the conditions of possibility for any determinate thinking, while also acknowledging the deeper questions about the relationship between Being and Nothing that Hegel's Logic raises but does not fully address.
