## Overview

This analysis integrates insights from Heidegger and Pippin to provide a comprehensive understanding of Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing at the beginning of the Science of Logic. By examining these two different but complementary interpretations, we can develop a nuanced approach to the essay question that addresses all the required components while maintaining fidelity to Hegel's text.

## Key Sections from Pippin for Essay 1

### 1. Hegel's Project in the Science of Logic

Pippin provides a clear account of Hegel's project that can help address the first part of the essay prompt:

> "The Science of Logic is the science of pure thinking. Pure thinking's object is itself, what it is to be thinking (where this must also include, at an a priori level, what it is for thought to have objects at all), and is pure in the sense that it is not aided by empirical experience."

For Pippin, the Logic is a post-Kantian development of transcendental philosophy that investigates the conditions of possibility for any determinate thinking. The "rules" it obeys include:

- It must be presuppositionless in the sense that it cannot rely on empirical experience or pre-given conceptual frameworks
- It can only rely on what emerges from the immanent development of thought itself
- It must be self-determining, not guided by external criteria

However, as Pippin notes, Hegel does acknowledge certain minimal presuppositions:

> "But if no presupposition is to be made, if the beginning is itself to be taken immediately, then the only determination of this beginning is that it is to be the beginning of logic, of thought as such. There is only present [vorhanden] the resolve [Entschluß], which can also be viewed as arbitrary [Willkühr], of considering [betrachten] thinking as such."

This passage is crucial for addressing why Hegel is entitled to begin with Being - it is the most minimal presupposition possible for a science of pure thinking.

### 2. The Beginning with Being

On why Hegel begins with Being, Pippin offers this explanation:

> "We begin with an attempt to assume nothing about determinacy and determinations. The idea is to begin with the thought of anything at all, in its immediate indeterminacy, simply being, Sein. But the thought of anything at all in its immediate indeterminacy is not the thought of anything; the object of such thought is nothing, Nichts."

This passage directly addresses why Being is the appropriate starting point and how it immediately leads to Nothing. For Pippin, this is not a strange metaphysical claim but a reflection on the conditions of thinking itself.

### 3. What We're Talking About: Concepts, Not Entities

Pippin is clear that what's at stake in the Logic is not entities or things but concepts and the conditions of conceptual determination:

> "The forms of thought studied by philosophy are the forms without which a thing could not be intelligible as what it is (where what it is is a determinate something). We study the intelligibility of what there is by studying judgmental, essentially predicative form."

This helps address the question of what we're talking about when we talk about 'Being' and 'Nothing' - we're talking about concepts, not entities or things.

### 4. The Identity and Difference of Being and Nothing

Pippin explains the identity of Being and Nothing in terms of the failure of the attempt to think pure, indeterminate being:

> "The attempted thought of immediate indeterminacy has a different content than the thought that the content of such a determination is nothing. It is a failed thought, not the thought of this failure or even just the enactment of the failure."

But he also explains why they must be different:

> "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same. The truth is neither being nor nothing, but rather that being has passed over into nothing and nothing into being—'has passed over' [übergegangen], not passes over [übergeht]. But the truth is just as much that they are not without distinction; it is rather that they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable, and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite."

This passage directly addresses why Being is Nothing and why Being is not Nothing, making it essential for the essay.

### 5. The Role of Contradiction in the Logic

Pippin explains the role of this contradiction in the larger project of the Logic:

> "The one thing needed to achieve scientific progress—and it is essential to make an effort at gaining this quite simple insight into it—is the recognition of the logical principle that negation is equally positive, or that what is self-contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into abstract nothingness, but essentially only into the negation of its particular content..."

This contradiction between Being and Nothing is the first instance of the dialectical movement that drives the entire Logic forward, leading to the concept of Becoming as the first concrete category.

## Key Sections from Heidegger for Essay 1

### 1. The Questionlessness of Being and Nothing

Heidegger's analysis of the "questionlessness" of Being and Nothing provides a different perspective that can enrich the essay:

> "Hegel's 'nothing': the first true thing, i.e., the first 'being' in the broader sense, is becoming; it is the difference of being and nothing as the difference that is none. The nothing is not distinct from being and is not an other to it, but rather the same."

For Heidegger, the identity of Being and Nothing stems from their shared indeterminacy, but this indeterminacy itself points to a deeper issue - the unquestioned presuppositions of Western metaphysics.

### 2. Being and Nothing as Moments of Becoming

Heidegger emphasizes that Being and Nothing are moments of Becoming, not separate entities:

> "The nothing and the question: Why are there beings rather than nothing? The metaphysical character of the question, grounded in the primacy of beings."

This perspective helps explain why Being and Nothing must be both identical and different - they are moments of a single process, Becoming, which is the first true category of the Logic.

### 3. The Ontological Difference

Heidegger's concept of the "ontological difference" between being and beings provides a deeper perspective on why Being must be Nothing:

> "This renunciation of the all-grounding difference expresses itself in Hegel's claim that the distinction between being and nothing is none. But this grounding difference is what in Being and Time we called 'ontological difference.'"

For Heidegger, Hegel's identification of Being and Nothing is a consequence of the "renunciation" of the fundamental difference between being and beings, which allows for the unconditioned thinking of absolute idealism.

## Integrated Approach to Essay 1

### 1. Hegel's Project and Its Rules

An integrated approach would emphasize that Hegel's Science of Logic is an attempt to develop a science of pure thinking that investigates the conditions of possibility for any determinate thought. The "rules" it obeys include:

- It must begin without presuppositions about the content of thought
- It can only rely on what emerges from the immanent development of thought itself
- It must be self-determining, not guided by external criteria

However, as both Pippin and Heidegger acknowledge, there is a minimal presupposition: the "resolve" to consider thinking as such. This resolve is not a substantial presupposition but the condition for the Logic to begin at all.

### 2. Why Begin with Being?

Being is the appropriate starting point because it is the most minimal, indeterminate concept possible - the thought of anything at all in its immediate indeterminacy. As Pippin explains, this is not a metaphysical claim about some entity called "Being" but a reflection on the conditions of thinking itself.

Heidegger adds that this beginning with Being is also a reflection on the history of Western metaphysics, which has always begun with the question of Being (from Parmenides onward).

### 3. What Are We Talking About?

When we talk about 'Being' and 'Nothing' in the Logic, we are talking about concepts or thought-determinations (Denkbestimmungen), not entities or things. These concepts are the conditions of possibility for any determinate thinking, not objects of empirical experience.

As Pippin emphasizes, the Logic studies "the forms without which a thing could not be intelligible as what it is." Heidegger adds that these concepts are also moments in the history of Western metaphysics, reflecting its fundamental presuppositions.

### 4. What Being and Nothing Are

Being is the thought of anything at all in its immediate indeterminacy - the most minimal concept possible. It is pure, indeterminate immediacy without any further determination.

Nothing is the absence of all determination - not a separate entity or concept, but the same indeterminacy viewed from a different perspective. As Heidegger puts it, "The nothing is not distinct from being and is not an other to it, but rather the same."

### 5. How Hegel Gets from Being to Nothing

Hegel "gets from" Being to Nothing through the failure of the attempt to think pure, indeterminate being. As Pippin explains, "the thought of anything at all in its immediate indeterminacy is not the thought of anything; the object of such thought is nothing."

This is not a temporal process or a deduction, but a reflection on what happens when we try to think pure Being. The attempt fails because there is nothing determinate to think, and this failure itself reveals that Being is Nothing.

### 6. Why Being Is and Is Not Nothing

Being is Nothing because both are completely indeterminate - there is no content to distinguish them. As pure indeterminacy, Being lacks any determination that would differentiate it from Nothing.

But Being is also not Nothing because they are different moments or perspectives on indeterminacy. As Hegel puts it, "they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable, and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite."

This contradiction is not a logical error but the first instance of the dialectical movement that drives the entire Logic forward. It reveals that pure indeterminacy is unstable and must give way to determination.

### 7. The Role of Contradiction in the Logic

The contradiction between Being and Nothing plays a crucial role in the larger project of the Logic. It is the first instance of the dialectical movement that drives the development of all the categories.

As Pippin explains, "what is self-contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into abstract nothingness, but essentially only into the negation of its particular content." In this case, the contradiction between Being and Nothing resolves itself into Becoming, the first concrete category of the Logic.

This pattern of contradiction and resolution continues throughout the Logic, driving the development of increasingly adequate categories until we reach the Absolute Idea.

## Key Quotations from Hegel's Science of Logic

To support this interpretation, the essay should include key quotations from Hegel's text:

1. On the beginning with Being:
   "Being, pure being – without further determination." (p. 59)

2. On the identity of Being and Nothing:
   "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same." (p. 59)

3. On the difference between Being and Nothing:
   "But the truth is just as much that they are not without distinction; it is rather that they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable, and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite." (p. 60)

4. On Becoming as the resolution:
   "Their truth is therefore this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming, a movement in which the two are distinguished, but by a distinction which has just as immediately dissolved itself." (p. 60)

5. On the role of contradiction:
   "Something is therefore alive only insofar as it contains contradiction within itself, and is that force which can both comprehend and endure contradiction." (p. 439)

## Conclusion

By integrating insights from both Heidegger and Pippin, we can develop a nuanced approach to the essay question that addresses all the required components while maintaining fidelity to Hegel's text. This approach emphasizes that Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing are not metaphysical assertions about entities but reflections on the conditions of possibility for any determinate thinking.

The contradiction between Being and Nothing is not a logical error but the first instance of the dialectical movement that drives the entire Logic forward. It reveals that pure indeterminacy is unstable and must give way to determination, setting the pattern for the development of all the categories that follow.

This integrated analysis provides a solid foundation for addressing the essay prompt in a way that is both philosophically rigorous and accessible to readers unfamiliar with Hegel's thought.
