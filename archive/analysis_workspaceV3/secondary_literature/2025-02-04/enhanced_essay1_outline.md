# Enhanced Essay Outline: Why Hegel Claims Both That Being Is Nothing and Being Is Not Nothing

## Introduction
- Introduce the paradoxical claim in Hegel's Science of Logic that Being is Nothing and Being is not Nothing
- Briefly situate this claim within Hegel's larger project in the Science of Logic
- Acknowledge the difficulty of understanding this apparent contradiction without falling into "Hegel-ese"
- Thesis statement: Hegel's seemingly contradictory claims about Being and Nothing are not logical errors but the first instance of the dialectical movement that drives his entire logical system, revealing that pure indeterminacy is unstable and must give way to determination

## I. Hegel's Project in the Science of Logic and Its Rules

### A. The Science of Logic as a science of pure thinking
- Logic investigates the conditions of possibility for any determinate thought
- Logic is not merely formal but also metaphysical - it studies "the forms without which a thing could not be intelligible as what it is"
- Key quotation from Pippin: "The Science of Logic is the science of pure thinking. Pure thinking's object is itself, what it is to be thinking (where this must also include, at an a priori level, what it is for thought to have objects at all), and is pure in the sense that it is not aided by empirical experience."
- Heidegger's insight: "The Logic's subject matter, what it is trying to make sense of, are the modalities of sense-makings" - this helps clarify that Hegel is not engaged in a merely subjective analysis but in an investigation of the conditions of intelligibility itself

### B. The rules Hegel's Logic obeys
- Must begin without substantial presuppositions about the content of thought
- Can only rely on what emerges from the immanent development of thought itself
- Must be self-determining, not guided by external criteria
- Key quotation from Hegel: "But if no presupposition is to be made, if the beginning is itself to be taken immediately, then the only determination of this beginning is that it is to be the beginning of logic, of thought as such. There is only present the resolve, which can also be viewed as arbitrary, of considering thinking as such." (SL 21.56)
- Heidegger's clarification: This "resolve" is not a psychological state but the essential ground for the possibility of the Logic - "There is only present [vorhanden] the resolve [Entschluß], which can also be viewed as arbitrary [Willkühr], of considering [betrachten] thinking as such" (21.56)

### C. The historical significance of Hegel's Logic (Heidegger's perspective)
- Hegel's Logic stands as "the singular and not yet comprehended demand for a confrontation with it" in the history of thinking
- The Logic represents the culmination of Western metaphysics
- Heidegger: "Nietzsche, who freed himself very slowly and rather late from the pathetic slander and disregard for Hegel that he inherited from Schopenhauer, once said that 'we Germans are Hegelians, even if there had never been a Hegel.'" (SecondaryLit/Heidegger_Hegel/Heidegger_Hegel01_NegativityNothingAbyssBeing.md)

## II. Why Hegel Begins with Being

### A. Being as the most minimal starting point
- Being is the most minimal, indeterminate concept possible - the thought of anything at all
- This starting point follows from the requirement of presuppositionlessness
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Being, pure being – without further determination." (SL 59)
- Heidegger's insight: "Being conceived of as indeterminacy and immediacy" - this helps clarify that Being is not a thing but a thought-determination

### B. The historical context of beginning with Being
- Connection to Parmenides and the beginning of Western metaphysics
- Hegel's response to the Parmenidean problem of how to think not-being
- Key quotation from Pippin: "We begin in effect at the beginning of philosophy, with 'Father Parmenides' and so with the beginning of Western rationalism."
- Heidegger's elaboration: "Parmenides reasoned (a good candidate for the first philosophical or metaphysical thought) that all that could be intelligibly thought is 'what there is,' Being, so that is all there could be. Not-being could not be intelligibly thought; it was unintelligible, alogos, and therefore could not be."

### C. The distinction between Hegel's and traditional concepts of Being (Heidegger's critique)
- Heidegger: "In contrast, that which Hegel designates with 'being' we call 'objectness,' which is a designation that indeed captures what Hegel himself also means. Why Hegel calls 'objectness' 'being' is, again, not arbitrary."
- This distinction helps clarify that Hegel's concept of Being is not the same as the traditional metaphysical concept of Being as the most general category of what exists
- Heidegger: "Hegel's concept of being arose from the dis-mantling of absolute actuality—what is most differentiated from it. The outermost externalization!"

## III. What We're Talking About When We Talk About 'Being' and 'Nothing'

### A. Concepts, not entities
- Being and Nothing are concepts or thought-determinations (Denkbestimmungen), not entities
- They are moments in the development of pure thinking, not objects of empirical experience
- Key quotation from Pippin: "The forms of thought studied by philosophy are the forms without which a thing could not be intelligible as what it is."
- Heidegger's clarification: "Being is the immediate [Das Seyn ist das Unmittelbare]" - this helps emphasize that Being is a logical category, not an entity

### B. The apperceptive character of these concepts
- Being and Nothing are moments in the self-determination of thought
- They reflect the apperceptive character of judgment - thought's relation to itself
- Key quotation from Pippin: "The apperceptive character of judging is what accounts for this characterization of the judging act itself as having the status of something inherently 'negative' as well as positive."
- Heidegger's insight: "Thinking 'says' of a being what it is and how it is. Thinking maintains the determinative relation to the being of beings. Thinking thus also and in advance indicates the horizon within which being determines itself as such."

### C. The ontological difference (Heidegger's contribution)
- Heidegger introduces the crucial distinction between being and beings (the "ontological difference")
- This difference is presupposed but not questioned in Hegel's system
- Heidegger: "This renunciation of the all-grounding difference expresses itself in Hegel's claim that the distinction between being and nothing is none. But this grounding difference is what in Being and Time we called 'ontological difference.'"
- This perspective helps clarify why Being must be Nothing - both are on the "being" side of the ontological difference, not on the side of particular beings

## IV. What Being and Nothing Are

### A. Being as pure, indeterminate immediacy
- Being is the thought of anything at all in its immediate indeterminacy
- It lacks any determination that would make it something specific
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Being is the indeterminate immediate." (SL 59)
- Heidegger's elaboration: "Being 'is' also not a being and 'is' never a being; it is therefore the un-determined and un-mediated. Being conceived of as beingness is indeterminacy and immediacy."

### B. Nothing as the absence of all determination
- Nothing is not a separate entity but the same indeterminacy viewed from a different perspective
- It is the absence of all determination, just as Being is
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Nothing, pure nothing: it is simply equality with itself, complete emptiness, absence of all determination and content." (SL 59)
- Heidegger's insight: "The nothing as the a-byss, beyng itself" - this helps clarify that Nothing is not mere absence but has a positive role in the development of thought

### C. The questionlessness of Being and Nothing (Heidegger's critique)
- Heidegger argues that Being and Nothing are "questionless" in Hegel's system
- Their origin and essential structure are not treated as questionworthy
- Heidegger: "Hegel's 'nothing': the first true thing, i.e., the first 'being' in the broader sense, is becoming; it is the difference of being and nothing as the difference that is none. The nothing is not distinct from being and is not an other to it, but rather the same."
- This perspective helps explain why Being and Nothing must be identical yet different - they are moments of a single process, not separate entities

## V. How Hegel 'Gets From' Being to Nothing

### A. The failure of the attempt to think pure Being
- The attempt to think pure, indeterminate Being fails because there is nothing determinate to think
- This failure itself reveals that Being is Nothing
- Key quotation from Pippin: "The thought of anything at all in its immediate indeterminacy is not the thought of anything; the object of such thought is nothing."
- Heidegger's clarification: "The attempted thought of immediate indeterminacy has a different content than the thought that the content of such a determination is nothing. It is a failed thought, not the thought of this failure or even just the enactment of the failure."

### B. Not a temporal or deductive process
- The movement from Being to Nothing is not temporal or deductive
- It is a reflection on what happens when we try to think pure Being
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same." (SL 59)
- Heidegger's insight: "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same. The truth is neither being nor nothing, but rather that being has passed over into nothing and nothing into being—'has passed over' [übergegangen], not passes over [übergeht]."
- This distinction between "has passed over" and "passes over" is crucial - it emphasizes that the movement is not temporal but logical

### C. The role of negation in this movement
- Negation is not merely a logical operation but a constitutive feature of thought
- Heidegger: "Negativity is the differentiatedness that differentiates itself—differentiation that is differentiated within itself—'consciousness.'"
- This helps clarify that the movement from Being to Nothing is not an external negation but an internal self-negation

## VI. Why Being Is Nothing and Why Being Is Not Nothing

### A. Why Being is Nothing
- Both are completely indeterminate - there is no content to distinguish them
- As pure indeterminacy, Being lacks any determination that would differentiate it from Nothing
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same." (SL 59)
- Heidegger's elaboration: "The nothing is not distinct from being and is not an other to it, but rather the same."

### B. Why Being is not Nothing
- They are different moments or perspectives on indeterminacy
- Being is positive indeterminacy, Nothing is negative indeterminacy
- Key quotation from Hegel: "But the truth is just as much that they are not without distinction; it is rather that they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable, and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite." (SL 60)
- Heidegger's insight: "Beyng 'is' the 'nothing,'—not because each is equally as undetermined and unmediated as the other, but because they are one and yet 'fundamentally' different! They are that which first opens up a 'decision.'"
- This helps clarify that the difference between Being and Nothing is not a mere logical distinction but has ontological significance

### C. The unity of identity and difference in Becoming
- The contradiction between Being and Nothing resolves itself into Becoming
- Becoming is the first concrete category of the Logic
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Their truth is therefore this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming, a movement in which the two are distinguished, but by a distinction which has just as immediately dissolved itself." (SL 60)
- Heidegger's elaboration: "As im-permanence—denial of permanence. But thus ambivalent: (a) lack of permanence—mere flow and elapsing. (b) The continual passing-over. (c) Restlessness as permanency (!) of origins."
- This helps clarify that Becoming is not merely a synthesis of Being and Nothing but a complex concept with multiple dimensions

## VII. The Role of This Contradiction in the Larger Project of the Science of Logic

### A. The dialectical movement of the Logic
- The contradiction between Being and Nothing is the first instance of the dialectical movement
- This pattern of contradiction and resolution continues throughout the Logic
- Key quotation from Pippin: "What is self-contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into abstract nothingness, but essentially only into the negation of its particular content."
- Heidegger's insight: "Hegel's negativity is not a negativity because it never takes seriously the not and the nihilating,—it has already sublated the not into the 'yes.'"
- This critique helps clarify that Hegel's dialectic is not merely negative but always already oriented toward positive resolution

### B. The necessity of contradiction for development
- Contradiction is not a logical error but the engine of conceptual development
- It reveals the inadequacy of each category and drives the movement to more adequate ones
- Key quotation from Hegel: "Something is therefore alive only insofar as it contains contradiction within itself, and is that force which can both comprehend and endure contradiction." (SL 439)
- Heidegger's elaboration: "The negative, the lack of that which is lacking, is the moving principle, not the mere away, but the missing—the belonging-also-to-it. The negative is therefore at bottom the self of absolute self-consciousness. The negative is the 'energy' of (absolute) thinking."

### C. The clearing and the abyss (Heidegger's alternative perspective)
- Heidegger offers an alternative understanding of the relationship between Being and Nothing
- The Nothing is the "a-byss" (Ab-grund) of Being itself, not merely its logical negation
- Heidegger: "The clearing is the a-byss as ground, the nihilating counterpart to all that is [das Nichtende zu allem Seienden] and thus the heaviest thing. It is thus the 'ground' that is never 'present-at-hand' and that is never found, the 'ground' that refuses itself in the nihilation as clearing—the supporting-founding one that decides, the one that e-vents—the e-vent."
- This perspective offers a deeper understanding of the relationship between Being and Nothing that goes beyond Hegel's logical treatment

## Conclusion
- Summarize why Hegel claims both that Being is Nothing and Being is not Nothing
- Emphasize that this contradiction is not a logical error but the first instance of the dialectical movement
- Acknowledge Heidegger's critique that Hegel's treatment of negativity ultimately subordinates it to positivity
- Reflect on the significance of this contradiction for understanding Hegel's philosophical method
- Final thought: Hegel's treatment of Being and Nothing reveals that pure indeterminacy is unstable and must give way to determination, setting the pattern for the development of all the categories that follow
