## 1. Key Framework for Class Discussion

### A. Core Technical Terms & Concepts
1. Absolvent Knowledge:

   - Necessity of movement
   Purpose: Provides deeper framework for understanding consciousness's development

2. Being-Question:
   - Role of "is" claims
   - Presence/absence structure
   - Time and truth relation
   Purpose: Shows philosophical depth of seemingly simple claims

### B. Essential Movement Structure
1. Phases:
   - Initial immediacy claim
   - Experience of contradiction
   - Truth's emergence
   Purpose: Clear map for guiding discussion

2. Key Moments:
   - "Now is Night" assertion
   - Writing/testing process
   - Language's revelation
   Purpose: Concrete examples for class engagement

## 2. Discussion Development Strategy

### A. Opening Sequence
1. Start with Text:
   ```
   "What is the This?" (§95)
   → Consciousness's claim
   → Our observation

   ```
   Purpose: Ground discussion in concrete passage

2. Develop Through:
   ```
   Language role
   → Being claims
   → Time structure
   → Truth emergence
   ```
   Purpose: Build philosophical depth systematically

### B. Critical Transitions
1. From Claim to Test:
   ```
   Immediate assertion
   → Need for verification
   → Writing experiment
   ```
   Purpose: Show necessity of movement

2. From Test to Truth:
   ```
   Temporal difference
   → Language's role
   → Universal emergence
   ```
   Purpose: Reveal philosophical significance

## 3. Key Passages for Discussion

### A. Primary Texts
1. §95-96 (This/Now):
   - Initial claim
   - Testing process
   - Result emergence
   Purpose: Core movement example

2. §97 (Language):
   - Universal revelation
   - Truth emergence
   - Systematic significance
   Purpose: Philosophical culmination

### B. Supporting Analysis
1. Heidegger's Insights:
   - Being structure
   - Language role
   - Truth nature
   Purpose: Deepen discussion

2. Systematic Connections:
   - To introduction
   - To later chapters
   - To whole project
   Purpose: Show broader significance

## 4. Student Engagement Strategy

### A. Question Sequence
1. Opening Questions:
   - What does consciousness claim?
   - How does it test this?
   - What does it learn?
   Purpose: Start with accessible points

2. Deeper Inquiry:
   - Why must language reveal universal?
   - How does time show truth?
   - What makes this necessary?
   Purpose: Build philosophical depth

### B. Discussion Development
1. From Text to Philosophy:
   ```
   Specific claims
   → General structure
   → Philosophical significance
   ```
   Purpose: Guide thinking process

2. Through Key Moments:
   ```
   Experience structure
   → Language role
   → Truth emergence
   ```
   Purpose: Show development

## 5. Integration Points
