## Reading Analysis

### Detailed Section Analysis
#### A. Introduction (§90-91)
- §90: Sets up sense-certainty's initial claim to immediate knowledge
  * Claims to be most immediate form of knowledge
  * Appears to require no conceptual mediation
  * Takes object "as it simply is"

- §91: Introduces key dialectical tension
  * Initially appears as richest knowledge (infinite examples)
  * Actually proves to be poorest truth (mere "is")
  * First example of determinate negation in action

#### B. Structure of Sense-Certainty (§92-94)
- §92: Reveals initial mediation
  * Splits into two 'Thises': I and object
  * Each mediated through the other
  * Undermines pure immediacy claim

- §93-94: Analysis of truth criterion
  * Object posited as essence
  * 'I' as unessential/mediated
  * Sets up investigation of object's truth

#### C. Analysis of 'Now' (§95-97)
- §95: The dialectic of 'Now'
  * Initial claim: "Now is night"
  * Testing through time
  * Truth becomes stale

- §96-97: Emergence of universality
  * Now preserves itself through change
  * Becomes indifferent to content
  * Reveals itself as universal

#### D. Analysis of 'Here' (§98)
- Parallel structure to 'Now'
  * "Here is a tree" becomes "Here is a house"
  * Here persists through change
  * Shows spatial universality

#### E. Pure Being and Meaning (§99-100)
- §99: Analysis of pure being
  * Not immediate but mediated
  * Negation essential to it
  * Universal abstraction

- §100: Shift to meaning [Meinen]
  * Truth moves to subjective side
  * "My" object becomes focus
  * New stage of investigation

#### F. Analysis of 'I' (§101-102)
- Universality of self-consciousness
  * Every 'I' is universal
  * Parallel to Here/Now
  * Language reveals truth

#### G. Final Movement (§103-110)
- §103-104: Attempt at pure immediacy
  * Whole of sense-certainty as essence
  * Excluding all mediation
  * Final attempt fails

- §105-108: Analysis of pointing
  * Cannot capture pure particular
  * Movement generates universality
  * Time essential to demonstration

- §109-110: Philosophical conclusions
  * Eleusinian mysteries reference
  * Critique of private language
  * Truth of universality
