# Technical Reading Strategy: Sense-Certainty
Date: March 6, 2025
Focus: How to Read Given Technical Terms

## 1. Initial Approach to Text

### A. What NOT to Do
1. Common Mistakes:
   - Starting with everyday meanings
   - Importing philosophical definitions
   - Assuming familiar patterns

2. Why Problematic:
   Quote (§90):
   ```
   "The knowledge or knowing which is at the start... must be immediate"
   ```
   Shows: Must start without presuppositions

### B. What to Do Instead
1. Technical Reading:
   - Follow actual operations
   - Let terms define themselves
   - Track internal movement

2. Evidence Needed:
   - Textual operations
   - Internal necessity
   - Movement patterns

## 2. Specific Reading Protocols

### A. For Movement Terms
1. When Reading "Movement":
   Example §107:
   ```
   "In this pointing-out, then, we see merely a movement..."
   ```

   Track:
   - NOT succession of events
   - BUT internal development
   - Through actual operation

2. Verification Steps:
   - Find complete movement
   - Show internal necessity
   - Demonstrate unity

### B. For Language Terms
1. When Reading "Language":
   Example §97:
   ```
   "language, as we see, is the more truthful"
   ```

   Track:
   - NOT communication tool
   - BUT truth's operation
   - In actual saying

2. Verification Steps:
   - Show actual operation
   - Track transformation
   - Note necessity

## 3. Technical Reading Process

### A. First Reading
1. Initial Steps:
   - Mark technical terms
   - Note their operations
   - Track connections

2. Evidence Required:
   - Actual text passages
   - Operational details
   - Movement patterns

### B. Second Reading
1. Follow Operations:
   - Through whole sections
   - In unified movements
   - With internal necessity

2. Verify Through:
   - Textual evidence
   - Operation patterns
   - Necessary connections

## 4. Specific Section Protocols

### A. For §90-94 (Opening)
1. Track Terms:
   - "Immediate"
   - "Knowledge"
   - "Object"

2. Through Operations:
   - Initial claims
   - Internal divisions
   - Necessary development

### B. For §95-99 (Now/Here)
1. Track Terms:
   - "Now"
   - "Here"
   - "Movement"

2. Through Operations:
   - Actual pointing
   - Internal necessity
   - Truth emergence

### C. For §100-110 (Conclusion)
1. Track Terms:
   - "Language"
   - "Universal"
   - "Truth"

2. Through Operations:
   - Final movement
   - Complete necessity
   - System connection

## 5. Verification Procedures

### A. For Terms
1. Must Show:
   - Actual operation
   - Internal necessity
   - Unified movement

2. Through:
   - Textual evidence
   - Operation patterns
   - Complete development

### B. For Movement
1. Must Demonstrate:
   - Internal necessity
   - Complete operation
   - Truth emergence

2. Through:
   - Step-by-step analysis
   - Pattern recognition
   - Unity verification

## 6. Integration Steps

### A. Within Text
1. Connect Operations:
   - Between sections
   - Through movements
   - In necessity

2. Show Unity:
   - Of development
   - Through operation
   - In truth

### B. With System
1. Note Connections:
   - To Introduction
   - To later chapters
   - To whole

2. Through:
   - Operational patterns
   - Necessary development
   - Systematic unity
