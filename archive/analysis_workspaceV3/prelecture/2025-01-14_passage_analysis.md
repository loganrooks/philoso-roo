# Detailed Passage Analysis: ยง107-108
Date: March 6, 2025
Focus: Technical Terms in Operation

## 1. The Full Passage

### A. Core Text (ยง107)
```
"In this pointing-out, then, we see merely a movement which takes the following course: (1) I point out the 'Now', and it is asserted to be the truth. I point it out, however, as something that has been, or as something that has been superseded; I set aside the first truth. (2) I now assert as the second truth that it has been, that it is superseded. (3) But what has been, is not; I set aside the second truth, its having been, its supersession, and thereby negate the negation of the 'Now', and thus return to the first assertion, that the 'Now' is."
```

### B. Continuation (ยง108)
```
"The Here pointed out, to which I hold fast, is similarly a this Here which, in fact, is not this Here, but a Before and Behind, an Above and Below, a Right and Left... The Here, which was supposed to have been pointed out, vanishes in other Heres, but these likewise vanish."
```

## 2. Movement's Technical Operation

### A. Three-Step Structure
1. First Step (Pointing):
   - NOT: mere physical gesture
   - BUT: attempt at immediate truth
   - Through: actual operation of pointing

2. Second Step (Supersession):
   - NOT: temporal passing
   - BUT: internal negation
   - Through: operation itself

3. Third Step (Return):
   - NOT: circular repetition
   - BUT: transformation through negation
   - Through: operation's completion

### B. Evidence of Technical Sense
Quote:
```
"this first, thus reflected into itself, is not exactly the same as it was to begin with"
```

Shows:
1. Movement AS:
   - Self-reflection
   - Through determinations
   - In one operation

## 3. Necessity's Operation

### A. In Pointing's Failure
Quote:
```
"The Here pointed out... in fact, is not this Here"
```

Technical Analysis:
1. Necessity Shows As:
   - NOT: external constraint
   - BUT: internal impossibility
   - Through: actual attempt

2. Evidenced By:
   - Failure from within
   - Through own operation
   - Not external limitation

### B. In Spatial Structure
Quote:
```
"but a Before and Behind, an Above and Below, a Right and Left"
```

Shows Necessity As:
1. Internal Differentiation:
   - NOT: subjective perspective
   - BUT: spatial truth itself
   - Through: actual determination

## 4. Language's Technical Role

### A. In Expression
Quote:
```
"I point out the 'Now', and it is asserted to be the truth"
```

Technical Operation:
1. Language Functions:
   - NOT: describing pointing
   - BUT: showing truth
   - Through: actual saying

2. Evidence:
   - Truth emerges in saying
   - Against intention
   - Through operation

### B. In Truth's Emergence
Quote:
```
"what abides is a simple complex of many Heres"
```

Shows Language:
1. Operating Through:
   - Universal emergence
   - In particular attempts
   - As one movement

## 5. Unity of Terms

### A. Movement-Necessity-Language
1. Unified Operation:
   - Movement shows necessity
   - Through language
   - As one process

2. Evidence:
   - Each attempt fails
   - Failure shows truth
   - In one operation

### B. In Truth's Structure
1. Truth Emerges:
   - Through necessary movement
   - In linguistic operation
   - As unified showing

2. Verified By:
   - Actual operation
   - Internal necessity
   - Complete movement

## 6. Reading Implications

### A. For This Passage
1. Must Track:
   - Actual operations
   - Not assumed meanings
   - Through whole movement

2. By Following:
   - Each step's necessity
   - In unified movement
   - Through language

### B. For Whole Text
1. Shows Pattern:
   - Of phenomenological method
   - Through concrete operation
   - In necessary movement

2. Verifies:
   - Technical meanings
   - Through operation
   - In actual text
