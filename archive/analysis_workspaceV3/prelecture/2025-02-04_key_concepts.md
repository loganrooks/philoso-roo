## Introduction

This document provides determinate analyses of the key concepts in the beginning of Hegel's Science of Logic: Being, Nothing, Becoming, and Sublation. Each concept is analyzed through direct textual evidence, positive determination (what it is), negative determination (what it is not), distinction from ordinary usage, and potential misinterpretations.

## 1. Pure Being (reines Sein)

### Direct Textual Evidence

> "Being, pure being – without further determination. In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself and also not unequal with respect to another; it has no difference within it, nor any outwardly." (p. 59)

> "Pure indeterminateness and emptiness. – There is nothing to be intuited in it, if one can speak here of intuiting; or, it is only this pure empty intuiting itself. Just as little is anything to be thought in it, or, it is equally only this empty thinking. Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact nothing, and neither more nor less than nothing." (p. 59)

### Positive Determination

Pure Being is:
- The most abstract, indeterminate concept possible
- Immediate (not mediated by anything else)
- Equal only to itself
- The starting point of the Logic
- Empty intuiting and empty thinking
- The thought of anything at all in its immediate indeterminacy

### Negative Determination

Pure Being is not:
- A determinate entity or thing
- A concept with specific content or qualities
- Different from itself or from anything else (since difference requires determination)
- Mediated by anything else
- Something that can be intuited or thought in the ordinary sense
- A stable concept that can stand on its own (it immediately passes over into Nothing)

### Distinction from Ordinary Usage

In ordinary language, "being" typically refers to:
- Existence (the fact that something is)
- A specific entity or thing that exists
- A property of existing things

In Hegel's Logic, however, Pure Being is:
- Not the existence of any particular thing
- Not a property of existing things
- Not even the general concept of existence as applied to things
- Rather, it is the most abstract, indeterminate thought possible, prior to any specific determination

### Potential Misinterpretations

1. **Misinterpretation**: Pure Being is a thing or entity that exists.
   - Why this is incorrect: Pure Being is not a thing but a thought-determination, the most abstract concept possible. It has no specific content or qualities.
   - Textual evidence against: "There is nothing to be intuited in it... it is only this pure empty intuiting itself."

2. **Misinterpretation**: Pure Being is stable and self-sufficient.
   - Why this is incorrect: Pure Being immediately passes over into Nothing due to its complete indeterminacy.
   - Textual evidence against: "Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact nothing, and neither more nor less than nothing."

3. **Misinterpretation**: Pure Being is different from Nothing.
   - Why this is incorrect: In their complete indeterminacy, Being and Nothing are identical.
   - Textual evidence against: "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same."

### Related Terms Requiring Distinction

- **Determinate Being (Dasein)**: Unlike Pure Being, Determinate Being has specific content and qualities. It is Being with determination, the result of the dialectical movement through Being, Nothing, and Becoming.

- **Existence (Existenz)**: In Hegel's system, Existence appears later in the Logic as a more developed category. It is "the complement of possibility" and involves explicit mediation, whereas Pure Being is immediate and indeterminate.

- **Being-for-itself (Fürsichsein)**: This is a more developed form of Being that has returned to itself from otherness. Unlike Pure Being, it is determinate and self-related.

## 2. Nothing (Nichts)

### Direct Textual Evidence

> "Nothing, pure nothingness; it is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, complete absence of determination and content; lack of all distinction within." (p. 59)

> "In so far as mention can be made here of intuiting and thinking, it makes a difference whether something or nothing is being intuited or thought. To intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning; the two are distinguished and so nothing is (concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather it is the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being." (p. 59)

### Positive Determination

Nothing is:
- Simple equality with itself
- Complete emptiness
- Complete absence of determination and content
- Lack of all distinction within
- The empty intuiting and thinking itself (like Pure Being)
- The thought of the absence of all determination

### Negative Determination

Nothing is not:
- A determinate negation (the negation of something specific)
- The opposite of Being in the ordinary sense
- A concept with specific content or qualities
- Different from itself or from Pure Being (in their complete indeterminacy)
- Something that can be intuited or thought in the ordinary sense
- A stable concept that can stand on its own (it immediately passes over into Being)

### Distinction from Ordinary Usage

In ordinary language, "nothing" typically refers to:
- The absence of something specific
- The negation of something determinate
- A lack or void

In Hegel's Logic, however, Pure Nothing is:
- Not the absence of any particular thing
- Not the negation of any determinate content
- Rather, it is the complete absence of all determination, which makes it identical to Pure Being in its indeterminacy

### Potential Misinterpretations

1. **Misinterpretation**: Nothing is simply the absence or negation of Being.
   - Why this is incorrect: Nothing is not the opposite of Being but identical to it in their complete indeterminacy.
   - Textual evidence against: "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same."

2. **Misinterpretation**: Nothing is a stable and self-sufficient concept.
   - Why this is incorrect: Nothing immediately passes over into Being due to its complete indeterminacy.
   - Textual evidence against: "Their truth is therefore this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming."

3. **Misinterpretation**: Nothing is a mere nullity without philosophical significance.
   - Why this is incorrect: Nothing is a crucial moment in the dialectical development of the Logic.
   - Textual evidence against: "What is sublated does not thereby turn into nothing. Nothing is the immediate; something sublated is on the contrary something mediated."

### Related Terms Requiring Distinction

- **Determinate Nothing**: This is the negation of something specific, not the pure, indeterminate Nothing that appears at the beginning of the Logic. Hegel notes: "Here, however, the nothing is to be taken in its indeterminate simplicity."

- **Non-being**: Hegel mentions this as an alternative to "nothing" but notes that "there is no objection to this as regards the result, since in non-being there is contained the reference to being."

- **Negation**: This is a more developed form of negativity that appears later in the Logic. Unlike pure Nothing, negation is always the negation of something specific.

## 3. Becoming (Werden)

### Direct Textual Evidence

> "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same. The truth is neither being nor nothing, but rather that being has passed over into nothing and nothing into being – 'has passed over,' not passes over. But the truth is just as much that they are not without distinction; it is rather that they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable, and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite. Their truth is therefore this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming, a movement in which the two are distinguished, but by a distinction which has just as immediately dissolved itself." (pp. 59-60)

> "Becoming is in this way doubly determined. In one determination, nothing is the immediate, that is, the determination begins with nothing and this refers to being; that is to say, it passes over into it. In the other determination, being is the immediate, that is, the determination begins with being and this passes over into nothing – coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be." (p. 60)

### Positive Determination

Becoming is:
- The unity of Being and Nothing
- The movement of the immediate vanishing of Being into Nothing and Nothing into Being
- Doubly determined as coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be
- The first concrete category of the Logic
- The truth of Being and Nothing
- A movement in which Being and Nothing are distinguished but by a distinction that immediately dissolves itself

### Negative Determination

Becoming is not:
- A third concept alongside Being and Nothing
- A temporal process (Hegel emphasizes "has passed over," not "passes over")
- A stable, fixed category (it resolves itself into Determinate Being)
- The mere combination or mixture of Being and Nothing
- Something that can be intuited or thought in isolation from Being and Nothing
- A concept that can be adequately grasped by formal logic

### Distinction from Ordinary Usage

In ordinary language, "becoming" typically refers to:
- A temporal process of change
- The transition from one state to another
- Development or evolution over time

In Hegel's Logic, however, Becoming is:
- Not a temporal process but a logical movement
- Not the transition between two determinate states but the unity of the most indeterminate concepts (Being and Nothing)
- The first concrete category that has actual content, unlike the empty abstractions of Being and Nothing

### Potential Misinterpretations

1. **Misinterpretation**: Becoming is a temporal process.
   - Why this is incorrect: Becoming in the Logic is not temporal but logical. Hegel emphasizes "has passed over," not "passes over."
   - Textual evidence against: "The truth is neither being nor nothing, but rather that being has passed over into nothing and nothing into being – 'has passed over,' not passes over."

2. **Misinterpretation**: Becoming is a third concept alongside Being and Nothing.
   - Why this is incorrect: Becoming is not a separate concept but the truth of Being and Nothing, their unity in movement.
   - Textual evidence against: "Their truth is therefore this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming."

3. **Misinterpretation**: Becoming is stable and self-sufficient.
   - Why this is incorrect: Becoming resolves itself into Determinate Being due to its internal contradiction.
   - Textual evidence against: "This becoming equally collects itself in quiescent unity. Being and nothing are in it only as vanishing."

### Related Terms Requiring Distinction

- **Coming-to-be (Entstehen)**: This is one moment of Becoming, where Nothing passes over into Being. It is not separate from Becoming but one of its determinations.

- **Ceasing-to-be (Vergehen)**: This is the other moment of Becoming, where Being passes over into Nothing. Like coming-to-be, it is not separate from Becoming but one of its determinations.

- **Change (Veränderung)**: This appears later in the Logic as a more developed form of movement. Unlike Becoming, which involves the most abstract categories, change involves determinate qualities.

## 4. Sublation (Aufheben)

### Direct Textual Evidence

> "To sublate and being sublated (the idealized) constitute one of the most important concepts of philosophy. It is a fundamental determination that repeatedly occurs everywhere in it, the meaning of which must be grasped with precision and especially distinguished from nothing. – What is sublated does not thereby turn into nothing. Nothing is the immediate; something sublated is on the contrary something mediated; it is something non-existent but as a result that has proceeded from a being; it still has in itself, therefore, the determinateness from which it derives." (p. 81)

> "The German 'aufheben' ('to sublate' in English) has a twofold meaning in the language: it equally means 'to keep,' 'to 'preserve',' and 'to cause to cease,' 'to put an end to.' Even 'to preserve' already includes a negative note, namely that something, in order to be retained, is removed from its immediacy and hence from an existence which is open to external influences." (p. 81)

### Positive Determination

Sublation is:
- A fundamental philosophical concept with a twofold meaning: preservation and negation
- The process by which a concept is both preserved and negated in a higher concept
- A form of mediation that results in something non-existent but as a result that has proceeded from a being
- The mechanism for the dialectical movement of the Logic
- A process that retains the determinateness of what is sublated

### Negative Determination

Sublation is not:
- Simple negation or elimination
- Mere preservation without transformation
- A process that results in nothing
- An external operation performed on concepts
- A process that can be adequately grasped by formal logic
- Something that can be reduced to either of its moments (preservation or negation) in isolation

### Distinction from Ordinary Usage

In ordinary language, terms like "cancel," "abolish," or "preserve" typically refer to:
- Eliminating something entirely
- Keeping something unchanged
- Separate operations that cannot occur simultaneously

In Hegel's Logic, however, Sublation is:
- Not mere elimination but a process that preserves while negating
- Not mere preservation but a transformation that negates while preserving
- A single operation that simultaneously preserves and negates
- A process that results in a higher, more concrete concept

### Potential Misinterpretations

1. **Misinterpretation**: Sublation is simply negation or elimination.
   - Why this is incorrect: Sublation involves both negation and preservation, not just negation.
   - Textual evidence against: "The German 'aufheben' ('to sublate' in English) has a twofold meaning in the language: it equally means 'to keep,' 'to 'preserve',' and 'to cause to cease,' 'to put an end to.'"

2. **Misinterpretation**: Sublation is simply preservation without transformation.
   - Why this is incorrect: Sublation involves both preservation and negation, not just preservation.
   - Textual evidence against: "Even 'to preserve' already includes a negative note, namely that something, in order to be retained, is removed from its immediacy."

3. **Misinterpretation**: Sublation results in nothing.
   - Why this is incorrect: What is sublated does not turn into nothing but becomes something mediated.
   - Textual evidence against: "What is sublated does not thereby turn into nothing. Nothing is the immediate; something sublated is on the contrary something mediated."

### Related Terms Requiring Distinction

- **Negation (Negation)**: This is one moment of sublation, but sublation is not reducible to negation. Negation alone would result in nothing, whereas sublation results in a higher, more concrete concept.

- **Preservation (Aufbewahrung)**: This is the other moment of sublation, but sublation is not reducible to preservation. Preservation alone would not involve transformation, whereas sublation transforms what is preserved.

- **Mediation (Vermittlung)**: This is closely related to sublation but is a broader concept. All sublation involves mediation, but not all mediation involves sublation in the full sense of both preservation and negation.

## 5. Determinate Being (Dasein)

### Direct Textual Evidence

> "Becoming, as transition into the unity of being and nothing, a unity which is as existent or has the shape of the one-sided immediate unity of these moments, is existence [Dasein]." (p. 83)

> "The more precise sense and precise expression that being and nothing receive now that they are moments will have to transpire from the consideration of existence, the unity in which they are preserved. Being is being, and nothing is nothing, only as held distinct from each other; in their truth, however, in their unity, they have vanished as such determinations and are now something else. Being and nothing are the same and, precisely because they are the same, they no longer are being and nothing but possess a different determination; in becoming they were coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be; in existence, which is another determinate unity, they are again moments but differently determined." (p. 82)

### Positive Determination

Determinate Being is:
- The unity of Being and Nothing that has become "quiescent simplicity"
- The result of Becoming
- The first category that actually exists
- A one-sided immediate unity of Being and Nothing
- Being with determination
- The first concrete category that has specific content

### Negative Determination

Determinate Being is not:
- Pure Being or Pure Nothing
- Becoming (which is the movement or transition)
- A mere combination or mixture of Being and Nothing
- A category without determination or content
- The final or most adequate category of the Logic
- Something that can be adequately grasped by formal logic

### Distinction from Ordinary Usage

In ordinary language, "existence" typically refers to:
- The fact that something is
- The presence or reality of something
- Being in the world

In Hegel's Logic, however, Determinate Being is:
- Not just the fact that something is
- Not the existence of any particular thing
- The first category that has determination and content
- The result of the dialectical movement through Being, Nothing, and Becoming

### Potential Misinterpretations

1. **Misinterpretation**: Determinate Being is simply existence in the ordinary sense.
   - Why this is incorrect: Determinate Being is a specific logical category with a precise place in the dialectical development of the Logic.
   - Textual evidence against: "The more precise sense and precise expression that being and nothing receive now that they are moments will have to transpire from the consideration of existence, the unity in which they are preserved."

2. **Misinterpretation**: Determinate Being is separate from Being and Nothing.
   - Why this is incorrect: Determinate Being is the unity of Being and Nothing, not something separate from them.
   - Textual evidence against: "Being and nothing are the same and, precisely because they are the same, they no longer are being and nothing but possess a different determination."

3. **Misinterpretation**: Determinate Being is the final or most adequate category of the Logic.
   - Why this is incorrect: Determinate Being is just the beginning of the development of more concrete categories.
   - Textual evidence against: "This unity now remains their base from which they no longer surface in the abstract meaning of being and nothing."

### Related Terms Requiring Distinction

- **Existence (Existenz)**: This appears later in the Logic as a more developed category. Unlike Determinate Being, which is immediate, Existence involves explicit mediation.

- **Reality (Realität)**: This is a more developed form of Determinate Being that appears later in the Logic. It involves specific qualities and determinations.

- **Being-for-itself (Fürsichsein)**: This is a more developed form of Being that has returned to itself from otherness. Unlike Determinate Being, it is explicitly self-related.
