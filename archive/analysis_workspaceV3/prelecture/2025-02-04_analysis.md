- **Title:** Science of Logic
- **Assigned Sections:** pp. 59-82 (The Doctrine of Being: Being, Nothing, Becoming, and Determinate Being)

## 1. Introduction: The Beginning of the Logic

Hegel's Science of Logic begins with what appears to be the most minimal, abstract concept possible: pure Being. This beginning is not arbitrary but follows from the requirement that the Logic must be presuppositionless. As Hegel states in his introduction to the Logic (not included in our reading but referenced in the secondary literature), the beginning must be absolute, without any determinations or mediations. Pure Being fulfills this requirement as it is "without further determination" (p. 59).

The beginning with Being raises several questions that will guide our analysis:
1. Why does Hegel begin with Being?
2. How does Being relate to Nothing?
3. What is the nature of the "movement" from Being to Nothing to Becoming?
4. What is the significance of this first triad for the rest of the Logic?

## 2. Analysis of Key Concepts

### 2.1 Pure Being (reines Sein)

#### 2.1.1 Textual Evidence

Hegel defines Being in the following way:

> "Being, pure being – without further determination. In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself and also not unequal with respect to another; it has no difference within it, nor any outwardly." (p. 59)

He further characterizes it as:

> "Pure indeterminateness and emptiness. – There is nothing to be intuited in it, if one can speak here of intuiting; or, it is only this pure empty intuiting itself. Just as little is anything to be thought in it, or, it is equally only this empty thinking. Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact nothing, and neither more nor less than nothing." (p. 59)

#### 2.1.2 Analysis

Pure Being is characterized by:
- **Indeterminacy**: It has no determinations, no specific qualities or properties
- **Immediacy**: It is not mediated by anything else, it is simply there
- **Self-equality**: It is equal only to itself
- **Lack of difference**: It has no internal differences or external relations
- **Emptiness**: There is nothing to be intuited or thought in it

The key insight here is that Being, in its pure indeterminacy, is "in fact nothing." This is not a casual remark but the central claim that drives the dialectical movement of the Logic. Being, when taken in its purity without any determinations, turns out to be indistinguishable from Nothing.

As Pippin explains, "The thought of anything at all in its immediate indeterminacy is not the thought of anything; the object of such thought is nothing." The attempt to think pure, indeterminate Being fails because there is nothing determinate to think, and this failure itself reveals that Being is Nothing.

Heidegger adds another dimension to this understanding by suggesting that "Being conceived of as indeterminacy and immediacy" is not a thing but a thought-determination. For Heidegger, Hegel's concept of Being arose from the "dis-mantling of absolute actuality" and is not the same as the traditional metaphysical concept of Being as the most general category of what exists.

### 2.2 Nothing (Nichts)

#### 2.2.1 Textual Evidence

Hegel defines Nothing as:

> "Nothing, pure nothingness; it is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, complete absence of determination and content; lack of all distinction within." (p. 59)

He also notes:

> "In so far as mention can be made here of intuiting and thinking, it makes a difference whether something or nothing is being intuited or thought. To intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning; the two are distinguished and so nothing is (concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather it is the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being." (p. 59)

#### 2.2.2 Analysis

Nothing is characterized by:
- **Simple equality with itself**: Like Being, it is self-identical
- **Complete emptiness**: It has no content
- **Absence of determination**: It has no specific qualities
- **Lack of distinction**: It has no internal differences

The key insight is that Nothing, just like Being, is "the empty intuiting and thinking itself." This parallel structure in the definitions of Being and Nothing already suggests their identity. Both are characterized by complete indeterminacy and emptiness.

However, Hegel also notes that there is a difference between intuiting or thinking something and intuiting or thinking nothing. This suggests that while Being and Nothing are identical in their indeterminacy, they are not without distinction.

Heidegger's insight that "The nothing is not distinct from being and is not an other to it, but rather the same" aligns with Hegel's claim about their identity. However, Heidegger adds that they are "one and yet 'fundamentally' different" - they are that which "first opens up a 'decision.'" This suggests that the distinction between Being and Nothing, while not a distinction of content (since both are contentless), is a distinction of perspective or orientation.

Pippin similarly suggests that Being and Nothing are identical in their complete indeterminacy, but they are different in that Being is the attempt to think pure indeterminacy, while Nothing is the recognition of the failure of this attempt.

### 2.3 Becoming (Werden)

#### 2.3.1 Textual Evidence

Hegel defines Becoming as:

> "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same. The truth is neither being nor nothing, but rather that being has passed over into nothing and nothing into being – 'has passed over,' not passes over. But the truth is just as much that they are not without distinction; it is rather that they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable, and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite. Their truth is therefore this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming, a movement in which the two are distinguished, but by a distinction which has just as immediately dissolved itself." (pp. 59-60)

He further elaborates:

> "Becoming is in this way doubly determined. In one determination, nothing is the immediate, that is, the determination begins with nothing and this refers to being; that is to say, it passes over into it. In the other determination, being is the immediate, that is, the determination begins with being and this passes over into nothing – coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be." (p. 60)

#### 2.3.2 Analysis

Becoming is characterized by:
- **Unity of Being and Nothing**: It is the truth of both Being and Nothing
- **Movement**: It is the "immediate vanishing of the one into the other"
- **Double determination**: It contains both coming-to-be (Nothing passing over into Being) and ceasing-to-be (Being passing over into Nothing)
- **Distinction that dissolves itself**: The distinction between Being and Nothing is maintained but also immediately dissolved

The key insight is that Becoming is the first concrete category of the Logic. Unlike Being and Nothing, which are completely indeterminate and empty, Becoming has content - it is the movement or transition between Being and Nothing. This movement is not temporal (Hegel emphasizes "has passed over," not "passes over") but logical.

Hegel's emphasis on the double determination of Becoming is significant. Becoming is not simply the transition from Being to Nothing or from Nothing to Being, but both at once. This double movement creates a kind of oscillation or "unrest" that is characteristic of Becoming.

Pippin notes that this first contradiction between Being and Nothing is the first instance of the dialectical movement that drives the entire Logic forward. "What is self-contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into abstract nothingness, but essentially only into the negation of its particular content." In this case, the contradiction between Being and Nothing resolves itself into Becoming.

Heidegger characterizes Becoming as "im-permanence" with three aspects: "lack of permanence" (mere flow and elapsing), "continual passing-over," and "restlessness as permanency of origins." This captures the dynamic, unstable nature of Becoming as the unity of Being and Nothing.

### 2.4 Sublation (Aufheben) and Determinate Being (Dasein)

#### 2.4.1 Textual Evidence

Hegel explains the concept of sublation:

> "To sublate and being sublated (the idealized) constitute one of the most important concepts of philosophy. It is a fundamental determination that repeatedly occurs everywhere in it, the meaning of which must be grasped with precision and especially distinguished from nothing. – What is sublated does not thereby turn into nothing. Nothing is the immediate; something sublated is on the contrary something mediated; it is something non-existent but as a result that has proceeded from a being; it still has in itself, therefore, the determinateness from which it derives." (p. 81)

He further notes the double meaning of the term:

> "The German 'aufheben' ('to sublate' in English) has a twofold meaning in the language: it equally means 'to keep,' 'to 'preserve',' and 'to cause to cease,' 'to put an end to.' Even 'to preserve' already includes a negative note, namely that something, in order to be retained, is removed from its immediacy and hence from an existence which is open to external influences." (p. 81)

Regarding Determinate Being, Hegel states:

> "Becoming, as transition into the unity of being and nothing, a unity which is as existent or has the shape of the one-sided immediate unity of these moments, is existence [Dasein]." (p. 83)

#### 2.4.2 Analysis

Sublation (Aufheben) is characterized by:
- **Double meaning**: Both preservation and negation
- **Mediation**: What is sublated is mediated, not immediate
- **Result**: It is a result that has proceeded from a being
- **Retention of determinateness**: It still has the determinateness from which it derives

Determinate Being (Dasein) is characterized by:
- **Unity of Being and Nothing**: It is the result of Becoming
- **Existence**: It is the first category that actually exists
- **One-sided immediate unity**: It has the shape of a one-sided immediate unity of Being and Nothing

The key insight is that Becoming, as the restless unity of Being and Nothing, resolves itself into Determinate Being. This resolution occurs through sublation, which both preserves and negates the moments of Being and Nothing. In Determinate Being, Being and Nothing are no longer separate moments but are unified in a stable, existent form.

Pippin notes that this pattern of contradiction and resolution continues throughout the Logic, driving the development of increasingly adequate categories until we reach the Absolute Idea. The first triad of Being-Nothing-Becoming sets the pattern for this development.

Heidegger's concept of the "clearing" (Lichtung) as "the a-byss as ground, the nihilating counterpart to all that is" offers a different perspective on this movement. For Heidegger, the relationship between Being and Nothing is not merely logical but ontological - it concerns the very possibility of the appearance of beings.

## 3. Key Passages and Their Significance

### 3.1 The Identity of Being and Nothing

> "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same." (p. 59)

This simple statement is the core of Hegel's argument. It asserts the identity of Being and Nothing, not as a casual observation but as a philosophical claim with profound implications. This identity is not based on any external comparison but follows from the very nature of Being and Nothing themselves - both are completely indeterminate and empty.

The significance of this claim is that it challenges the common-sense view that Being and Nothing are absolute opposites. By showing their identity, Hegel undermines the rigid either/or thinking of traditional logic and introduces a more fluid, dialectical approach.

### 3.2 The Distinction Between Being and Nothing

> "But the truth is just as much that they are not without distinction; it is rather that they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable, and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite." (p. 60)

This passage complicates the simple identity of Being and Nothing by introducing their distinction. Being and Nothing are not merely identical; they are also "absolutely distinct." This distinction, however, is not a stable one - it "immediately dissolves itself" as each vanishes into its opposite.

The significance of this claim is that it introduces the dynamic element that will drive the entire Logic. The contradiction between the identity and difference of Being and Nothing creates an instability that resolves itself in Becoming.

### 3.3 The Truth of Being and Nothing in Becoming

> "Their truth is therefore this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming, a movement in which the two are distinguished, but by a distinction which has just as immediately dissolved itself." (p. 60)

This passage introduces Becoming as the "truth" of Being and Nothing. Becoming is not a third concept alongside Being and Nothing but their truth - the reality of what they are when considered in their relationship to each other.

The significance of this claim is that it shows how contradiction leads not to nonsense but to a higher, more concrete concept. Becoming is more concrete than either Being or Nothing because it contains both while also expressing their relationship.

### 3.4 The Double Determination of Becoming

> "Becoming is in this way doubly determined. In one determination, nothing is the immediate, that is, the determination begins with nothing and this refers to being; that is to say, it passes over into it. In the other determination, being is the immediate, that is, the determination begins with being and this passes over into nothing – coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be." (p. 60)

This passage elaborates on the structure of Becoming as containing two opposed movements: coming-to-be (Nothing passing over into Being) and ceasing-to-be (Being passing over into Nothing).

The significance of this claim is that it shows the internal complexity of Becoming. Becoming is not a simple concept but contains within itself an opposition that mirrors the opposition between Being and Nothing. This internal opposition will eventually lead to the resolution of Becoming into Determinate Being.

### 3.5 The Concept of Sublation

> "To sublate and being sublated (the idealized) constitute one of the most important concepts of philosophy. It is a fundamental determination that repeatedly occurs everywhere in it, the meaning of which must be grasped with precision and especially distinguished from nothing." (p. 81)

This passage introduces the concept of sublation (Aufheben), which Hegel identifies as "one of the most important concepts of philosophy." Sublation is the process by which a concept is both preserved and negated in a higher concept.

The significance of this claim is that it provides the mechanism for the entire dialectical movement of the Logic. Each category is sublated into a higher, more concrete category that preserves its truth while negating its limitations.

## 4. Difficult Sections and Interpretive Challenges

### 4.1 The Nature of the "Movement" from Being to Nothing

One of the most challenging aspects of Hegel's text is understanding the nature of the "movement" from Being to Nothing. Hegel emphasizes that Being "has passed over" into Nothing, not that it "passes over." This suggests that the movement is not temporal but logical.

Pippin's interpretation helps clarify this point. He suggests that the movement is not a temporal process or a deduction but a reflection on what happens when we try to think pure Being. The attempt fails because there is nothing determinate to think, and this failure itself reveals that Being is Nothing.

Heidegger adds another dimension by suggesting that the distinction between "has passed over" and "passes over" is crucial - it emphasizes that the movement is not temporal but logical. For Heidegger, this movement is not merely logical but ontological - it concerns the very possibility of the appearance of beings.

### 4.2 The Paradox of Beginning

Another difficult section is Hegel's discussion of the paradox of beginning in Remark 3. He notes that if Being is completely indeterminate, it seems impossible to derive anything from it. As he puts it, "from that beginning itself – that is, from that beginning itself – and that an advance can only occur by adding something foreign to it from outside" (p. 81).

Pippin's interpretation helps clarify this paradox. He suggests that the beginning with Being is not arbitrary but follows from the requirement of presuppositionlessness. Being is the most minimal concept possible, but its very indeterminacy contains within it the seed of its own negation. The advance from Being to Nothing is not external but follows from the nature of Being itself.

Heidegger's concept of the "ontological difference" between being and beings provides another perspective. For Heidegger, the beginning with Being presupposes this difference, which is "presupposed but not questioned in Hegel's system." This suggests that the beginning is not as presuppositionless as Hegel claims.

### 4.3 The Relationship Between Being, Nothing, and Becoming

A third difficult section is understanding the precise relationship between Being, Nothing, and Becoming. Hegel states that "The truth is neither being nor nothing, but rather that being has passed over into nothing and nothing into being" (p. 59). This suggests that Becoming is not simply a third concept alongside Being and Nothing but their truth.

Pippin's interpretation helps clarify this relationship. He suggests that Becoming is the first concrete category of the Logic because it contains both Being and Nothing while also expressing their relationship. Becoming is more concrete than either Being or Nothing because it has content - it is the movement or transition between them.

Heidegger's characterization of Becoming as "im-permanence" with three aspects provides another perspective. For Heidegger, Becoming is not merely the unity of Being and Nothing but a complex concept with multiple dimensions: "lack of permanence" (mere flow and elapsing), "continual passing-over," and "restlessness as permanency of origins."

## 5. Questions for Lecture

1. **On the Beginning with Being**: Why does Hegel begin with Being rather than with Nothing or with Becoming? Is this beginning truly presuppositionless, or does it already presuppose certain concepts or frameworks?

2. **On the Identity of Being and Nothing**: In what sense are Being and Nothing "the same"? Is this a claim about their content (or lack thereof), or is it a claim about their logical status?

3. **On the Distinction Between Being and Nothing**: If Being and Nothing are "the same," in what sense are they also "absolutely distinct"? What is the nature of this distinction if it is not a distinction of content?

4. **On the Nature of Becoming**: Is Becoming a third concept alongside Being and Nothing, or is it their truth? In what sense is Becoming more concrete than either Being or Nothing?

5. **On the Role of Negation**: What is the role of negation in the movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming? Is negation merely a logical operation, or does it have ontological significance?

6. **On the Significance of the First Triad**: How does the first triad of Being-Nothing-Becoming set the pattern for the rest of the Logic? What does this triad tell us about Hegel's dialectical method?

7. **On the Concept of Sublation**: What is the significance of the concept of sublation (Aufheben) for understanding the dialectical movement of the Logic? How does sublation differ from simple negation?

8. **On the Relationship to Previous Philosophers**: How does Hegel's treatment of Being and Nothing relate to previous philosophical treatments, particularly those of Parmenides and Heraclitus?

## 6. Conceptual Hypotheses

### 6.1 The Dialectical Structure of the Logic

**Hypothesis**: The first triad of Being-Nothing-Becoming establishes the dialectical structure that will govern the entire Logic. Each category will be shown to contain its own negation, leading to a contradiction that is resolved in a higher, more concrete category.

**Supporting Evidence**: 
- The movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming exemplifies this structure.
- Hegel explicitly states that "the one thing needed to achieve scientific progress... is the recognition of the logical principle that negation is equally positive, or that what is self-contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into abstract nothingness, but essentially only into the negation of its particular content" (p. 71).
- The concept of sublation (Aufheben) provides the mechanism for this dialectical movement.

**Confidence Level**: High

### 6.2 The Concrete Nature of Becoming

**Hypothesis**: Becoming is the first concrete category of the Logic because it contains both Being and Nothing while also expressing their relationship. Unlike Being and Nothing, which are completely indeterminate and empty, Becoming has content - it is the movement or transition between them.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Hegel states that "Becoming is in this way doubly determined" (p. 60), indicating its greater complexity compared to Being and Nothing.
- Becoming contains two opposed movements: coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be.
- Becoming resolves itself into Determinate Being, which is the first category that actually exists.

**Confidence Level**: High

### 6.3 The Role of Negation

**Hypothesis**: Negation is not merely a logical operation but has ontological significance. It is the driving force of the dialectical movement of the Logic, transforming each category into its opposite and then into a higher unity.

**Supporting Evidence**:
- The movement from Being to Nothing involves negation - Being, in its complete indeterminacy, negates itself and becomes Nothing.
- Hegel states that "what is self-contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into abstract nothingness, but essentially only into the negation of its particular content" (p. 71).
- The concept of sublation involves negation as one of its moments.

**Confidence Level**: Medium-High

### 6.4 The Presuppositions of the Beginning

**Hypothesis**: Despite Hegel's claim that the beginning with Being is presuppositionless, it actually presupposes certain concepts or frameworks, particularly the distinction between being and beings (what Heidegger calls the "ontological difference").

**Supporting Evidence**:
- Heidegger argues that "This renunciation of the all-grounding difference expresses itself in Hegel's claim that the distinction between being and nothing is none. But this grounding difference is what in Being and Time we called 'ontological difference.'"
- Hegel himself acknowledges that the beginning involves a "resolve" to consider thinking as such.
- The very concept of a "beginning" presupposes a temporal or logical sequence.

**Confidence Level**: Medium

## 7. Integration with Course Themes

### 7.1 The Systematic Nature of Hegel's Philosophy

The analysis of Being, Nothing, and Becoming demonstrates the systematic nature of Hegel's philosophy. Each category is not isolated but is part of a larger whole, connected to other categories through a necessary dialectical movement. This exemplifies Hegel's view that philosophy must be systematic - it must develop its concepts through an immanent, necessary progression rather than through external reflection.

### 7.2 The Role of Negation and Contradiction

The analysis highlights the central role of negation and contradiction in Hegel's philosophy. For Hegel, contradiction is not a sign of failure but the driving force of conceptual development. This challenges traditional logic, which sees contradiction as something to be avoided, and introduces a more dynamic, dialectical approach.

### 7.3 The Relationship Between Logic and Metaphysics

The analysis raises questions about the relationship between logic and metaphysics in Hegel's philosophy. The Logic is not merely a formal study of the rules of thought but an investigation of the categories that structure reality itself. This suggests that for Hegel, logic and metaphysics are inseparable - the forms of thought are also the forms of being.

## 8. Personal Reflections

The beginning of Hegel's Science of Logic is both fascinating and challenging. The movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming seems at first glance to be a mere play with abstractions, but on closer examination, it reveals profound insights about the nature of thought and reality.

What I find most compelling is Hegel's insistence that contradiction is not a sign of failure but the driving force of conceptual development. This challenges the traditional view that contradiction is something to be avoided and introduces a more dynamic, dialectical approach to philosophy.

I also appreciate Hegel's attention to language, particularly his discussion of the term "aufheben" (sublate) with its double meaning of preservation and negation. This suggests that the ambiguities and contradictions in language are not merely flaws to be eliminated but can reveal deeper philosophical truths.

The secondary literature from Pippin and Heidegger has been invaluable in understanding Hegel's text. Pippin's emphasis on the apperceptive character of judgment and the discursive nature of thought helps clarify the logical movement from Being to Nothing. Heidegger's focus on the ontological difference and the questionlessness of Being and Nothing in Western metaphysics provides a critical perspective that deepens our understanding of Hegel's project.

As we continue our study of Hegel's Logic, I look forward to seeing how the patterns established in this first triad develop and transform throughout the rest of the work.
