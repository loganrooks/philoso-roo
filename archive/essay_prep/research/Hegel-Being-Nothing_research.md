## Primary Sources

### Science of Logic: Hegel's Project and Methodology

> "The beginning must be absolute, or what is synonymous here, an abstract beginning; and so it may not presuppose anything, must not be mediated by anything nor have a ground; rather it is to be itself the ground of the entire science." (Science of Logic, p. 48)

**Context**: This passage appears in the section on "With What Must the Beginning of Science Be Made?" It establishes the requirement of presuppositionlessness for the beginning of the Logic.

**Relevance**: This explains why Hegel begins with Being and why he is entitled to make the claims he does about Being and Nothing. It establishes the methodological framework within which these claims must be understood.

> "The beginning is logical in that it is to be made in the element of thought that is free and for itself, in pure knowing. It is mediated because pure knowing is the ultimate, absolute truth of consciousness." (Science of Logic, p. 48)

**Context**: This passage also appears in the section on "With What Must the Beginning of Science Be Made?" It clarifies the nature of the beginning as logical rather than phenomenological.

**Relevance**: This helps explain the ontological status of Being and Nothing as thought-determinations rather than entities or things.

### Science of Logic: Pure Being

> "Being, pure being – without further determination. In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself and also not unequal with respect to another; it has no difference within it, nor any outwardly. If any determination or content were posited in it as distinct, or if it were posited by this determination or content as distinct from an other, it would thereby fail to hold fast in its purity. It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness." (Science of Logic, p. 59)

**Context**: This is the opening passage of the section on "Being" in the Logic. It is the first category that Hegel introduces.

**Relevance**: This defines Pure Being as completely indeterminate and empty, which is crucial for understanding its identity with Nothing.

> "There is nothing to be intuited in it, if one can speak here of intuiting; or, it is only this pure empty intuiting itself. Just as little is anything to be thought in it, or, it is equally only this empty thinking." (Science of Logic, p. 59)

**Context**: This continues the description of Pure Being from the previous passage.

**Relevance**: This emphasizes the emptiness of Pure Being, which is crucial for understanding its identity with Nothing.

### Science of Logic: Nothing

> "Nothing, pure nothingness; it is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, complete absence of determination and content; lack of all distinction within." (Science of Logic, p. 59)

**Context**: This passage immediately follows the description of Pure Being. It is the second category that Hegel introduces.

**Relevance**: This defines Nothing as completely empty and indeterminate, which is crucial for understanding its identity with Being.

> "In so far as mention can be made here of intuiting and thinking, it makes a difference whether something or nothing is being intuited or thought. To intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning; the two are distinguished and so nothing is (concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather it is the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being." (Science of Logic, p. 59)

**Context**: This continues the description of Nothing from the previous passage.

**Relevance**: This begins to explore the relationship between Being and Nothing, suggesting both their distinction and their identity.

### Science of Logic: Identity of Being and Nothing

> "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same." (Science of Logic, p. 59)

**Context**: This statement follows the descriptions of Pure Being and Nothing. It is the first explicit claim about their relationship.

**Relevance**: This directly addresses the first part of the essay question: why Being is Nothing.

> "What the truth is, is neither being nor nothing, but rather that being has passed over into nothing and nothing into being – 'has passed over,' not passes over." (Science of Logic, p. 59)

**Context**: This follows the claim that Being and Nothing are the same. It begins to introduce the concept of Becoming.

**Relevance**: This suggests that the truth of Being and Nothing lies in their movement or transition, not in either one taken in isolation.

### Science of Logic: Difference Between Being and Nothing

> "But the truth is just as much that they are not without distinction; it is rather that they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable, and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite." (Science of Logic, p. 60)

**Context**: This statement immediately follows the claim that Being and Nothing are the same. It introduces the distinction between them.

**Relevance**: This directly addresses the second part of the essay question: why Being is not Nothing.

> "Their truth is therefore this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming, a movement in which the two are distinguished, but by a distinction which has just as immediately dissolved itself." (Science of Logic, p. 60)

**Context**: This follows the discussion of the distinction between Being and Nothing. It introduces Becoming as their truth.

**Relevance**: This explains how the contradiction between the identity and difference of Being and Nothing is resolved in Becoming.

### Science of Logic: Becoming

> "Becoming is in this way doubly determined. In one determination, nothing is the immediate, that is, the determination begins with nothing and this refers to being; that is to say, it passes over into it. In the other determination, being is the immediate, that is, the determination begins with being and this passes over into nothing – coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be." (Science of Logic, p. 60)

**Context**: This passage elaborates on the nature of Becoming as the unity of Being and Nothing.

**Relevance**: This explains the double determination of Becoming as coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be, which reflects the movement between Being and Nothing.

### Science of Logic: Role of Contradiction

> "The one thing needed to achieve scientific progress... is the recognition of the logical principle that negation is equally positive, or that what is self-contradictory does not resolve itself into a nullity, into abstract nothingness, but essentially only into the negation of its particular content." (Science of Logic, p. 71)

**Context**: This passage appears in the "Remark 3: The Isolating of the Abstractions of Being and Nothing" section.

**Relevance**: This explains the productive role of contradiction in Hegel's Logic, which is crucial for understanding why he makes seemingly contradictory claims about Being and Nothing.

### Science of Logic: Sublation

> "To sublate and being sublated (the idealized) constitute one of the most important concepts of philosophy. It is a fundamental determination that repeatedly occurs everywhere in it, the meaning of which must be grasped with precision and especially distinguished from nothing." (Science of Logic, p. 81)

**Context**: This passage appears in the section on "Determinate Being" following the discussion of Being, Nothing, and Becoming.

**Relevance**: This introduces the concept of sublation (Aufheben), which is crucial for understanding how the contradiction between Being and Nothing is preserved and negated in Becoming.

> "The German 'aufheben' ('to sublate' in English) has a twofold meaning in the language: it equally means 'to keep,' 'to 'preserve',' and 'to cause to cease,' 'to put an end to.' Even 'to preserve' already includes a negative note, namely that something, in order to be retained, is removed from its immediacy and hence from an existence which is open to external influences." (Science of Logic, p. 81)

**Context**: This continues the discussion of sublation from the previous passage.

**Relevance**: This explains the twofold meaning of sublation as preservation and negation, which is crucial for understanding how the contradiction between Being and Nothing is resolved in Becoming.

## Secondary Literature

### Pippin's Interpretation

> "Pippin emphasizes the apperceptive character of judgment and the discursive nature of thought. He interprets Hegel's Logic as an investigation of the categories that structure our thinking about reality, not as a metaphysical account of reality itself." (analysis_workspace/secondary_literature/2025-01-14/hegel_heidegger_comparison.md)

**Relevance**: This helps clarify the ontological status of Being and Nothing as thought-determinations rather than entities or things.

> "For Pippin, the identity of Being and Nothing stems from their complete indeterminacy, while their difference lies in their perspective or orientation. Being is the attempt to think pure indeterminacy, Nothing is the recognition of the failure of this attempt." (analysis_workspace/handoff/class_to_essay_prep_feb4_handoff_revised.md)

**Relevance**: This provides a helpful interpretation of the basis for both the identity and difference of Being and Nothing.

### Heidegger's Interpretation

> "Heidegger interprets Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing in light of his own concern with the 'ontological difference' between being and beings. For Heidegger, Hegel's treatment of Being and Nothing reveals the 'questionlessness of Being' in Western metaphysics." (analysis_workspace/secondary_literature/2025-01-14/heidegger_interpretation.md)

**Relevance**: This provides an alternative perspective on Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing, emphasizing their ontological significance.

> "Heidegger claims that 'Beyng "is" the "nothing,"—not because each is equally as undetermined and unmediated as the other, but because they are one and yet "fundamentally" different!'" (SecondaryLit/Heidegger_Hegel/Heidegger_Hegel01_NegativityNothingAbyssBeing.md)

**Relevance**: This emphasizes both the identity and difference of Being and Nothing, which is central to our thesis.

## Integration Notes

The primary and secondary sources provide strong support for our thesis that Hegel's seemingly contradictory claims about Being and Nothing are both justified within his Science of Logic. The key points that emerge from the research are:

1. **Methodological Framework**: Hegel's Logic begins with Being because it is the most abstract, indeterminate concept possible and fulfills the requirement of presuppositionlessness.

2. **Ontological Status**: Being and Nothing are thought-determinations, not entities or things. They are categories that structure both thought and reality.

3. **Identity**: Being and Nothing are identical in their complete indeterminacy and emptiness. Both lack all determination and content, making them indistinguishable in terms of what they contain (or rather, don't contain).

4. **Difference**: Despite this identity, Being and Nothing have different orientations or perspectives. Being is the positive attempt to think pure indeterminacy, while Nothing is the negative recognition of the failure of this attempt.

5. **Dialectical Movement**: The tension between the identity and difference of Being and Nothing creates a dynamic movement that resolves itself in Becoming, which is their truth.

6. **Role in Larger Project**: This first triad establishes the dialectical pattern for the entire Logic and demonstrates how contradiction leads to development rather than to nonsense.

These points will be developed in the essay, with each supported by direct quotations from Hegel's text and insights from secondary literature.

## Evidence Gaps

1. **Need more on the "rules" of the Logic**: While we have some passages on presuppositionlessness, we could use more on immanent development and other methodological principles.

2. **Need more on the ontological status of Being and Nothing**: While we have some insights from Pippin and Heidegger, we could use more direct textual evidence from Hegel on what kind of things Being and Nothing are.

3. **Need more on the role of this contradiction in the larger project**: While we have some passages on the role of contradiction and sublation, we could use more on how this first triad sets the pattern for the rest of the Logic.

## Next Research Steps

1. Review the Science of Logic more thoroughly for additional passages on methodology, the ontological status of Being and Nothing, and the role of this first triad in the larger project.

2. Consult additional secondary literature for insights on these topics.

3. Organize the evidence according to the outline structure to ensure that each section has adequate textual support.
