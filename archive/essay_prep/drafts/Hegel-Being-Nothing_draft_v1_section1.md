# Hegel's Claims About Being and Nothing

## Section 1: The Project of the Science of Logic and Its Rules

To understand Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing, we must first situate them within his broader philosophical project. The *Science of Logic* is not a traditional logic textbook concerned with the formal rules of valid inference. Rather, it is an ambitious attempt to think being in its purity, without presuppositions. As Hegel puts it, logic is "the exposition of God as he is in his eternal essence before the creation of nature and of a finite spirit" (29). This striking characterization reveals that for Hegel, logic is not merely subjective but has an objective status—it deals with the fundamental structure of reality itself.

### The Presuppositionless Beginning

The most distinctive feature of Hegel's Logic is its claim to begin without presuppositions. Hegel writes that "the beginning must be absolute, or what is synonymous here, an abstract beginning; and so it may not presuppose anything, must not be mediated by anything nor have a ground; rather it is to be itself the ground of the entire science" (48). This requirement stems from Hegel's critique of previous philosophical systems, which he saw as resting on unexamined assumptions. To avoid this pitfall, Hegel seeks a beginning that presupposes nothing.

This requirement places significant constraints on what Hegel is entitled to assume at the outset of the Logic. He cannot presuppose:

1. Any empirical content or sensuous intuition
2. Any determinate concept or category
3. Any distinction between subject and object
4. Any method or principle external to the content itself

Instead, Hegel must allow the content to develop through its own immanent dialectic, without introducing external reflections or comparisons. This is what he means when he criticizes the "impatience" that "wants to have before it only the whole in its perfected state" (71). The development must proceed step by step, with each category emerging necessarily from the previous one.

### The Unity of Form and Content

Another crucial aspect of Hegel's Logic is the unity of form and content. Unlike traditional logic, which treats logical forms as separate from their content, Hegel insists that "the necessary forms of thinking, and its specific determinations, are the content and the ultimate truth itself" (29). This means that the logical categories are not merely subjective forms that we impose on an independent content, but are themselves the content of the Logic.

This unity of form and content is essential for understanding Hegel's claims about Being and Nothing. When Hegel discusses Being and Nothing, he is not talking about two separate entities that happen to have certain properties. Rather, Being and Nothing are pure thought-determinations that develop through their own internal dialectic. The form of their development (the dialectical movement) is inseparable from their content (what they are).

### The Rules Hegel Must Follow

Given these features of the Logic, we can identify several rules that Hegel must follow in his treatment of Being and Nothing:

1. He must begin with the most abstract, indeterminate category possible, without presupposing any determinate content.
2. He must allow this category to develop through its own internal dialectic, without introducing external reflections.
3. He must maintain the unity of form and content, treating the logical categories as both the method and the subject matter of the Logic.
4. He must not appeal to examples, intuitions, or representations to justify the development.
5. He must not presuppose the distinction between subject and object, or between thought and being.

These rules explain why Hegel begins the Logic with Being, which he characterizes as "pure being – without further determination" (59). Being is the most abstract, indeterminate category possible, and thus the only possible beginning for a presuppositionless logic. But as we will see, this very indeterminacy leads necessarily to Nothing, setting in motion the dialectical development that structures the entire Logic.

### Why Hegel Is Entitled to Start with Being

Given these constraints, one might wonder whether Hegel is entitled to start with Being at all. Doesn't even this most abstract category presuppose something? Hegel addresses this concern by arguing that Being is the only possible beginning precisely because it presupposes nothing. Any other beginning would already involve some determination, some content that would need to be justified. Being, as pure indeterminacy, is the only category that can serve as an absolute beginning.

Moreover, Hegel argues that the beginning must be immediate, not mediated by anything else. Being, as pure immediacy, satisfies this requirement. It is not derived from anything else but is simply posited as the beginning. As Hegel puts it, "the beginning, as the beginning of thought, must be wholly abstract, wholly general, must be pure form without any content; we should therefore have nothing but the representation of a mere beginning as such" (70).

This does not mean that Being is arbitrary or unjustified. Rather, its justification lies in the entire system that develops from it. The beginning is validated retrospectively by the coherence and comprehensiveness of the system it grounds. As Hegel writes, "the advance is not to be taken as a flowing from one to an other... Rather, it is to be found in the fact that the universal determines itself and is for itself the particular, the determinate; for it is the self-moving and self-distinguishing thought, it is its own immanence" (71).

In the next section, we will examine more closely what kind of entities Being and Nothing are, and why Hegel claims both that they are identical and that they are distinct.
