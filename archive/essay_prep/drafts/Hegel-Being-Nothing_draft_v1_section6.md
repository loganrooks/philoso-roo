# Hegel's Claims About Being and Nothing

## Section 6: The Resolution in Becoming and the Transition to Existence

Having examined the identity and difference of Being and Nothing, we can now address how this contradiction is resolved in Becoming, and how Becoming itself transitions to Existence. This resolution is crucial for understanding the role of the Being-Nothing-Becoming triad in the larger project of the Logic.

### Becoming as the Unity of Being and Nothing

Hegel characterizes Becoming as "the unity of being and nothing" (60). This unity is not a static synthesis but a dynamic movement: "Their truth is therefore this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming, a movement in which the two are distinguished, but by a distinction which has just as immediately dissolved itself" (60).

This characterization of Becoming as a movement is crucial. Becoming is not a third category that stands alongside Being and Nothing, but the movement between them. It is the truth of Being and Nothing, not as separate categories but as moments in a dialectical process.

The dynamic nature of Becoming is further emphasized by Hegel's description of it as "doubly determined" (60). Becoming has two moments: coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be. "In one determination, nothing is the immediate, that is, the determination begins with nothing and this refers to being; that is to say, it passes over into it. In the other determination, being is the immediate, that is, the determination begins with being and this passes over into nothing â€“ coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be" (60).

This double determination of Becoming reflects the dual movement from Being to Nothing and from Nothing to Being. Coming-to-be is the movement from Nothing to Being, while ceasing-to-be is the movement from Being to Nothing. These two movements are not separate but are moments of the same process.

### The Sublation of Becoming

But Becoming itself is not the final category of the Logic. It too must be sublated (aufgehoben), that is, both negated and preserved in a higher category. This happens through what Hegel calls "the vanishing of becoming" (81).

Hegel writes: "The equilibrium in which coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be are poised is in the first place becoming itself. But this becoming equally collects itself in quiescent unity. Being and nothing are in it only as vanishing; becoming itself, however, is only by virtue of their being distinguished. Their vanishing is therefore the vanishing of becoming, or the vanishing of the vanishing itself" (81).

This passage is dense but crucial. Becoming is the movement between Being and Nothing, but this movement itself must come to rest. The vanishing of Being into Nothing and Nothing into Being is itself a vanishing, and this "vanishing of the vanishing" results in a new category: Existence (Dasein).

### The Transition to Existence

Hegel describes the transition from Becoming to Existence as follows: "Becoming, as transition into the unity of being and nothing, a unity which is as existent or has the shape of the one-sided immediate unity of these moments, is existence" (81).

This passage indicates that Existence is the unity of Being and Nothing, but a unity that has become "existent" or "immediate." In other words, Existence is the result of Becoming, the point at which the movement between Being and Nothing comes to rest.

This transition is further clarified in the section on Existence: "Existence proceeds from becoming. It is the simple oneness of being and nothing. On account of this simplicity, it has the form of an immediate. Its mediation, the becoming, lies behind it; it has sublated itself, and existence therefore appears as a first from which the forward move is made" (83).

This passage emphasizes that Existence is the "simple oneness of being and nothing." But unlike Becoming, which is the dynamic movement between Being and Nothing, Existence is a "simple oneness" that has "the form of an immediate." The mediation of Becoming "lies behind it," having "sublated itself."

### The Significance of the Transition

The transition from Becoming to Existence is significant for several reasons. First, it shows that the dialectical movement does not stop with the first triad (Being-Nothing-Becoming) but continues to higher categories. The contradiction between Being and Nothing is resolved in Becoming, but Becoming itself gives rise to a new category: Existence.

Second, it illustrates the pattern of dialectical development that structures the entire Logic. Each category gives rise to its opposite, and the contradiction between them is resolved in a higher category, which in turn gives rise to new contradictions. This pattern of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis (though Hegel himself did not use these terms) is repeated throughout the Logic.

Third, it shows how the earlier categories are preserved in the later ones. Existence is not a completely new category that leaves Being, Nothing, and Becoming behind. Rather, it contains them as sublated moments. As Hegel puts it, "Being and nothing are in it [Existence] only as vanishing" (81). They are negated but also preserved in a higher unity.

### Heidegger's Perspective: The Renunciation of the Ontological Difference

Heidegger's critique of Hegel provides a useful perspective on the transition from Becoming to Existence. Heidegger argues that Hegel, like the rest of Western metaphysics, neglects what he calls the "ontological difference" between being and beings. This is the distinction between being itself and the beings that are.

Heidegger suggests that Hegel's treatment of Being, Nothing, and Becoming, and their transition to Existence, is a manifestation of the "renunciation of the difference between being and beings" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 15). For Heidegger, this neglect of the ontological difference is not a mere oversight but is constitutive of metaphysics itself.

This critique raises the question of whether Hegel's transition from Becoming to Existence is as immanent as he claims. If it presupposes the renunciation of the ontological difference, then it may not be as self-grounding as Hegel suggests.

However, it is important to note that Heidegger's critique is not a refutation of Hegel but a deepening of his thought. Heidegger is not claiming that Hegel is wrong but that his thought is limited by its metaphysical framework. By bringing attention to the ontological difference, Heidegger opens up a more originary understanding of the relationship between being and nothing.

### Conclusion: The Resolution in Becoming and the Transition to Existence

In conclusion, the contradiction between the identity and difference of Being and Nothing is resolved in Becoming, which is the movement of the immediate vanishing of Being into Nothing and Nothing into Being. But Becoming itself is not the final category of the Logic. It too must be sublated, and this sublation results in a new category: Existence.

This transition from Becoming to Existence illustrates the pattern of dialectical development that structures the entire Logic. Each category gives rise to its opposite, and the contradiction between them is resolved in a higher category, which in turn gives rise to new contradictions. This pattern is repeated throughout the Logic, making the first triad (Being-Nothing-Becoming) the paradigm for the entire dialectical development.

In the next section, we will examine the role of this first triad in the larger project of the Logic, and develop an original perspective on the relationship between Being and Nothing that goes beyond both Hegel and Heidegger.
