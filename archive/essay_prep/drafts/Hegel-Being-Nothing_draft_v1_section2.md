# Hegel's Claims About Being and Nothing

## Section 2: The Ontological Status of Being and Nothing

Having situated Hegel's claims within the project of the *Science of Logic*, we must now clarify what kind of entities Being and Nothing are. This is crucial for understanding why Hegel claims both that "Being is Nothing" and that "Being is not Nothing." When we ask about the ontological status of Being and Nothing, we are asking: What are we talking about when we talk about 'Being' and 'Nothing'? Are they concepts, representations, entities, words, or something else entirely?

### Not Entities or Things

First, it is important to understand that Being and Nothing are not entities or things in the ordinary sense. They are not objects that exist in the world alongside other objects. As Hegel puts it, "Being, pure being – without further determination" (59) is not any particular being or entity. Similarly, Nothing is not a particular absence or lack, but "pure nothingness" (59).

This point is often misunderstood, leading to confusion about Hegel's claims. When Hegel says that "Being is Nothing," he is not making a claim about the identity of two distinct entities. Rather, he is making a claim about the identity of two pure thought-determinations.

### Not Mere Representations or Concepts

Second, Being and Nothing are not mere representations or concepts in the ordinary sense. They are not subjective ideas that we form about objects, nor are they general concepts that we abstract from particular instances. Hegel is critical of the view that treats logical categories as merely subjective forms that we impose on an independent content. For Hegel, the logical categories are not merely subjective but have an objective status.

This is why Hegel describes logic as "the exposition of God as he is in his eternal essence before the creation of nature and of a finite spirit" (29). The logical categories are not merely our way of thinking about reality; they are the fundamental structure of reality itself. As Hegel puts it, "the necessary forms of thinking, and its specific determinations, are the content and the ultimate truth itself" (29).

### Pure Thought-Determinations

So what are Being and Nothing? They are what Hegel calls "pure thought-determinations" (reine Gedankenbestimmungen). These are not subjective concepts but objective determinations of thought itself. They are the most basic categories through which thought grasps reality.

Heidegger helps us understand this point in his analysis of Hegel's concept of being. He writes that for Hegel, "Being conceived of as indeterminacy and immediacy. (That Hegel says: 'Being is the indeterminate immediate,' shows only that he equates being and beings in general understood in the ordinary sense—in accordance with the metaphysical habituation, more specifically, however, according to the idealistic mode of thinking.)" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 16). Heidegger suggests that Hegel's concept of being is determined by the horizon of thoughtness, which is the presupposition of Western metaphysics.

This means that Being and Nothing are not entities or concepts in the ordinary sense, but pure thought-determinations that constitute the beginning of the logical development. They are the most abstract, indeterminate categories through which thought grasps reality.

### The Objective Status of Thought-Determinations

It is important to emphasize that for Hegel, these thought-determinations are not merely subjective but have an objective status. This is a key aspect of Hegel's idealism, which rejects the sharp distinction between thought and reality that characterizes much of modern philosophy.

For Hegel, thought is not something separate from reality, imposing its forms on an independent content. Rather, thought is the self-development of reality itself. The logical categories are not merely our way of thinking about reality; they are the fundamental structure of reality itself. As Hegel puts it in the *Encyclopedia*, "Everything we know both of outward and inward nature, in one word, the objective world, is in its own self the same as it is in thought, and thought is the form of the thing" (Encyclopedia §24, Addition 1).

This means that when Hegel discusses Being and Nothing, he is not merely talking about our concepts of being and nothing, but about being and nothing themselves as pure thought-determinations. The dialectical movement from Being to Nothing to Becoming is not merely a movement of our thinking, but a movement of reality itself.

### Heidegger's Critique: The Ontological Difference

Heidegger's critique of Hegel provides a useful perspective on the ontological status of Being and Nothing. Heidegger argues that Hegel, like the rest of Western metaphysics, neglects what he calls the "ontological difference" between being and beings. This is the distinction between being itself and the beings that are.

Heidegger writes that "This grounding difference is what in *Being and Time* we called 'ontological difference'" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 15). He suggests that Hegel's claim that the distinction between being and nothing is none is a manifestation of the "renunciation of the difference between being and beings" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 15).

For Heidegger, this neglect of the ontological difference is not a mere oversight but is constitutive of metaphysics itself. He writes that "Dis-mantling and renunciation are the 'beginning' of the absolute. Is the latter itself in its own manner the master of these 'negations'? And how so? Or are they that which the absolute suppresses and perhaps also can suppress for itself" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 16).

This critique suggests that Hegel's treatment of Being and Nothing as pure thought-determinations, while profound, may still be limited by its metaphysical framework. By neglecting the ontological difference, Hegel may be unable to think being in its most originary sense.

### Conclusion: Being and Nothing as Pure Thought-Determinations

In conclusion, Being and Nothing are not entities, representations, or concepts in the ordinary sense, but pure thought-determinations with an objective status. They are the most abstract, indeterminate categories through which thought grasps reality. This understanding of the ontological status of Being and Nothing is crucial for understanding why Hegel claims both that "Being is Nothing" and that "Being is not Nothing."

In the next section, we will examine more closely the nature of Being and Nothing themselves, showing why they are both identical and distinct.
