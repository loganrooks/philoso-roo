# Hegel's Claims About Being and Nothing

## Section 5: The Identity and Difference of Being and Nothing

Having examined the nature of Being and Nothing and how Hegel "gets from" one to the other, we can now directly address the apparent contradiction in Hegel's claims: Why is Being Nothing, and why is Being not Nothing? Does Hegel have convincing reasons for making both claims?

### Why Being Is Nothing

Hegel's claim that "Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact nothing, and neither more nor less than nothing" (59) follows from the nature of Being and Nothing as pure thought-determinations. As we have seen, Being is pure indeterminacy, with no specific content or determination. But this very indeterminacy makes it identical to Nothing, which is also pure indeterminacy.

The identity of Being and Nothing is not a mere assertion but follows from their nature. If Being is pure indeterminacy, then there is nothing determinate in it. But if there is nothing determinate in it, then it is Nothing. Conversely, if Nothing is the complete absence of determination and content, then it is indistinguishable from pure, indeterminate Being.

Hegel makes this point explicitly: "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same" (59). This is not a paradoxical claim but a necessary consequence of the nature of Being and Nothing as pure thought-determinations.

This identity is also evident in the fact that both Being and Nothing are unthinkable in their purity. As Hegel puts it, "There is nothing to be intuited in it [Being], if one can speak here of intuiting; or, it is only this pure empty intuiting itself. Just as little is anything to be thought in it, or, it is equally only this empty thinking" (59). Similarly, "To intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning; the two are distinguished and so nothing is (concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather it is the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being" (59).

In other words, the attempt to think pure Being and the attempt to think pure Nothing both result in the same thing: empty thinking. This is why Being and Nothing are identical.

### Why Being Is Not Nothing

But Hegel also claims that "they are not without distinction; it is rather that they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable, and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite" (59-60). How can Being and Nothing be both identical and distinct?

The key is to understand that the distinction between Being and Nothing is not a distinction of content (since both are completely indeterminate) but a distinction of orientation or perspective. Being is the positive attempt to think pure indeterminacy, while Nothing is the negative recognition of the failure of this attempt. Being is, so to speak, indeterminacy posited positively, while Nothing is indeterminacy posited negatively.

This distinction is subtle but crucial. It is not a fixed, static opposition but a dynamic movement. As Hegel puts it, "each immediately vanishes in its opposite" (60). The attempt to think pure Being fails because there is nothing determinate to think, leading to Nothing. But the attempt to think pure Nothing also fails, leading back to Being. This movement between Being and Nothing is what Hegel calls Becoming.

The distinction between Being and Nothing is also evident in the fact that they are approached differently in thought. Being is approached as something positive, as the attempt to think pure indeterminacy. Nothing, on the other hand, is approached as something negative, as the recognition of the failure of this attempt. This difference in approach constitutes a real distinction, even if the content of what is thought (or rather, what fails to be thought) is the same.

### The Dialectical Unity of Identity and Difference

The apparent contradiction in Hegel's claims—that Being is Nothing and that Being is not Nothing—is resolved when we understand that these claims refer to different aspects of the relationship between Being and Nothing. Being is Nothing in terms of content, as both are completely indeterminate. But Being is not Nothing in terms of orientation or perspective, as they are approached differently in thought.

This dialectical unity of identity and difference is characteristic of Hegel's thought. For Hegel, contradiction is not a sign of error but a necessary moment in the self-development of thought. The contradiction between the identity and difference of Being and Nothing is not a problem to be solved but a dynamic tension that drives the dialectical movement forward.

As Hegel puts it, "Their truth is therefore this movement of the immediate vanishing of the one into the other: becoming, a movement in which the two are distinguished, but by a distinction which has just as immediately dissolved itself" (60). The truth of Being and Nothing is not found in either one taken in isolation, nor in their static identity, but in their dynamic movement into each other.

### Heidegger's Perspective: The Abyssal Contrast of Beyng

Heidegger's perspective on the relationship between being and nothing provides a useful contrast to Hegel's. For Heidegger, "The nothing is the abyssal contrast of beyng, but as this its essence" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 16). This suggests that the nothing is not simply opposed to being but is intrinsic to it, as its "abyssal contrast."

Heidegger also distinguishes between different senses of the "not" and the nothing. He writes, "The not of beings—being (and not the nothing). The not of being—the originary nothing" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 15). This suggests that the nothing that is opposed to beings is different from the nothing that is intrinsic to being itself.

For Heidegger, "To think the nothing means: to inquire into the truth of beyng and to experience the distress [Not] of the totality of beings. To think the nothing is not nihilism" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 16). This suggests that thinking the nothing is not a negative or destructive activity but a way of inquiring into the truth of being itself.

These insights from Heidegger suggest a more originary understanding of the relationship between being and nothing than what is found in Hegel. For Heidegger, the nothing is not simply the negation of being but is intrinsic to being itself, as its "abyssal contrast." This perspective opens up new possibilities for thinking the relationship between being and nothing.

### Conclusion: The Dialectical Unity of Being and Nothing

In conclusion, Hegel has convincing reasons for claiming both that Being is Nothing and that Being is not Nothing. These claims are not contradictory but refer to different aspects of the relationship between Being and Nothing. Being is Nothing in terms of content, as both are completely indeterminate. But Being is not Nothing in terms of orientation or perspective, as they are approached differently in thought.

This dialectical unity of identity and difference is not a logical error but a necessary moment in the self-development of thought. It is resolved in Becoming, which is the movement of the immediate vanishing of Being into Nothing and Nothing into Being.

In the next section, we will examine how this contradiction is resolved in Becoming and how this resolution leads to the category of Existence.
