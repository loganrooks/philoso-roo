# Hegel's Claims About Being and Nothing

## Section 3: The Nature of Being and Nothing

Having clarified the ontological status of Being and Nothing as pure thought-determinations, we can now examine their nature more closely. What exactly is Being, and what is Nothing? And why does Hegel claim both that they are identical and that they are distinct?

### The Nature of Pure Being

Hegel characterizes Being as "pure being â€“ without further determination" (59). This means that Being is completely indeterminate and immediate. It has no specific qualities, no internal distinctions, and no relations to anything outside itself. As Hegel puts it:

"In its indeterminate immediacy it is equal only to itself and also not unequal with respect to another; it has no difference within it, nor any outwardly. If any determination or content were posited in it as distinct, or if it were posited by this determination or content as distinct from an other, it would thereby fail to hold fast to its purity. It is pure indeterminateness and emptiness." (59)

This characterization of Being as pure indeterminacy is crucial for understanding why Hegel begins the Logic with it. As we saw in Section 1, Hegel seeks a presuppositionless beginning, which means starting with the most abstract, indeterminate category possible. Being, as pure indeterminacy, satisfies this requirement.

But this very indeterminacy creates a problem. If Being is completely indeterminate, then there is nothing to think in it. As Hegel puts it, "There is nothing to be intuited in it, if one can speak here of intuiting; or, it is only this pure empty intuiting itself. Just as little is anything to be thought in it, or, it is equally only this empty thinking" (59). In other words, the attempt to think pure Being fails because there is nothing determinate to think.

### The Nature of Pure Nothing

Hegel characterizes Nothing in similar terms: "Nothing, pure nothingness; it is simple equality with itself, complete emptiness, complete absence of determination and content; lack of all distinction within" (59). Like Being, Nothing is completely indeterminate and immediate. It has no specific qualities, no internal distinctions, and no relations to anything outside itself.

This parallel characterization is crucial for understanding why Hegel claims that Being and Nothing are identical. Both are completely indeterminate and empty. Both lack any specific content or determination. Both are immediate, with no internal distinctions or external relations.

But there is a subtle difference. Being is the positive attempt to think pure indeterminacy, while Nothing is the negative recognition of the failure of this attempt. As Hegel puts it, "To intuit or to think nothing has therefore a meaning; the two are distinguished and so nothing is (concretely exists) in our intuiting or thinking; or rather it is the empty intuiting and thinking itself, like pure being" (59). In other words, Nothing is not simply the absence of thought, but the thought of absence.

### The Identity of Being and Nothing

Given these characterizations, Hegel's claim that "Being, the indeterminate immediate is in fact nothing, and neither more nor less than nothing" (59) becomes more comprehensible. Being and Nothing are identical because both are completely indeterminate and empty. Both lack any specific content or determination. Both are immediate, with no internal distinctions or external relations.

This identity is not a mere assertion but follows from the nature of Being and Nothing themselves. If Being is pure indeterminacy, then there is nothing determinate in it. But if there is nothing determinate in it, then it is Nothing. Conversely, if Nothing is the complete absence of determination and content, then it is indistinguishable from pure, indeterminate Being.

Hegel makes this point explicitly: "Pure being and pure nothing are therefore the same" (59). This is not a paradoxical claim but a necessary consequence of the nature of Being and Nothing as pure thought-determinations.

### The Difference Between Being and Nothing

But Hegel also claims that Being and Nothing are distinct: "But the truth is just as much that they are not without distinction; it is rather that they are not the same, that they are absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable, and that each immediately vanishes in its opposite" (59-60). How can they be both identical and distinct?

The key is to understand that the distinction between Being and Nothing is not a distinction of content (since both are completely indeterminate) but a distinction of orientation or perspective. Being is the positive attempt to think pure indeterminacy, while Nothing is the negative recognition of the failure of this attempt. Being is, so to speak, indeterminacy posited positively, while Nothing is indeterminacy posited negatively.

This distinction is subtle but crucial. It is not a fixed, static opposition but a dynamic movement. As Hegel puts it, "each immediately vanishes in its opposite" (60). The attempt to think pure Being fails because there is nothing determinate to think, leading to Nothing. But the attempt to think pure Nothing also fails, leading back to Being. This movement between Being and Nothing is what Hegel calls Becoming.

### The Dynamic Nature of the Distinction

It is important to emphasize that the distinction between Being and Nothing is not a fixed, static opposition but a dynamic movement. Being and Nothing are not two separate entities that stand over against each other. Rather, they are moments in a dialectical movement, each passing over into the other.

This dynamic nature of the distinction is what Hegel means when he says that Being and Nothing are "absolutely distinct yet equally unseparated and inseparable" (60). They are distinct in their orientation or perspective, but they are inseparable because each immediately passes over into the other.

Heidegger helps us understand this point in his analysis of Hegel's concept of being and nothing. He writes that "The nothing is the abyssal contrast of beyng, but as this its essence" (Heidegger, "Negativity," 16). This suggests that the nothing is not simply opposed to being but is intrinsic to it, as its "abyssal contrast."

### Conclusion: The Identity and Difference of Being and Nothing

In conclusion, Being and Nothing are identical in their content (or lack thereof) but different in their orientation or perspective. Both are completely indeterminate and empty, but Being is the positive attempt to think pure indeterminacy, while Nothing is the negative recognition of the failure of this attempt.

This understanding of the nature of Being and Nothing allows us to make sense of Hegel's seemingly contradictory claims. Being is Nothing because both are completely indeterminate and empty. But Being is not Nothing because they have different orientations or perspectives.

In the next section, we will examine how Hegel "gets from" Being to Nothing through the immanent dialectic of thought, and how this contradiction is resolved in Becoming.
