## Concepts Under Development
1. **Pure Being (reines Sein)** - Status: DETERMINATION COMPLETE
   - Positive Determination: The most abstract, indeterminate concept possible; immediate (not mediated by anything else); equal only to itself; empty intuiting and empty thinking
   - Negative Determination: Not a determinate entity or thing; not the existence of any particular thing; not mediated by anything else
   - Source: Science of Logic, p. 59

2. **Nothing (Nichts)** - Status: DETERMINATION COMPLETE
   - Positive Determination: Complete emptiness and absence of determination; simple equality with itself; lack of all distinction within; the empty intuiting and thinking itself
   - Negative Determination: Not a determinate negation (the negation of something specific); not the absence of any particular thing
   - Source: Science of Logic, p. 59

3. **Identity of Being and Nothing** - Status: DETERMINATION COMPLETE
   - Positive Determination: Both are completely indeterminate and empty; both lack all determination and content; both are simple equality with themselves
   - Negative Determination: Not based on external comparison; not a static relation but a movement or transition
   - Source: Science of Logic, p. 59

4. **Difference between Being and Nothing** - Status: DETERMINATION COMPLETE
   - Positive Determination: Different orientations or perspectives; Being as positive attempt to think pure indeterminacy, Nothing as negative recognition of failure of this attempt
   - Negative Determination: Not a difference in content (since both are contentless); not a stable distinction but one that immediately dissolves itself
   - Source: Science of Logic, p. 60

5. **Becoming (Werden)** - Status: DETERMINATION COMPLETE
   - Positive Determination: Unity of Being and Nothing; movement of immediate vanishing of Being into Nothing and Nothing into Being; doubly determined as coming-to-be and ceasing-to-be
   - Negative Determination: Not a temporal process but a logical movement; not a third concept alongside Being and Nothing but their truth
   - Source: Science of Logic, p. 60

6. **Dialectical Movement** - Status: DETERMINATION COMPLETE
   - Positive Determination: Process by which categories develop through contradiction and resolution; dynamic movement that drives development forward
   - Negative Determination: Not external reflection or comparison; not a temporal process; not arbitrary but follows from the nature of the concepts themselves
   - Source: Throughout Science of Logic

## Pending Determinations
All key concepts have received both positive and negative determinations. No pending determinations at this time.

### Thesis Development
- File: essay_prep/theses/Hegel-Being-Nothing_thesis_v1.md
- Status: COMPLETE
- Working Thesis: "Hegel's seemingly contradictory claims that Being is Nothing and Being is not Nothing are both justified within his Science of Logic because they reflect different moments in the dialectical development of thought: their identity stems from their shared complete indeterminacy, while their difference emerges from their distinct orientations as positive and negative moments in the dialectical process, a tension that drives the emergence of Becoming as their truth."

## Analysis Notes
The essay development is proceeding well, with the planning phase nearly complete. The prompt has been thoroughly analyzed, a strong thesis has been developed, and a detailed outline has been created. The next step is to gather and analyze all the textual evidence needed for each section of the essay.

The thesis effectively addresses both parts of the question (why Being is Nothing and why Being is not Nothing) and connects them to Hegel's broader project. The outline provides a clear structure that addresses all the required issues while developing a coherent argument.

One challenge will be balancing technical accuracy with accessibility for a non-specialist audience. This will require careful explanation of Hegel's terminology and concepts without oversimplification. Another challenge will be integrating direct quotations from Hegel's text in a way that supports the argument without overwhelming the reader.

## Next Steps
1. Gather and analyze all textual evidence needed for each section
2. Begin drafting the introduction based on the outline
3. Draft each section of the main body, ensuring all requirements are addressed
4. Draft the conclusion that ties together the key arguments
5. Review and revise for clarity, coherence, and scholarly rigor
