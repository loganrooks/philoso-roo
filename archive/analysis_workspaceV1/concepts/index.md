# Concept Index

This index tracks key philosophical concepts across lectures and readings in PHL316.

## Core Concepts

### Natural Consciousness
- Definition: Pre-philosophical starting point that assumes distinction between itself and its objects
- First appears: Jan 7 Lecture Part 1
- Textual basis: Introduction ¶73-74
- Key aspects:
  - Contains its own standard of knowledge
  - Internally divided between knowledge and truth
  - Starting point for phenomenological investigation

### Experience (Erfahrung)
- Definition: Dialectical movement through which consciousness tests and revises its conception of knowledge
- First appears: Jan 7 Lecture Part 2
- Textual basis: Introduction ¶86
- Distinguished from:
  - Ordinary empirical experience
  - Kantian synthesis of perceptions
- Key features:
  - Self-testing movement
  - Produces new objects through negation
  - Affects both knowledge and its object

### Dialectical Movement
- Definition: Self-development through which consciousness undermines its conceptions through internal contradiction
- First appears: Jan 7 Lecture Part 2
- Textual basis: Introduction ¶79
- Key aspects:
  - Produces determinate negation
  - Generates necessary progression
  - Results contain truth of previous stage

### Science
- Definition: Systematic knowing that develops from within
- First appears: Jan 7 Lecture Part 1
- Refined in: Introduction ¶88
- Dual aspect:
  - Path to absolute knowing
  - Goal of phenomenological development
- Key insight: "The way to Science is itself already Science"

### Truth
- Definition: Initially the in-itself that knowledge aims to grasp; develops into correspondence of concept and object
- Textual basis: Introduction ¶84
- Key aspects:
  - Relational rather than absolute
  - Develops through stages
  - Connected to self-consciousness

### For-Us vs For-Consciousness
- Definition: Distinction between phenomenological observation and consciousness's self-understanding
- First appears: Jan 7 Lecture Part 2
- Textual basis: Introduction ¶87
- Key usage:
  - Organizing principle of analysis
  - Shows necessity of progression
  - Maintains immanent development

## Methodological Concepts

### Determinate Negation
- Definition: Negation that produces specific positive content rather than mere absence
- First appears: Jan 7 Lecture Part 2
- Textual basis: Introduction ¶79
- Key features:
  - Contains truth of what is negated
  - Drives progression forward
  - Generates new content

### Being-In-Itself vs Being-For-Another
- Definition: Distinction within consciousness between truth and knowledge
- Textual basis: Introduction ¶82-83
- Key features:
  - Internal to consciousness
  - Enables self-testing
  - Ground of experience

## Relations Between Concepts
- [natural consciousness → experience] Through self-testing
- [experience → science] As development of knowledge
- [dialectical movement → determinate negation] As method of progression
- [truth → science] As goal and process
- [for-us → scientific progression] As organizing principle
