## Key Sections

### 1. Course Structure & Hegel's System (Lines 1-105)

- Problem of distorted reception
- Task of fully understanding Hegel remains incomplete

### 3. Method & Natural Consciousness (Lines 376-394)
- Rejection of external overviews in favor of internal development
- Philosophy must develop from itself rather than external narration
- Natural consciousness as starting point

### 4. The Dialectical Structure (Lines 838-945)
- Consciousness provides its own standard
- Self-examination rather than external criteria
- Dialectical movement as self-development

4. {concept: spirit} - Consciousness that understands itself truly
