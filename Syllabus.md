## Course Description  
This course will be an introduction to the philosophy of G.W.F. Hegel (1770–1831). We will read selections from Hegel’s writings that constitute his philosophical "system": the *Phenomenology of Spirit* (as the introduction to the system) and the *Encyclopedia of Philosophical Sciences* (the system itself), including its three parts: logic/metaphysics, philosophy of nature, and philosophy of spirit. Time permitting, we will also explore supplementary texts such as the *Science of Logic*, *Philosophy of Right*, and Hegel’s lectures on religion, aesthetics, and history.  

The course emphasizes:  
- Hegel’s concept of a philosophical system.  
- Why philosophy, for Hegel, must take systematic form.  
- The structure of the system as a "circle of circles" (each part forming its own circular structure within the whole).  

*Note:* The only formal prerequisite is **PHL 210** (concurrent enrollment is sufficient), but students are strongly encouraged to complete **PHL 314 (Kant)** beforehand.
